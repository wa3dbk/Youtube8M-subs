okay<00:00:03.270> got<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.510> Aeroforce<00:00:03.899> can<00:00:04.319> gauge<00:00:06.560> check

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
okay got the Aeroforce can gauge check

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:23.550 
okay got the Aeroforce can gauge check
it<00:00:07.680> out<00:00:07.799> here

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.290 

so<00:00:24.160> it's<00:00:24.340> set<00:00:24.550> up<00:00:24.580> for<00:00:24.700> ICP<00:00:25.680> duty<00:00:26.680> cycle<00:00:27.160> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so it's set up for ICP duty cycle and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:40.600 
so it's set up for ICP duty cycle and
map<00:00:28.300> pressure<00:00:28.690> right<00:00:28.990> now

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.000 

the<00:00:41.000> button<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.510> left

cycles through

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.900 
cycles through
so<00:00:45.839> now<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.199> injector<00:00:46.649> pulse<00:00:46.890> width

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.700 

you<00:01:23.570> can<00:01:23.690> see<00:01:23.870> I<00:01:23.900> can<00:01:24.140> cycle<00:01:24.350> back<00:01:24.680> through

there's<00:01:29.430> injector<00:01:29.910> pressure<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.480> then

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
there's injector pressure and then

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:56.040 
there's injector pressure and then
having<00:01:31.080> duty-cycle<00:01:31.800> at<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.550> time

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.580 

I<00:01:56.140> haven't<00:01:56.920> put<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.250> my<00:01:57.600> analog<00:01:58.600> oil<00:01:59.230> pressure

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
I haven't put in my analog oil pressure

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.070 
I haven't put in my analog oil pressure
and<00:01:59.740> fuel<00:02:00.010> pressure<00:02:00.390> sensors<00:02:01.390> yet<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:01.990> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
and fuel pressure sensors yet so I just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.420 
and fuel pressure sensors yet so I just
wanted<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.530> play<00:02:02.650> with<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.040> little<00:02:03.220> bit

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
wanted to play with this a little bit

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.430 
wanted to play with this a little bit
check<00:02:03.670> out<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.060> works<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.260> actually

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
check out how it works you can actually

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:16.780 
check out how it works you can actually
check<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.920> torque<00:02:06.160> converter<00:02:06.280> slip

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.520 

I<00:02:16.879> have<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.269> see<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.689> actually<00:02:17.719> works<00:02:18.079> I

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
I have to see if that actually works I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.959 
I have to see if that actually works I
haven't<00:02:18.769> seen<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> work<00:02:19.159> right<00:02:19.400> yet<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.909> I'm

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
haven't seen it work right yet so I'm

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.210 
haven't seen it work right yet so I'm
not<00:02:20.030> sure

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.410 

to<00:02:25.940> get<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.360> main

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to get to the main

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.280 
to get to the main
we<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:28.960> push<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.320> two<00:02:29.470> buttons<00:02:29.800> together

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
we just push the two buttons together

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.520 
we just push the two buttons together
left<00:02:31.620> button<00:02:31.980> Scrolls<00:02:32.340> right<00:02:32.670> button<00:02:33.530> selects

you<00:02:39.709> can<00:02:39.829> do<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.069> setup

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you can do the setup

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.550 
you can do the setup
you<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.550> do<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> psychic<00:02:43.180> scan<00:02:43.540> or<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.170> cycles

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
you can do a psychic scan or it cycles

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.630 
you can do a psychic scan or it cycles
through

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
through

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.320 
through
all<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> different<00:02:46.480> ones

miles-per-gallon<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.560> sure<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.920> won't

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
miles-per-gallon I'm sure that won't

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.580 
miles-per-gallon I'm sure that won't
work<00:03:47.280> either

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.100 

we<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.830> reset<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:51.150> where<00:03:51.330> my<00:03:51.480> analog<00:03:51.840> 1

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
we can reset it that's where my analog 1

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.010 
we can reset it that's where my analog 1
and<00:03:52.290> analog<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.099> will<00:03:53.250> be<00:03:53.280> my<00:03:54.020> oil

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
and analog to that will be my oil

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.559 
and analog to that will be my oil
pressure<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.410> feel<00:03:55.620> pressure<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.420> can

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
pressure and feel pressure you can

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.410 
pressure and feel pressure you can
choose<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.930> different<00:03:58.110> logos<00:03:58.650> here

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.290 

you<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:04.020> there<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:05.120> interceptors<00:04:06.120> right

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
you see there is a interceptors right

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.270 
you see there is a interceptors right
now<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.660> selected

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.410 

scroll<00:04:09.820> down<00:04:09.850> through<00:04:10.360> each<00:04:10.450> one

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:26.850 

and<00:04:15.750> course<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.230> best<00:04:16.440> one

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:36.400 

they<00:04:27.250> use<00:04:27.580> these<00:04:27.789> little<00:04:28.030> buttons

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.050 

and<00:04:36.740> that's<00:04:36.920> what<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.130> powerstroke<00:04:37.460> piece<00:04:37.880> of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
and that's what the powerstroke piece of

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.170 
and that's what the powerstroke piece of
one<00:04:38.210> looks<00:04:38.390> like

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.850 

so<00:04:41.450> if<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.750> hold<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.050> button<00:04:42.080> down<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.560> scans

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
so if you hold the button down it scans

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.270 
so if you hold the button down it scans
pretty<00:04:43.160> fast

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330 

you<00:04:49.850> can<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.090> tire<00:04:50.330> size<00:04:51.070> apply<00:04:52.070> for<00:04:52.280> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
you can do tire size apply for the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.640 
you can do tire size apply for the
mile-per-hour<00:04:53.180> thing<00:04:53.900> in<00:04:54.050> here<00:04:54.170> see<00:04:54.410> if<00:04:54.530> if

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
mile-per-hour thing in here see if if

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.990 
mile-per-hour thing in here see if if
you<00:04:54.770> need<00:04:54.889> to<00:04:55.010> adjust<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.520> change<00:04:55.850> a

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
you need to adjust you can change a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.409 
you need to adjust you can change a
little<00:04:56.240> bit<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:57.050> then<00:04:57.200> controls<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:59.210> is

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
little bit and then controls this is

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.309 
little bit and then controls this is
where<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.960> do<00:05:00.050> your<00:05:00.350> tests

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
where you can do your tests

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.889 
where you can do your tests
so<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.889> can<00:05:03.009> do<00:05:03.129> the<00:05:03.279> psoas<00:05:03.819> test<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:04.899 
so you can do the psoas test the

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.200 
so you can do the psoas test the
cylinder<00:05:05.319> test

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
cylinder test

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:20.040 
cylinder test
go<00:05:07.660> ahead<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.900> do<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.080> contribution<00:05:08.740> tests

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.940 

now<00:05:20.410> it's<00:05:20.590> testing

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.550 

and<00:05:25.430> then<00:05:25.610> no<00:05:25.760> coats<00:05:26.290> only<00:05:27.290> because<00:05:27.440> I'm

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
and then no coats only because I'm

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.200 
and then no coats only because I'm
running<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.950> black<00:05:28.160> canvas<00:05:28.490> in<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:28.910> center

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
running a black canvas in the center

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.330 
running a black canvas in the center
though

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.100 

so<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.000> goes<00:05:33.150> back<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.660> we'll<00:05:33.780> go<00:05:33.900> back<00:05:36.050> okay<00:05:37.050> so

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
so it goes back so we'll go back okay so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:45.830 
so it goes back so we'll go back okay so
for<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.530> buzz<00:05:37.710> test<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:40.740> select<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.690> then

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
for the buzz test you select it and then

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.820 
for the buzz test you select it and then
you<00:05:45.990> go<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.170> exit<00:05:48.140> now<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.260> tells<00:05:49.410> me<00:05:49.590> what<00:05:49.710> the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
you go to exit now it tells me what the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:11.500 
you go to exit now it tells me what the
key<00:05:50.010> on<00:05:50.220> engine<00:05:50.880> off<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.510> push<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.930> button

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.650 

and<00:06:12.510> there<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.900> buzz<00:06:13.080> test<00:06:13.320> is<00:06:13.470> done
