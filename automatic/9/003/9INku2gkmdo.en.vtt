00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.780
 so hold last comes to a new one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 little tutorial on our channel 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.930
 Today I show you how you feel about it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.660
 Download language package from glp 96 and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 we can install the whole thing 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 yes actually before a few 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 months made at that time was the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.979
 savings package and for 80 times 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 downloaded and now have us said 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.399
 that we extend that again at that time 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.519
 there was a quick, for example, even 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.649
 not that we are expanding the new one now 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.929
 change things and change things 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.690
 so on and you that again for 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:54.049
 download provided in advance said 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.139
 Everything I say now I say 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.639
 to my best knowledge so like me 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:02.639
 I know I am also with a few 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.199
 other youtube exchanged those too 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.850
 Tomorrow if you have any tricks 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.850
 can I have written three 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 hello if you can see if it still 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 there are any tricks and then have 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 stop that now so we crumbled together 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.050
 as I think best 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.030
 to say first if I have anything 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.850
 should not go lose everything like that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 Do as it is with me and then it 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 you can not do it then lies then 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.730
 I assume that is no liability 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.050
 that means you do not have to be that 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.580
 Write a comment Here it is for me 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.650
 there it can be that it is not 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.210
 I have worked myself 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 I just have one word 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 changed or a letter somewhere 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490
 and then we went if we did not already 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.450
 more 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 and then I have a few version 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.330
 Waited and then it went again 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.750
 that's what makes me abusive 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.920
 very sorry for you and unfortunately you have 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 bad luck then I can too 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 do nothing but for the people who 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.380
 nevertheless our language 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.360
 want to download and still 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.830
 I want to play with him now 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 that's okay it's not really 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.729
 finished but it will be the same as 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 the last time I start 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.350
 Just go first 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:14.950
 go in your browser and take it 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.360
 url I'll take you to the video now 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 video describes and redirects them 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.930
 a well-groomed way that's us 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 I do not exist now or simply 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.420
 I took that language and gave it to me 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.120
 won by the last time 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.270
 since then this comes on 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.710
 download then you see the 690 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.060
 sprachpaket it can also be different 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.640
 I do not know what it's called like that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.160
 said the last time I have the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.350
 process is exactly the same then 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.210
 he saves that and then you should 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.800
 so open with winter so if you 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.730
 if there is also a link in the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.690
 You should write that down 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.570
 Motherland, of course, I will 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.790
 sometime buy the full version so in 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.790
 This winter some are now five 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.020
 files once a change list where 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.300
 we still write down everything exactly what 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.860
 we have changed 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.210
 she is not updater like that said 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.490
 I do not say that because of data 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.580
 Not everything is true then 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.750
 sprachpaket a little tutorial yet 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.420
 once to read 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 be simply the terms of use 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.600
 that the rich in it that you if you 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.340
 to use that and videos on youtube 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.320
 make us a little chic 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.580
 that should write that you do that 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.620
 we do not do that 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.790
 not our copyright but us 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.640
 Just want to know if you can 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.709
 used and again for recovery 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.350
 Let's say I read Tricks original file 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.980
 okay what makes you live you the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.980
 sparpaket 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.800
 is copied pushes control definitely 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.990
 case still a clipboard 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.310
 then you open the windows explorer 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.530
 go where your battlefield 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.880
 have installed play4free that was too 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.200
 in the tutorial that I now times 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.300
 made a problem because many people 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.880
 were in documents battlefield play4free 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.910
 watson and then cash comes here if you 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.780
 then you are not in the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.440
 installation files but in yours 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.480
 own file so it goes then so 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 usually playful times studied 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.160
 has this on your hard drive 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.200
 programs x86 games battlefield 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.620
 play4free then it is right if you 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.530
 that looks then needs to mail and then 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.400
 on localization and there you will find the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.650
 File the iss to kill applies here 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.990
 her now the file is in 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.430
 language package 1 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.750
 then put this out or talk 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.490
 one more time assuring the noodle 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.680
 save but actually you have them 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.750
 Also in here is exactly that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.040
 same but so can you 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.780
 actually delete but we can too 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.040
 then save ours 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.960
 sprachpaket um in strings so and then 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.070
 are you already done it will be 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.900
 of course because this work 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.700
 Now of the 13 something is like 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.340
 already at the 1 5 something that means it 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.380
 here is an attitude at 8 under 2012 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.220
 that will not work but of the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.070
 principle 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.350
 if you are your old one again 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.880
 change then take the strings here 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.520
 out she pulls in 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.010
 delete the murdered and call this 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.450
 again it is important that the 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.890
 here is only one file in it if 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.420
 we wanted to play these ostrings 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.120
 be called 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.600
 ok, now you have that again sometimes 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.220
 murder 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.140
 No , I would like to show you this for a moment 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.510
 as a last time also confusion and gave 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.850
 That's why I explain so fast 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.070
 if now have a mod in it then you can 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.669
 you just do not play with it for too long 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.520
 update comes out means he knows all - 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.010
 no matter when is an update of 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.100
 Battlefield Play4Free comes out it comes 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.740
 not anymore and then it is important that 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.229
 her if an update comes out not that 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.820
 update makes but only the old 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.380
 sphinx file as when I time of the game 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.770
 in English more normal in German 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.319
 player 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.470
 in English normal day in 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.259
 Schedule Battlefield Play pays off 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.199
 and shows this window walls that looks 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.860
 then do not accept or exactly 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.470
 then close the sun again then close 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.789
 go back to your strings then the 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:10.240
 insert original file delete again 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.949
 and tomorrow and then you can do that 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.569
 start again and then you can do it 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.009
 The update will not do it now 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.770
 We also make this part I just 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.360
 was used again an old but 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.310
 then theoretically the update could 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.110
 do 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.090
 okay that will be the important things 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.250
 You know, I hope you have fun 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.750
 with our language package it is one 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.810
 a bit expensive because we are not for 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.430
 every single mini-version we have to 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.990
 everything again from scratch modern and 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.849
 that's actually a pretty big one 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.409
 Effort we try it now in 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.639
 next time times regular 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.190
 rausbringen we can not promise 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.180
 that it's really about every single one 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.469
 version comes and also important if 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.699
 you have your language package you have to 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.690
 German is the German 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.979
 texts have been changed 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.990
 you can in french and polish 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.789
 continue playing in the normal file her 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.250
 you have to be on top of german with that 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.479
 something is murdered but here is 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.530
 it can not update now synonymous 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.449
 Maybe it's bad because now 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.199
 All fate is my powder 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.039
 Missed 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:07.449
 if i should happen then the 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.469
 use original file if it is then 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.960
 you still can not do it then you have to 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:13.150
 Unfortunately, reinstall the game 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.770
 may happen but you have it too 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.199
 really great language packages really much 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.159
 I have made it hope that it goes 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.169
 no matter 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.909
 then I hope that we have a lot of fun with 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:26.400
 thank you for watching and 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:26.400
 say goodbye and see you next time
