00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.380 

when<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:14.960> hold<00:06:15.200> up<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:16.070> black<00:06:16.310> 3<00:06:16.730> on<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.030> orange

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
when I hold up the black 3 on the orange

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.120 
when I hold up the black 3 on the orange
background<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.260> I<00:06:18.320> think<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.620> message<00:06:18.800> is

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
background and I think the message is

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.320 
background and I think the message is
pretty<00:06:19.190> clear<00:06:19.460> for<00:06:20.060> it

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
pretty clear for it

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.450 
pretty clear for it
the<00:06:21.020> yellow<00:06:21.260> fever<00:06:21.530> fans<00:06:21.950> believe<00:06:22.430> that

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
the yellow fever fans believe that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.990 
the yellow fever fans believe that
Brisbane<00:06:23.150> are<00:06:23.450> indeed<00:06:23.810> about

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
Brisbane are indeed about

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000 
Brisbane are indeed about
on<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.210> trough<00:06:25.510> and<00:06:25.780> what<00:06:26.470> money<00:06:26.800> would

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
on the trough and what money would

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.879 
on the trough and what money would
you've<00:06:27.190> got<00:06:27.400> on<00:06:27.520> that<00:06:27.550> three<00:06:28.030> weeks<00:06:28.240> ago

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.569 

because<00:06:45.759> in<00:06:46.759> third<00:06:47.119> place<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:48.919> same<00:06:49.279> goal

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579 
because in third place the same goal

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.749 
because in third place the same goal
difference<00:06:50.379> as<00:06:51.379> the<00:06:51.649> Melbourne<00:06:52.009> Heart<00:06:52.219> who
