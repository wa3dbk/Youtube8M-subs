heirloom seeds are generally considered

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.369 
heirloom seeds are generally considered

old<00:00:15.880> most<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:17.150> them<00:00:17.300> are<00:00:17.420> much<00:00:17.630> older<00:00:17.870> than

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
old most of them are much older than

old most of them are much older than
that<00:00:18.440> they<00:00:18.920> can<00:00:19.160> be<00:00:19.369> hundreds<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:20.180> years<00:00:20.240> old

that they can be hundreds of years old

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.960 
that they can be hundreds of years old
and<00:00:21.520> their<00:00:22.520> seeds<00:00:22.910> that<00:00:23.740> are<00:00:24.740> still<00:00:25.730> around

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
and their seeds that are still around

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.570 
and their seeds that are still around
today<00:00:26.210> only<00:00:26.690> because<00:00:27.290> people<00:00:27.980> have<00:00:28.190> thrown

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
today only because people have thrown

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.760 
today only because people have thrown
them<00:00:28.790> out<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.210> saved<00:00:29.660> them<00:00:29.930> every<00:00:30.320> few<00:00:30.530> years

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
them out and saved them every few years

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.430 
them out and saved them every few years
pass<00:00:31.520> them<00:00:31.850> down<00:00:31.880> through<00:00:32.540> families<00:00:32.629> and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
pass them down through families and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.189 
pass them down through families and
through<00:00:33.620> generations<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:34.910> their<00:00:35.210> seats<00:00:35.510> that

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
through generations so their seats that

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.009 
through generations so their seats that
are<00:00:36.230> our<00:00:36.649> plants<00:00:37.280> from<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.550> past<00:00:37.789> right<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
are our plants from the past right so

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.439 
are our plants from the past right so
why<00:00:39.260> why<00:00:40.030> historically<00:00:41.030> had<00:00:41.300> they

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
why why historically had they

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.569 
why why historically had they
disappeared<00:00:42.399> well<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.760> couple<00:00:44.749> of<00:00:44.989> reasons

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
disappeared well a couple of reasons

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.439 
disappeared well a couple of reasons
first<00:00:46.579> of<00:00:46.760> all<00:00:47.109> gardening<00:00:48.109> is<00:00:48.440> as<00:00:49.449> susceptible

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
first of all gardening is as susceptible

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.579 
first of all gardening is as susceptible
to<00:00:50.870> fashion<00:00:51.350> as<00:00:51.609> fashion<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.690> many<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.379> them

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
to fashion as fashion and many of them

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.000 
to fashion as fashion and many of them
just<00:00:54.949> fell<00:00:55.280> out<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.489> flavor<00:00:55.850> because<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.050> the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
just fell out of flavor because the the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.610 
just fell out of flavor because the the
next<00:00:58.339> was<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.640> flavor<00:00:58.999> of<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.359> month<00:00:59.479> was<00:00:59.899> to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
next was the flavor of the month was to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.129 
next was the flavor of the month was to
have<00:01:00.710> something<00:01:01.010> big<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.120> bold<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.780> bigger

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
have something big and bold and bigger

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.310 
have something big and bold and bigger
flowers<00:01:03.469> etc<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:04.690> heirlooms<00:01:05.690> tended<00:01:06.170> to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
flowers etc and so heirlooms tended to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.340 
flowers etc and so heirlooms tended to
get<00:01:06.500> forgotten<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.490> put<00:01:07.790> aside<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.509> in<00:01:08.990> favor

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
get forgotten and put aside and in favor

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.770 
get forgotten and put aside and in favor
of<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.740> new<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:09.920> improved<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:11.270> that's<00:01:11.450> one<00:01:11.630> of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
of the new and improved so that's one of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.880 
of the new and improved so that's one of
the<00:01:11.869> reasons<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.070> other<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:14.180> as<00:01:14.890> seed

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
the reasons the other is that as seed

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.210 
the reasons the other is that as seed
companies<00:01:16.430> became

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.340 

subsumes<00:01:19.970> within<00:01:20.390> each<00:01:20.570> other<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:21.170> got

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
subsumes within each other and we got

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.470 
subsumes within each other and we got
larger<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:21.890> larger<00:01:22.130> seed<00:01:22.640> companies<00:01:23.180> but

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
larger and larger seed companies but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.420 
larger and larger seed companies but
fewer<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.020> fewer<00:01:24.230> of<00:01:24.470> them<00:01:24.650> we<00:01:24.980> lost<00:01:25.160> our

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
fewer and fewer of them we lost our

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.290 
fewer and fewer of them we lost our
small<00:01:25.790> regional<00:01:26.300> companies<00:01:26.920> large<00:01:27.920> companies

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
small regional companies large companies

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.120 
small regional companies large companies
are<00:01:29.300> interested<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.200> what<00:01:30.380> sells<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.950> most

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
are interested in what sells the most

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.090 
are interested in what sells the most
and<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.270> they<00:01:32.750> would<00:01:32.930> narrow<00:01:33.230> their<00:01:33.500> range<00:01:33.800> to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and so they would narrow their range to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.460 
and so they would narrow their range to
what<00:01:34.280> they<00:01:34.400> can<00:01:34.580> sell<00:01:34.790> lots<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:36.230> lot<00:01:36.440> of

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
what they can sell lots of and a lot of

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.130 
what they can sell lots of and a lot of
heirlooms<00:01:36.980> don't<00:01:37.460> sell<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> lot<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.480> so<00:01:38.930> they

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
heirlooms don't sell a lot and so they

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.500 
heirlooms don't sell a lot and so they
tend<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.470> get<00:01:39.620> dropped<00:01:40.010> I<00:01:40.400> guess<00:01:41.150> some<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
tend to get dropped I guess some of the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.660 
tend to get dropped I guess some of the
varietals<00:01:42.050> that<00:01:42.260> would<00:01:42.440> have<00:01:42.670> historically

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
varietals that would have historically

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.490 
varietals that would have historically
been<00:01:43.790> really<00:01:44.300> good<00:01:44.540> flavor<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.230> stuff<00:01:45.380> would

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
been really good flavor and stuff would

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.230 
been really good flavor and stuff would
necessarily<00:01:45.680> have<00:01:45.980> shipped<00:01:46.340> well<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:47.030> kind

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.110 
agriculture on a very large scale I
guess<00:02:19.250> some<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.490> them<00:02:19.670> thinking<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.030> things

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
brand of wonder are they look like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.120 
brand of wonder are they look like
tumors<00:02:24.080> tomato<00:02:24.620> right

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130

expectations of what vegetables look

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
expectations of what vegetables look
like<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.100> think<00:02:40.250> tomato<00:02:40.700> should<00:02:41.090> all<00:02:41.210> be

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
like so we think tomato should all be

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.660 
like so we think tomato should all be
red<00:02:41.570> around<00:02:41.900> carrot<00:02:42.830> should<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.190> along<00:02:43.490> an

red around carrot should be along an

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.270 
red around carrot should be along an
orange<00:02:43.970> cucumbers<00:02:44.810> should<00:02:44.990> be<00:02:45.110> green<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.590> in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
orange cucumbers should be green and in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.130 
orange cucumbers should be green and in

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
an actual fact the the vegetable world

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.100 
an actual fact the the vegetable world
used<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.490> diverse<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.420> that's<00:02:53.870> what

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
used to be so diverse and that's what

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.130 
used to be so diverse and that's what
heirlooms<00:02:54.500> still<00:02:54.830> give<00:02:55.040> us<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.810> get<00:02:56.990> all

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
heirlooms still give us and you get all

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.920 
heirlooms still give us and you get all
kinds<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.590> odd<00:02:57.740> shapes<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.490> sizes<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.540> colors

chuckles and that diversity is what

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.820 
chuckles and that diversity is what

again and modern hybrids have very

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
narrow genetic basis so we lose

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.860 
narrow genetic basis so we lose
heirlooms<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.820> lose<00:03:53.000> part<00:03:53.300> of<00:03:53.390> our<00:03:53.480> genetic

diversity<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.830> can't<00:03:55.100> get<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.430> back<00:03:55.640> so

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
diversity and you can't get that back so

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.570 
diversity and you can't get that back so
let's<00:03:56.570> talk<00:03:56.720> about<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.190> given<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.220> there

let's talk about that given that there

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.060 
let's talk about that given that there
is<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> decrease<00:03:59.270> in<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.930> varieties<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.860> seeds

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070

where do you get your seats how do you

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.440 
where do you get your seats how do you
manage

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
manage

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.070

keep<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.959> variety<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> going<00:04:04.890> well<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.900> a

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
keep the variety of going well I do a

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.140 
keep the variety of going well I do a
lot<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.349> research<00:04:07.860> over<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.550> winter<00:04:08.879> is<00:04:09.120> when

lot of research over the winter is when
I<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.629> my<00:04:09.959> research<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.860> what<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.610> do<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.239> go

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
I do my research and I what I do is I go

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.770 
I do my research and I what I do is I go
