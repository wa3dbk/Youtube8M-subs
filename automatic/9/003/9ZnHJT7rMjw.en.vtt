00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
can even do this on a computer connect

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.550 
can even do this on a computer connect
your<00:02:26.160> TV<00:02:26.580> which<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.209> cool<00:02:27.560> so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
your TV which would be really cool so

and then you have your do the same thing
do<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> same<00:02:33.810> thing<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.380> did<00:02:34.530> before

do the same thing of what you did before
so<00:02:35.610> 16<00:02:36.600> plan<00:02:36.750> beta<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:37.770> restart

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
so 16 plan beta and then it will restart

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.010 
so 16 plan beta and then it will restart
again<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.790> you're<00:02:38.910> signing<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.569> then<00:02:39.930> you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
again and so you're signing and then you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.850 
again and so you're signing and then you
just<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.380> your<00:02:40.500> library<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:42.739> then<00:02:43.739> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
just go to your library and then you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.180 
just go to your library and then you
stream<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.400> game<00:02:44.700> let's<00:02:45.150> try<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:46.830> all<00:02:47.010> of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
stream a game let's try now not all of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.520 
stream a game let's try now not all of
these<00:02:47.340> work<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.480> some<00:02:49.019> reason<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> sound

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
these work and for some reason the sound

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.100 
these work and for some reason the sound
isn't<00:02:49.769> work<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.610> there's<00:02:50.970> no<00:02:51.090> sound<00:02:51.390> yet<00:02:51.810> but

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
isn't work so there's no sound yet but

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.030 
isn't work so there's no sound yet but
this<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.380> beta<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.600> let's<00:02:54.600> try<00:02:54.930> let's<00:02:55.800> try<00:02:55.890> too

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this is beta so let's try let's try too

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.160 
this is beta so let's try let's try too
strong<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:56.730> let's<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.030> BioShock<00:02:57.840> Infinite

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.490 

alright<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.250> play<00:03:05.900> great<00:03:07.040> yes

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
alright so I'm on to play great yes

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.320 
alright so I'm on to play great yes
put<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.590> down<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> little<00:03:11.310> bit<00:03:11.459> wait<00:03:12.150> for

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
put this down and a little bit wait for

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.290 
put this down and a little bit wait for
it<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> load

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.690 

so<00:03:19.840> as<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.680> button<00:03:20.980> oh<00:03:21.190> it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so as you can see the button oh it

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:54.840 
so as you can see the button oh it
started<00:03:50.130> right<00:03:51.210> so<00:03:52.210> maybe<00:03:52.330> past<00:03:52.630> six<00:03:53.670> all<00:03:54.670> this

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
started right so maybe past six all this

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.040 
started right so maybe past six all this
information<00:03:55.450> about<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.840> hello<00:03:56.770> your<00:03:56.950> stream

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
information about your hello your stream

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.780 
information about your hello your stream
so<00:03:59.050> there's<00:03:59.230> my<00:03:59.440> resolution<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.430> all<00:04:00.580> that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
so there's my resolution and all that

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.740 
so there's my resolution and all that
and<00:04:01.180> then<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.630> graph<00:04:02.580> it's<00:04:03.580> kind<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:04.150> think

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and then a graph it's kind of I think

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.690 
and then a graph it's kind of I think
that's<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.080> latency<00:04:05.380> graph<00:04:05.770> I<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.160> no<00:04:06.400> medium

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
that's a latency graph I have no medium

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.840 
that's a latency graph I have no medium
sorry<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.510> up<00:04:07.660> which<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:09.190> not<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.460> good<00:04:09.670> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
sorry but up which it's not that good I

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.850 
sorry but up which it's not that good I
think

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
think

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.890 
think
so<00:04:11.860> let's<00:04:12.190> put<00:04:12.370> six<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:13.030> dawn<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.780> can

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
so let's put six in it dawn and you can

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.080 
so let's put six in it dawn and you can
play<00:04:14.050> your<00:04:14.170> games<00:04:15.299> Suites<00:04:16.299> less<00:04:17.670> so<00:04:18.670> I<00:04:18.880> didn't

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
play your games Suites less so I didn't

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.710 
play your games Suites less so I didn't
see<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.270> am<00:04:19.720> using<00:04:20.440> moving<00:04:20.860> the<00:04:21.160> mouse<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:22.600> it

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
see I am using moving the mouse and it

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.240 
see I am using moving the mouse and it
works<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:25.120> all<00:04:25.510> right<00:04:25.690> now<00:04:26.350> this<00:04:26.860> compare<00:04:27.160> of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
works so all right now this compare of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.920 
works so all right now this compare of
pennis<00:04:27.520> on<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:27.910> that's<00:04:28.000> I'm<00:04:28.210> not<00:04:28.240> according

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
pennis on so that's I'm not according

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.610 
pennis on so that's I'm not according
any<00:04:29.020> gameplay<00:04:29.290> straight<00:04:29.770> from<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:31.620> in

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
any gameplay straight from it and in

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.010 
any gameplay straight from it and in
this<00:04:32.770> lag<00:04:33.210> there<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.360> bit<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.720> latency<00:04:34.900> but

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
this lag there is a bit of latency but

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:55.830 
this lag there is a bit of latency but
just<00:04:38.020> try<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:55.060> was<00:04:55.150> really<00:04:55.420> interesting

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
just try this it was really interesting

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.300 
just try this it was really interesting
that<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:55.960> can<00:04:56.080> actually<00:04:56.260> stream<00:04:56.920> from<00:04:57.100> like

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
that you can actually stream from like

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
that you can actually stream from like
computer<00:04:57.730> which<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:58.590> waiting<00:04:59.590> back<00:04:59.800> there

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
computer which is waiting back there

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.210 
computer which is waiting back there
well<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:01.480> know<00:05:01.660> where<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.770> is

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
well you know where it is but this is

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.410 
well you know where it is but this is
not<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.640> same<00:05:03.790> thing<00:05:03.820> because<00:05:04.060> as<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.330> can

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
not the same thing because as you can

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
not the same thing because as you can
see<00:05:04.480> it's<00:05:05.470> pretty<00:05:05.590> sucky<00:05:07.290> wouldn't<00:05:08.290> be<00:05:08.350> able

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
see it's pretty sucky wouldn't be able

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:19.800 
see it's pretty sucky wouldn't be able
to<00:05:08.590> load<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.900> game<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:11.800> bow<00:05:11.950> shock<00:05:12.160> if<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:18.810> might

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
to load a game like bow shock if I might

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.070 
to load a game like bow shock if I might
speak

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
speak

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.940 
speak
