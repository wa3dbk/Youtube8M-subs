I'm<00:00:59.660> not<00:00:59.809> really<00:00:59.929> sure<00:01:00.109> why<00:01:00.350> oh<00:01:00.500> dear<00:01:00.710> throws

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
I'm not really sure why oh dear throws

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.919 
I'm not really sure why oh dear throws
rocks<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.640> air<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.300> but<00:01:02.539> that's<00:01:02.690> fine

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
rocks up in the air but but that's fine

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.620 
rocks up in the air but but that's fine
and<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:03.800> you'll<00:01:04.040> notice<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.550> minions<00:01:05.000> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
and if you'll notice the minions the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.360 
and if you'll notice the minions the
minions<00:01:06.050> are<00:01:06.170> very<00:01:06.500> well<00:01:06.710> detailed<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.310> this

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
minions are very well detailed in this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.530 
minions are very well detailed in this
version<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.730> guess<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:08.090> because<00:01:08.180> they<00:01:08.420> have

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
version I guess it's because they have

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.180 
version I guess it's because they have
the<00:01:08.660> time<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.960> do<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.110> because<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:09.410> in<00:01:09.530> 2d<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the time to do it because it's in 2d and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.250 
the time to do it because it's in 2d and
they'll<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.550> worry<00:01:10.730> about<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:11.330> it's

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
they'll have to worry about it but it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.960 
they'll have to worry about it but it's
a<00:01:12.350> very<00:01:12.500> very<00:01:12.830> well<00:01:13.280> done<00:01:13.460> game<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:13.760> think

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
a very very well done game I think

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.790 
a very very well done game I think
especially<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.750> something<00:01:15.440> that's<00:01:15.590> so

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
especially for something that's so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.320 
especially for something that's so
obscure<00:01:16.280> nobody<00:01:16.700> seems<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.940> have<00:01:17.060> heard<00:01:17.210> about

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
obscure nobody seems to have heard about

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.770 
obscure nobody seems to have heard about
not<00:01:18.170> really<00:01:18.260> sure<00:01:18.500> why<00:01:18.650> but<00:01:18.950> yeah<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.660> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
not really sure why but yeah and and you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.960 
not really sure why but yeah and and you
can<00:01:20.990> do<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.100> activate<00:01:22.490> they're<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:22.880> of

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
can do you can activate they're one of

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.310 
can do you can activate they're one of
who<00:01:23.060> dears<00:01:23.300> abilities<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.870> start<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.170> gain

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
who dears abilities you start to gain

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.530 
who dears abilities you start to gain
some<00:01:24.530> speed<00:01:24.770> with<00:01:24.980> that<00:01:25.010> very<00:01:25.820> nice<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:26.480> very

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
some speed with that very nice it's very

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.750 
some speed with that very nice it's very
short<00:01:26.960> though<00:01:27.050> it's<00:01:27.170> only<00:01:27.230> a<00:01:27.380> burst<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.890> guess

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
short though it's only a burst I guess

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.890 
short though it's only a burst I guess
they<00:01:28.880> wanna<00:01:29.060> didn't<00:01:29.420> want<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.600> make<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.780> to

they wanna didn't want to make it to

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.610 
they wanna didn't want to make it to
offer<00:01:30.080> 3d<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:31.780> you've<00:01:32.780> got<00:01:32.930> more<00:01:33.080> minions
