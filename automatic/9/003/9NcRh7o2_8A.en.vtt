00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
think mostly storm little Sonny and Wolf
I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> best<00:00:44.370> Christina<00:00:44.969> needs<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I think are the best Christina needs to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690 
I think are the best Christina needs to
be<00:00:45.510> updated<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.500> christina<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> little

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
be updated because christina is a little

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.180 
be updated because christina is a little
bit<00:00:47.910> lame<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.140> she<00:00:49.350> needs<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> updated<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
bit lame but she needs to be updated a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.139 
bit lame but she needs to be updated a
little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.000> update

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
