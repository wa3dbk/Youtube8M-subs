in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:02:24.440> more<00:02:24.740> talk<00:02:24.920> time<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:27.470> started<00:02:28.100> with

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
percent more talk time we started with

percent more talk time we started with
completely<00:02:29.570> opposing<00:02:29.990> goals<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.370> wanted

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
completely opposing goals and we wanted

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.000 
completely opposing goals and we wanted
to<00:02:31.700> make<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.030> iphone<00:02:32.540> more<00:02:33.170> capable<00:02:33.710> we

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
to make this iphone more capable we

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.580 
to make this iphone more capable we
wanted<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> add<00:02:34.520> more<00:02:34.790> feature<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.810> yet<00:02:36.470> at

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
wanted to add more feature and yet at

wanted to add more feature and yet at
the<00:02:36.650> same<00:02:36.710> time<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.610> wanted<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.910> make<00:02:38.030> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
the same time we wanted to make it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.870 
the same time we wanted to make it
smaller<00:02:38.390> an<00:02:38.840> even<00:02:39.110> thinner<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:40.550> lets<00:02:40.760> us

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
smaller an even thinner and that lets us

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.560 
smaller an even thinner and that lets us
some<00:02:41.090> really<00:02:41.390> surprising<00:02:41.690> innovation<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.450> we

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
some really surprising innovation and we

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.330 
some really surprising innovation and we
developed<00:02:44.720> an<00:02:45.110> entirely<00:02:45.650> new<00:02:45.830> grade

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
developed an entirely new grade

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.420 
developed an entirely new grade
stainless<00:02:47.000> steel<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:48.020> after<00:02:48.380> machining<00:02:48.770> is

incredibly<00:02:50.360> strong<00:02:50.750> but<00:02:51.590> also<00:02:51.800> remarkably

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
incredibly strong but also remarkably

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.960 
incredibly strong but also remarkably

precise the steel frame functions is the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.630 
precise the steel frame functions is the
antenna<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:56.810> also<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.620> primary<00:02:57.860> structure

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640

giving<00:02:59.180> us<00:02:59.390> more<00:02:59.600> internal<00:03:00.140> volume<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.840> also

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
giving us more internal volume we also

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.900 
giving us more internal volume we also
developed<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.680> custom<00:03:04.070> glass<00:03:04.250> that's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
developed a custom glass that's
