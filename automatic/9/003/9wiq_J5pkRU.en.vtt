after that well of course so happy for

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.150 
after that well of course so happy for
the<00:00:05.279> three<00:00:05.460> points<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.970> think<00:00:06.830> probably<00:00:07.830> today

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the three points I think probably today

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.220 
the three points I think probably today
one<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> tougher<00:00:08.849> came<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.870> they<00:00:10.019> say

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
one of the tougher came and they say

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.839 
one of the tougher came and they say
some<00:00:10.440> especially<00:00:10.830> because<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.460> know<00:00:11.610> how

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
some especially because we know how

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.089 
some especially because we know how
difficult<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:12.599> points<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.259> at

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
difficult to get points here at

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.080 
difficult to get points here at
Newcastle<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.660> play<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:17.730> way<00:00:17.880> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
Newcastle the play that the the way that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
Newcastle the play that the the way that
the<00:00:18.210> play<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:19.010> really<00:00:20.010> difficult<00:00:20.189> because

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the play is really difficult because

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.120 
the play is really difficult because
just<00:00:20.970> direct<00:00:21.750> balls<00:00:22.020> long<00:00:22.529> balls<00:00:22.800> into<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
just direct balls long balls into the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.330 
just direct balls long balls into the
box<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:24.029> need<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> defend<00:00:25.340> fighting

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
box and you just need to defend fighting

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.269 
box and you just need to defend fighting

this<00:00:44.160> today<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.879> every<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:45.480> away<00:00:45.870> from

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
this today well every game away from

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
this today well every game away from
home<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.829> difficult<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> Premiership

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
home is so difficult in the Premiership

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.740 
home is so difficult in the Premiership
and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.579> need<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> defend<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and then and you need to defend well I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
and then and you need to defend well I
think<00:00:52.230> today<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.920> great<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> team<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
think today was great for the team to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
think today was great for the team to
give<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> clean<00:00:54.600> sheet<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.890> were

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
give the clean sheet I think we were

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.110 
give the clean sheet I think we were
very<00:00:56.250> solid<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.000> back<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:59.039> you<00:01:00.030> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
very solid at the back and then you know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840 
very solid at the back and then you know
we<00:01:00.270> had<00:01:00.420> chances<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:02.250> finish<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.730> we

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we had chances and we finish sure we

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
we had chances and we finish sure we
kill<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.300> chess<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> end<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
about the game that when we play a home

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.399 
about the game that when we play a home
that<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.470> had<00:01:28.590> different<00:01:28.799> team<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:31.290> know

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that we had different team but you know

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
that we had different team but you know
today<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.100> show<00:01:32.579> again<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.180> even<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
today we show again that even if you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340 
today we show again that even if you
don't<00:01:34.079> play<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.590> best<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> important

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

to weaken and I think now we are in a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
to weaken and I think now we are in a
good<00:01:40.259> shape<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.640> need<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:42.000> keep
