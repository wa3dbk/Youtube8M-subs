this<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.390> cutting<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> controller

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this thing cutting out the controller

this thing cutting out the controller
about<00:01:31.860> triple<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.689> horse<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.200> power<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
about triple the horse the power the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.920 
about triple the horse the power the
power<00:01:35.100> output<00:01:35.780> don't<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.930> why<00:01:37.079> people<00:01:37.110> get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.270 

controller<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.410> expensive<00:01:42.800> not<00:01:43.730> necessary

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
controller it's expensive not necessary

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.370 
controller it's expensive not necessary
yep<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.270> top<00:01:47.960> speed<00:01:48.230> about<00:01:48.500> 40<00:01:50.380> cheap

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
yep so top speed about 40 cheap

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.080 
yep so top speed about 40 cheap
batteries<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.980> whole<00:01:52.100> setup<00:01:52.370> is<00:01:52.610> probably

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
batteries the whole setup is probably

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.780 
batteries the whole setup is probably
about<00:01:53.210> two<00:01:53.540> hundred<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.160> thirty<00:01:55.160> bucks<00:01:55.520> or

easy to put together just need a junkie
bike<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:09.080> found<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.530> one<00:02:09.619> out<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.010> woods

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
bike I found this one out in the woods

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.960 
bike I found this one out in the woods
totally<00:02:11.390> belong<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> hobo<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:13.250> had

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
totally belong to a hobo and then had

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.540 
totally belong to a hobo and then had
one<00:02:14.150> these<00:02:14.270> little<00:02:14.830> metal<00:02:15.830> things<00:02:16.220> they're

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
one these little metal things they're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.820 
one these little metal things they're
just<00:02:17.510> hooked<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.080> with<00:02:18.260> little<00:02:18.560> ties

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
just hooked it up with little ties

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.610 
just hooked it up with little ties
because<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.430> wrong<00:02:19.580> type<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
because it was the wrong type and it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.350 
because it was the wrong type and it
just<00:02:21.920> goes<00:02:22.070> around<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.640> then<00:02:22.820> hooks<00:02:23.180> down

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
just goes around and then hooks down

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.940 
just goes around and then hooks down
here<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.260> those<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.650> pretty<00:02:24.860> cheap

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
here you can get those are pretty cheap

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.880 
here you can get those are pretty cheap
I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:26.110> stick<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> bunch<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.440> batteries<00:02:27.770> on

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
I think stick a bunch of batteries on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.950 
I think stick a bunch of batteries on
top<00:02:28.100> rap<00:02:28.610> electrical<00:02:29.120> tape<00:02:29.300> around<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.690> so

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
top rap electrical tape around it so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.370 
top rap electrical tape around it so
that<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.520> fall<00:02:31.520> off<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.260> run<00:02:33.260> them

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
that they can fall off I run them

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.180 
that they can fall off I run them
straight<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.690> on/off<00:02:35.960> switch<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
straight to the little on/off switch and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.060 
straight to the little on/off switch and
then<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.090> go<00:02:38.270> really<00:02:38.600> fast<00:02:38.870> now<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.770> speed

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
then you go really fast now the speed

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.790 
then you go really fast now the speed
limits<00:02:40.400> technically<00:02:40.880> 20<00:02:41.390> miles<00:02:41.570> an<00:02:41.840> hour<00:02:41.990> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
limits technically 20 miles an hour you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.370 
limits technically 20 miles an hour you
know<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.550> consider<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.630> an<00:02:44.810> act<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.110> civil

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
know but I consider it an act of civil

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.650 
know but I consider it an act of civil
disobedience<00:02:45.580> not<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.760> follow<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.239> because

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
disobedience not to follow that because

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.740 
disobedience not to follow that because
it's<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.470> ridiculous<00:02:48.620> rule<00:02:49.810> yeah<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:52.750> we

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it's it's a ridiculous rule yeah and we

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.449 
it's it's a ridiculous rule yeah and we
have<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.050> be<00:02:54.200> using<00:02:54.530> whatever<00:02:54.709> alternative

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
have to be using whatever alternative

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.430 
have to be using whatever alternative
forms<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.090> transportation<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.200> these

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
forms of transportation we can these

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.010 
forms of transportation we can these
days<00:03:00.730> I'll<00:03:01.730> put<00:03:01.970> more<00:03:02.150> videos<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.600> later<00:03:02.810> where

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
days I'll put more videos on later where

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.540 
days I'll put more videos on later where
you<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.230> actually<00:03:03.380> see<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.860> go<00:03:04.070> really<00:03:04.280> fast

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you can actually see it go really fast

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.449 
you can actually see it go really fast
