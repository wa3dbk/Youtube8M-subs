more<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:28.909> an<00:01:29.030> actual<00:01:29.360> NASCAR<00:01:29.720> but

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
more like an actual NASCAR but

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.429 
more like an actual NASCAR but
nevertheless<00:01:30.799> still<00:01:31.700> pretty<00:01:32.030> cool<00:01:32.229> I'm<00:01:33.229> not

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
nevertheless still pretty cool I'm not

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.499 
nevertheless still pretty cool I'm not
that<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.220> know<00:01:34.340> excited<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:35.329> these

that you know excited about these

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.899 
that you know excited about these
vehicles<00:01:35.840> like<00:01:36.170> other<00:01:36.380> people<00:01:36.770> are<00:01:36.950> just

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
vehicles like other people are just

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.399 
vehicles like other people are just
because<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.270> feel<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.570> we're<00:01:39.079> getting<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
because I feel like we're getting the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.109 
because I feel like we're getting the
same<00:01:39.680> vehicle<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.340> we've<00:01:40.460> already<00:01:40.610> had<00:01:40.909> with

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
same vehicle that we've already had with

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.210 
same vehicle that we've already had with
them<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.360> soccer<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.530> other<00:01:42.799> than<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.070> I

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
them a soccer but other than that I

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.800

change<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.930> color<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.159> primary<00:01:55.430> which

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
change the color of the primary which

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.330 
change the color of the primary which
will<00:01:56.420> be<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.810> base<00:01:57.229> color<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.799> your<00:01:57.890> vehicle

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
will be the base color of your vehicle

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340 
will be the base color of your vehicle
so<00:01:58.850> as<00:01:58.969> you<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.180> tell<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.750> orange<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.320> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
so as you can tell the orange is the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.380 
so as you can tell the orange is the
only<00:02:00.619> color<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.189> can<00:02:01.340> change<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.180> can't

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
only color you can change you can't

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.170 
only color you can change you can't
change<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
change the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.970 
change the
I<00:02:04.540> guess<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.080> stickers<00:02:05.440> are<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.680> paint

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
I guess the stickers are the paint

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.430 
I guess the stickers are the paint
that's<00:02:06.550> on<00:02:06.700> there<00:02:07.150> but<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.480> can<00:02:07.660> change<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
that's on there but you can change the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.469 
that's on there but you can change the
primary<00:02:09.039> color<00:02:09.369> which<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.910> orange<00:02:10.240> one<00:02:10.390> as

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
primary color which is the orange one as

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.120 
primary color which is the orange one as
you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:10.960> right<00:02:10.990> there<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.560> end<00:02:12.040> up

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
you can see right there I end up

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
you can see right there I end up
changing<00:02:12.400> colors<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.120> kind<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.360> see<00:02:13.540> what

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
changing colors just to kind of see what

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.020 
changing colors just to kind of see what
would<00:02:13.900> look<00:02:14.050> best<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.650> end<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.400> going<00:02:15.700> back<00:02:15.730> to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
would look best I end up going back to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.070 
would look best I end up going back to
the<00:02:16.120> orange<00:02:16.450> because<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> orange

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the orange because I think the orange

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.420 
the orange because I think the orange
really<00:02:17.470> makes<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.740> pop<00:02:17.800> really<00:02:18.220> nicely

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
really makes it pop really nicely

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.550 
really makes it pop really nicely
especially<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> yellow<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:19.990> then<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
especially with the yellow and then the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.710 
especially with the yellow and then the
white<00:02:20.740> right<00:02:20.980> there<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:22.390> guys<00:02:22.480> can

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
white right there but you guys can

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.150 
white right there but you guys can
change<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.140> any<00:02:23.290> single<00:02:23.620> color<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.950> like

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
change it to any single color you like

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.330 
change it to any single color you like
and<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.870> secondary<00:02:26.320> color<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.070> change

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and the secondary color you can change

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.470 
and the secondary color you can change
that<00:02:27.490> as<00:02:27.610> well<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:27.910> whatever<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.300> like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
didn't really see much of a change

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.730 
didn't really see much of a change
really<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:30.870> overall<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.140> know<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.380> guys<00:02:32.500> can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
really but overall you know you guys can

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.350 
really but overall you know you guys can
make<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.130> whatever<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.760> prefer<00:02:33.910> I'm<00:02:34.209> not

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
too sure you know what more you can

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.240 
too sure you know what more you can
really<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.230> vehicle<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.890> because

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
really do to this vehicle just because

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.550 
really do to this vehicle just because
there<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.850> isn't<00:02:40.360> all<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.690> much<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.470> a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
there really isn't all that much of a

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.350 
there really isn't all that much of a
difference<00:02:41.590> than<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.550> with<00:02:42.760> any<00:02:43.270> other

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
difference than you would with any other

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.260 
difference than you would with any other
vehicle<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.290> wanted<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.860> keep<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.160> race<00:02:45.400> kind<00:02:46.090> of

stuff I didn't add the turbo just

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.360
