00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
there's a new lock there which you've

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.260 
there's a new lock there which you've
completed<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> photos<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.280> there's

completed the photos and then there's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.639 
completed the photos and then there's
also<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> spot<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.290> side<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
also an in the spot on the other side of

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.240 
also an in the spot on the other side of
the<00:01:43.710> park<00:01:44.299> but<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:46.200> alright<00:01:46.799> area<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the park but it's an alright area I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
the park but it's an alright area I
guess<00:01:47.549> um<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.409> Vegas

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
guess um just not to Vegas

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.130 
guess um just not to Vegas
I<00:01:53.299> reckon<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.659> made<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
I reckon they should have made it so you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
I reckon they should have made it so you
can<00:01:55.350> create<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> park<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.939> they

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
can create a park in here there but they

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
can create a park in here there but they
didn't<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.899> sucks

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
didn't so that sucks

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
didn't so that sucks
but<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.430> again<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.790> only<00:01:59.909> paid<00:02:00.149> four<00:02:00.329> quid

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
but then again we only paid four quid

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.709 
but then again we only paid four quid
for<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> lot<00:02:01.890> bad<00:02:02.180> about<00:02:03.180> again

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
for this it's not a lot bad about again
