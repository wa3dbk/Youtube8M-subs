 mega fi megapixel is the door 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.549

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's go pack contents 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 here it is quality you have seen the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.369
 package follows a bit of everyone's 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 the other samsung devices that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 we have seen recently therefore in cardboard 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 in recycled cardboard 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 We have this action box 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.369
 inside the box it contains 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.619
 all the accessories then the usb cable 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 micro usb 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.850
 the power supply and these manuals is missing 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.039
 even with samsung exclusive one is missing 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.030
 fighter icolari even though now in the 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.130
 We really don't hope for tablets anymore 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 this is our tab 3 we approach 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
 a bit the design is really very much 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.729
 similar to everything in everything 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.460
 the other samsung family obviously are 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.710
 of the various galaxy s 4 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.719
 we have a central physical key then 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.990
 it is assumed that the use is in 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.270
 this towards menu key and back key e 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.970
 instead they are touch keys 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.100
 we have here on the infrared side that 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.270
 here there is a little we say makes us doubt 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.550
 of the direction in which we should use 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.550
 tablet volume rocker button 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
 ignition over a contribution I was looking for 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.890
 of the iii and a half on the left side 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.570
 we have the sim slot for the micro 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.750
 sim to be precise is that for the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.860
 micro sd below we have a double speaker 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.370
 the micro usb port 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.190
 behind we have the camera that has or 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.750
 autofocus but not led flash it 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.820
 let's turn on but we won't go any further 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.890
 the ignition because as usual the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.530
 review will come later in the next 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.330
 days have on our forum 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 androidworld.it slash forum to make us 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.950

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.080
