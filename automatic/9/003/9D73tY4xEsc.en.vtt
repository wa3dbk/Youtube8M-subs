00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.609
 scientists point to a global effect when man is his own wolf 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.470
 men 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.809
 chics just did not say yes 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 You know this statement of nature. 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.570
 aggressions that sometimes arrive discreetly by the sea the guests to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.370
 participate in the challenges 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.520
 along with water put the ball to maintain the waterways when they are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.550
 downloaded 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.770
 this professor of the federal university of alagoas to research the effects of 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.720
 ballast water from ships traveling the continents 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.330
 Exchanging organic physiotherapy materials has animal species and 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.570
 they are very dangerous and transfers 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the place of the world to another 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.530
 this psd 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the difficult hours to work 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 Brazil sign an international agreement 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.020
 two sides because of the exchange of ballast water 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.570
 from one country to another if year to year there are species that people places 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.120
 where there are no natural predators 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.330
 this imbalance caused by these invasive species is already attacking 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.240
 Brazilian coast and even gravely baking the corals in the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 specialty on both feet 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.920
 would have occurred 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.990
 here at the Brazilian base, thus creating great losses 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.660
 I do not play in morumbi ball 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.110
 who has been registered for many years since 2002 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.710
 in the base of sao paulo 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.510
 that is appearing here in the parça goals 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.340
 and I love this real problem for next year 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 due to the asphalt lethal began to occur on the coast of Rio de Janeiro and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590
 são paulo mainly from the bay of the big island 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.240
 but unfortunately to have existed on the part of the navy 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.040
 in the bay of all saints 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.670
 close to salvador 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.050
 and is still very strong working platforms 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 in the sergipe coastal region of sergipe already thought about it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420
 and I will not be too dangerous 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 why is the rate of very fast growth not going to stop in the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.720
 newspapers 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.720
 ae like the one here who love similar art 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.889
 that the growth rate is very large then to encourage given the year 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.749
 it is a kind of 5 6 and 7 is the ten million and a half years and has more 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:17.790
 three people 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.209
 he was in the Brazilian base 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.260
 then it was not if at some point this picture 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.309
 just know 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.469
 I will run 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.309
 in these six years of reef the environmental impact will be very large 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.329
 in Turkey because it grows very rapidly 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 and even eliminates 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.359
 - for this
