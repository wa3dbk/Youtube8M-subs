00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.290

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:50.959
 I think it's like to lose her to 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.029

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.289
 the two times that we have left to the 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.569
 first pulling epic you know you can 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.429
 really be like to be the 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.829
 exactly audio jams and that's when 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.629
 I will catch you and pulling on the last 

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:20.529
 second they grab you money that can not 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.529
 happen from what I say 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.920
 let's go up 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.590
 it's not worth four of four 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.790
 mates now I have the time 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.680
 first you get caught the next 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:42.190
 I take you back through the first but 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 nor do you doubt listen listen once you 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.370
 you're going to stop and you're not sure 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.370
 very safe 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.970
 what's up, I have everything right now 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.889
 super perfect for rubÃ©n to become a 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:05.949
 effect let's go the protectors those are worth 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.090
 perfect and come to the second one a game 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:11.919
 that the door opens and all of the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.659
 partner had not subscribed until the 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.110
 look for electricity I'm going to 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.030
 do now 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.500
 that because your partner that was there 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.830
 he did not trust you you know he does not like how 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.830
 he drives 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.870
 I now that you will be caught by what 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.180
 less twice for more 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.430
 for now trimmed three seconds well 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.430
 I have 39 left 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.180
 okay, okay, perfect, perfect 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.550
 perfect 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.150
 A bird has passed below me when 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.150
 I was in the air 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.610
 let's go to a point but below 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.169
 uncles environment before the creative cigars 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.000
 wait at the goal but just when 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.389
 he saved himself and put you inside the goal 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.389
 so 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.250
 what do I have here 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:09.020
 to see to see you can actually avoid it 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:12.099
 and it is not 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.099
 doing a way 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:24.770
 entry 15 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:27.220
 my mother that hope has reigned in 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.220
 this race
