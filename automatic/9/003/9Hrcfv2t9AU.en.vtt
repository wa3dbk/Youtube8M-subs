00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.610
 I do not think she was formed decided again in the scheme of the arts they did not 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 have 23 pairs of chromosomes each of these states is formed with promotion 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.129
 of sale in the neighborhood pinheirinho that comes from the mother according to the bei only 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.109
 where each part and the spermatozoon also 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 and consequently in the offices do not want only a call to the author 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.409
 unique tick sound 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.179
 her identity 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 the promoters of the male gaeco spin the film 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.740
 the plot of the female gamete 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.710
 means that it is a must in 46 chromosomes in guadalcanal number of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.660
 parecis chromosomes 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.180
 me too 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.050
 a pistol has 46 chromosomes 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 already the chairs how much on August 23 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 and now 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.960
 as I was born there with 46 chromosomes can originate from the law of sa with 23 that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.730
 I like 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.070
 the answer to this doubt is the best 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.300
 better crosses this parcel to be divided in the origin to four new cells 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.840
 each with half the number of chromosomes in the police cell 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.810
 now pay close attention 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.650
 despite the improvements 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.890
 in a process of cell division as we are seeing 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 notification actually occurs 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 number of cells 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.480
 is that this huge cell division arose because of observations 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 microscopic 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 where one sees a jungle being divided in half to give rise to two new 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 cells 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.740
 the half-soprano process that occurs with all the how we are of the cell to the same 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.410
 time 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.990
 only to answer the dodo's question how the baby's sex is determined 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.300
 let's consider only one pair of sex chromosomes 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 and for this they will know a little more about them 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.250
 the homologous chromosomes are the same and have the same 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.500
 features 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.330
 sex chromosomes, despite being homologous, present some 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.019
 particularities 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.389
 there is a part of the chromosome that is what has the same genes as the 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.680
 However, there is a part of the xo chromosome that is different from the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.909
 chromosome and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.219
 consequently x emÃ­dio does not have the same appearance as it happens with 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.239
 other pairs of homologous chromosomes 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.149
 the function of half an hour without rafael aidar ney these 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.429
 she did not occur now she told 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.429
 only in ovary and testis cells 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.809
 drop 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.069
 help me I'm crazy 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.039
 important data more important than this 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.039
 With all that 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:04.029
 these pieces will be very important for us to continue studying and hours 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.510
 here we have a pair of sex chromosomes now let's imagine that there are 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.779
 inside a testicle cell that is prepared to enter into 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:13.509
 division 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.339
 genetic material of each party member said dutra and each member of the pair 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.259
 of homologous chromosomes is directed to one end of the jungle 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.859
 in the following week 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.559
 giving rise to two cells each containing one of the members of parliament 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.739
 pulling a duplicate chromosome 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.230
 one on each side we see that each of the cells that has been formed has only 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.079
 when the brown members of a dead 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.079
 the ibonic tico on this side and the x 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.279
 only that the genetic material continues to double 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.359
 pulling again 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.669
 we will see that the point of union between the two portions of bites of 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.849
 each x chromosome 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.389
 no space 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.849
 and then a new cell division occurred giving 4 cells 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.019
 you can observe here in my store there are two cell divisions 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:06.750
 in the first 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.429
 become two cells 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.559
 and at the end of the second four cells are formed 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.309
 he really wore 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.719
 here half pink extermination 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.249
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:26.069
 the best defined and the masculine are similar to the only difference 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.979
 is that women informed of his death 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.249
 for that to him 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.099
 in the half hour female have sealed let merkel while only one way 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.559
 crazy 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.449
 and beyond that 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.800
 the woman has only 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.699
 of the sex chromosome type 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.180
 the x chromosome 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.140
 while man formed net types of x and type i edition 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:52.949
 a lot 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.360
 understanding 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 which ones are they 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.419
 I only know that I can render 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.839
 his enemy he has only two types of milk 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.139
 the back of a truck 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.139
 also combines two types of income 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.639
 putting together everything he has already seen you can already answer that question 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.050
 as you already knew in the second session of the male trial that you join a 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.550
 game series of sex determination will depend on this ambulance 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.620
 the sex chromosome carried by too much sperm on the chromosome 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.350
 sexual charged for a year nonconformed pair of chromosomes 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.509
 sexy bbb 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.659
 who can be arrested xix petistas pio x 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.220
 so this new service by fertilized by a sperm cell tis 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.210
 formed cerrado says xix 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.150
 and obeyed the female sector 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.559
 already simone rosires was fertilized by a spermatozoa icsi others 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:56.789
 the formed cell will be difficult June 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.919
 milk will be male that sink 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.830
 the bed net surfer are the sexual of the law of the aunt lucia extinction that 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.969
 same 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.699
 You know what 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.449
 who determines the sex of the baby by extending the father's goal 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.910
 why look at the mother talking about the type of food chics 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.810
 so we're looking for the mother's storm will always be civilians 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.119
 already in the father's case 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:26.189
 the sperm can be both in chisinau and at evenings 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.909
 I finished my lesson 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.909
 since it is promoted or reversed 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.479
 It is better to have a revised 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.680
 thought similar to mealtime 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.570
 Today's material you have seen that the sex chromosomes are 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.589
 responsible for determining the sex of individuals 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.969
 you have seen that the sex chromosomes of the man who are hostile the minister 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.969
 whereas the woman has two x chromosomes 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.949
 saw that the planets the Swiss is one of the members of the pair of sex chromosomes 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.599
 because of the meiosis process 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.319
 and saw that it is the father's gametes that determine the sex of the baby 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.149
 just one more thing 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:14.899
 the immense sex chromosomes that we studied on the screen today do not 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.499
 has nothing to do with sexual preferences 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:21.839
 all homosexual or heterosexual men have chromosomes xix 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.649
 that this 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:27.869
 and all women with homosexuals or heterosexuals having chromosomes xix 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:30.439
 good studies 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.129
 see you next time
