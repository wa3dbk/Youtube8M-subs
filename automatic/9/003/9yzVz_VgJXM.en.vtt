uploaded<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.660> actually<00:02:41.930> take<00:02:42.320> a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
uploaded this is if you actually take a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.110 
uploaded this is if you actually take a
look<00:02:42.590> at<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.770> colors<00:02:43.130> they're<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.490> lot<00:02:43.700> like

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
look at the colors they're a lot like

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.520 
look at the colors they're a lot like
more<00:02:45.080> colorful<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.880> increase<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.170> saturation

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
more colorful I increase the saturation

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.980 
more colorful I increase the saturation
i<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.670> was<00:02:49.850> contrast<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.960> saturation

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
i think it was contrast and saturation

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.640 
i think it was contrast and saturation
or<00:02:51.920> something<00:02:52.580> ok<00:02:53.420> i<00:02:53.450> imitate<00:02:53.960> marks<00:02:54.500> like

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
or something ok i imitate marks like

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.440 
or something ok i imitate marks like
this<00:02:54.680> i'm<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:55.160> good<00:02:55.370> close<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.000> i<00:02:56.210> just
