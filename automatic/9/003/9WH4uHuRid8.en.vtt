00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.050 

ok<00:01:29.330> let's<00:01:29.630> open<00:01:29.920> nicely<00:01:30.920> packed<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:34.790> what<00:01:34.940> we

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
ok let's open nicely packed so what we

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.980 
ok let's open nicely packed so what we
having<00:01:35.240> here<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:38.420> let's<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.720> what<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.960> have

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
having here so let's see what we have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.830 
having here so let's see what we have
here<00:01:39.520> don't<00:01:40.520> know<00:01:40.730> what<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.030> table<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.570> we're

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
here don't know what this table is we're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.680 
here don't know what this table is we're
going<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.200> find<00:01:42.380> out<00:01:43.570> AC<00:01:44.570> adapter<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.040> go

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
going to find out AC adapter there we go

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.220 
going to find out AC adapter there we go
the<00:01:47.690> other<00:01:47.810> part<00:01:48.880> we<00:01:49.880> have<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.620> SATA<00:01:51.620> cable<00:01:54.970> USB

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
the other part we have a SATA cable USB

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:06.720 
the other part we have a SATA cable USB
cable<00:01:58.120> USB<00:01:59.120> cable<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:04.700> have<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> firewire<00:02:05.630> cable

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
cable USB cable we have a firewire cable

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.040 
cable USB cable we have a firewire cable
and<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.890> guess<00:02:10.130> these<00:02:11.030> are<00:02:11.090> holders<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
and I guess these are holders for the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.870 
and I guess these are holders for the
hard<00:02:12.710> drive<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> find<00:02:14.210> out<00:02:15.880> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
hard drive just going to find out that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.850 
hard drive just going to find out that
quick<00:02:17.210> start<00:02:17.510> guide<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> guess<00:02:17.960> and
