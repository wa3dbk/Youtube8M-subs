bit<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:59.660> batteries<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.560> 30<00:05:01.310> batteries<00:05:01.820> that

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
bit the batteries the 30 batteries that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.330 
bit the batteries the 30 batteries that
are<00:05:02.060> behind<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.630> rear<00:05:02.840> seat<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.440> then

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
are behind the rear seat and then

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.550 
are behind the rear seat and then
there's<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.820> charger<00:05:05.300> tucked<00:05:05.870> off<00:05:06.050> into<00:05:06.440> the

side

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930 

I'll<00:05:10.930> now<00:05:11.230> closed<00:05:11.830> with<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.220> couple<00:05:12.640> still

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
I'll now closed with a couple still

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.540

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
to get a good shot over all the cars

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.380 
to get a good shot over all the cars
performing<00:05:38.350> very<00:05:38.620> well<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:39.760> only<00:05:39.880> thing<00:05:40.030> I

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
performing very well the only thing I

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.180 
performing very well the only thing I
would<00:05:40.600> do<00:05:40.750> different<00:05:41.260> if<00:05:41.350> I<00:05:41.470> had<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.800> over<00:05:41.950> to

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
would do different if I had it over to

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.750 
would do different if I had it over to
do<00:05:42.340> again<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.600> 90<00:05:43.990> amp<00:05:44.140> our<00:05:44.380> cells<00:05:44.860> have<00:05:45.460> to

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
do again is the 90 amp our cells have to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.610 
do again is the 90 amp our cells have to
grade<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.180> a<00:05:46.270> voltage<00:05:46.690> sag<00:05:46.990> under<00:05:47.380> hard
