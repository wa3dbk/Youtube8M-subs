been made with independent watchmaker

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.150 
been made with independent watchmaker
Ludovic<00:00:28.920> Valois<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.060> watch<00:00:30.359> shows<00:00:31.109> time<00:00:31.740> in

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
Ludovic Valois this watch shows time in

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
Ludovic Valois this watch shows time in
a<00:00:32.279> different<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.880> original<00:00:33.000> way<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:34.230> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a different and original way where you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
a different and original way where you
would<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.520> minute<00:00:36.239> hands<00:00:36.630> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
would have actually the minute hands on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.979 
would have actually the minute hands on
the<00:00:37.290> outsides<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.550> dial<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.329> they're

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the outsides of the dial and they're

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.369 
the outsides of the dial and they're
like<00:00:40.230> small<00:00:40.710> needles<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> pop<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:43.050> after

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
like small needles that pop up one after

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
like small needles that pop up one after
the<00:00:43.500> other<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.370> each<00:00:44.640> minute<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.360> have

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the other so each minute you will have

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.389 
the other so each minute you will have
just<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.899> Holmes<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> jumping<00:00:47.100> minute

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
just like Holmes like a jumping minute

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
just like Holmes like a jumping minute
actually<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> center<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
actually and in the center you have the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.150 
actually and in the center you have the
display<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> hours<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.230> system

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
display of the hours and for this system

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
display of the hours and for this system
it's<00:00:53.460> very<00:00:53.579> complex

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it's very complex

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's very complex
it<00:00:55.350> required<00:00:56.300> 242<00:00:57.300> jurors<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> those

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it required 242 jurors to make it those

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
it required 242 jurors to make it those
are<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.390> functional<00:01:01.020> jewels<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
are really functional jewels to make it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
are really functional jewels to make it
work<00:01:02.100> overall<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.149> watch<00:01:03.539> movement<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.439> made

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
work overall this watch movement is made

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.780 
work overall this watch movement is made
up<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.840> 560<00:01:06.840> components<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.159> despite<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
up of 560 components but despite the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.469 
up of 560 components but despite the
complexity

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
complexity

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.230 
complexity
it's<00:01:09.780> an<00:01:10.080> ultra-thin<00:01:10.650> movement<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.760> case<00:01:12.000> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it's an ultra-thin movement the case is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620 
it's an ultra-thin movement the case is
made<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> white<00:01:13.140> gold<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.330> as<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.509> can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
made out of white gold and as you can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.920 
made out of white gold and as you can
see<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.830> movement<00:01:17.310> looks<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.450> much<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
see the movement looks there much like a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380 
see the movement looks there much like a
traditional<00:01:19.380> watch<00:01:20.369> movement<00:01:20.880> made<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
traditional watch movement made out of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.410 
traditional watch movement made out of
brass<00:01:21.659> without<00:01:22.200> any<00:01:22.580> complex<00:01:23.580> finishing<00:01:24.240> like

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
brass without any complex finishing like

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
brass without any complex finishing like
good<00:01:24.659> there's<00:01:24.840> nothing<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
good there's nothing like that it really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819 
good there's nothing like that it really
is<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> tribute<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.869> traditional<00:01:28.530> or

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is kind of a tribute to traditional or

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.270 
is kind of a tribute to traditional or
ology<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.970> some<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> opus<00:01:30.780> watches<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
ology with some of the opus watches they

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.120 
ology with some of the opus watches they
were<00:01:32.340> quite<00:01:32.700> extravagant<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.750> sometimes<00:01:34.170> for

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
were quite extravagant and sometimes for

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
were quite extravagant and sometimes for
some<00:01:35.310> people<00:01:35.670> may<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.909> difficult<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> wear<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
some people may be difficult to wear but

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.350 
some people may be difficult to wear but
this<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.579> wearable

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this one is actually very much wearable

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.600 
this one is actually very much wearable
it's<00:01:39.600> looks<00:01:40.170> almost<00:01:40.650> classic<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it's looks almost classic if you see it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's looks almost classic if you see it
from<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> certain<00:01:42.180> distance<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> course<00:01:43.409> as

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
from a certain distance but of course as

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
from a certain distance but of course as
soon<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.700> strange<00:01:45.090> dial

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
soon as you will see this strange dial

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
soon as you will see this strange dial
and<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> something<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and you will see that something is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
and you will see that something is
completely<00:01:47.790> different<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.570> such<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> watch

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
completely different with such a watch

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.800 
completely different with such a watch
with<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.770> single<00:01:50.189> crown<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.360> activate

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
with this single crown you activate

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
with this single crown you activate
actually<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> function<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> watch

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
actually all the function of the watch

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually all the function of the watch
it's<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.079> directly<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.890> three<00:01:56.130> o'clock<00:01:56.310> like

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it's not directly at three o'clock like

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
it's not directly at three o'clock like
the<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.180> used<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the way we're used to because of the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
the way we're used to because of the
complexity<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.250> parts<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.579> are<00:01:59.759> inside

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
complexity of the parts that are inside

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.310 
complexity of the parts that are inside
so<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.619> bit<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.399> two<00:02:02.729> ish

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
so it's a little bit more at the two ish

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.630 
so it's a little bit more at the two ish
position<00:02:04.320> another<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.340> special

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
position another thing there is special

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.459 
position another thing there is special
with<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.090> watch<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:06.990> display

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
with this watch is that it will display

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.680 
with this watch is that it will display
the<00:02:08.190> Harry<00:02:08.520> Winston<00:02:09.030> logo

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the Harry Winston logo

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.950 
the Harry Winston logo
on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.440> hour<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:11.040> midnight<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.120> midday<00:02:12.450> in

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
on the hour of midnight and midday in
