00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
thing we want to do is to heat this up a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
thing we want to do is to heat this up a
little<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.329> room<00:00:39.660> temperature<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.710> how

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
little bit of a room temperature and how

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
little bit of a room temperature and how
we're<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:42.570> be

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
we're going to do that is they could be

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.069 
we're going to do that is they could be
the<00:00:43.200> iron<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.489> lightly<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the iron and just lightly one with the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.979 
the iron and just lightly one with the
back<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:47.039> we're<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> place<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
back then we're going to place it at I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
back then we're going to place it at I
protector<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> once<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
protector and once we have it in the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
protector and once we have it in the
right<00:00:50.610> position<00:00:51.090> we'll<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.690> apply<00:00:52.110> some

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
right position we'll just apply some

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250 
right position we'll just apply some
more<00:00:52.770> pressure<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> we'll<00:00:54.510> move<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> 24

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
more pressure and we'll move it a 24

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.979 
more pressure and we'll move it a 24
hours<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.850> fully<00:00:57.030> adhere<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
hours so that they can fully adhere to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.520 
hours so that they can fully adhere to
the<00:00:58.109> light

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.220 

so<00:01:04.400> as<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.760> see<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:05.510> have<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.990> nice<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
so as you can see we have it nice and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.690 
so as you can see we have it nice and
toasty<00:01:06.890> not<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.970> hospital<00:01:08.690> burn<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:10.280> tell<00:01:10.580> us

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
toasty not to hospital burn you tell us

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.210 
toasty not to hospital burn you tell us
a<00:01:10.790> little<00:01:11.060> bit<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.390> curl<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.320> form<00:01:13.100> of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
a little bit of curl so it's a form of

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.950 
a little bit of curl so it's a form of
the<00:01:13.310> room<00:01:13.490> temperature<00:01:14.000> what<00:01:14.720> I'm<00:01:14.810> going<00:01:14.930> to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
do now is to peel the top a little bit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.830 
do now is to peel the top a little bit
and<00:01:19.160> I'm<00:01:19.310> going<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.520> place<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.990> top<00:01:21.410> where<00:01:22.160> I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
and I'm going to place the top where I

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.719 
and I'm going to place the top where I
want<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.500> tank<00:01:26.380> okay<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.040> what<00:01:28.460> I'm<00:01:28.580> you

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729

want it on the tank okay so what I'm you
doing<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.330> using<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.869> top<00:01:30.290> two<00:01:30.590> corners<00:01:31.010> here

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
doing is using the top two corners here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.850 
doing is using the top two corners here
to<00:01:32.150> measure<00:01:32.360> out<00:01:32.600> where<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.110> middle<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
to measure out where the middle of the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.130 
to measure out where the middle of the
tank<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:35.479> I'm<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:35.720> going<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.869> lightly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
tank is and so I'm just going to lightly

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
I'm going to go from top to bottom and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.030 
I'm going to go from top to bottom and
push<00:01:42.649> out<00:01:42.860> all<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.160> bubbles

to<00:02:33.800> give<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.370> lot<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.640> bubbles

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.170 

so<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.250> how<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.430> final<00:02:45.670> product<00:02:46.150> looks

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so this is how the final product looks

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.470 
so this is how the final product looks
not<00:02:47.170> too<00:02:47.380> shabby<00:02:47.620> all<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.550> air<00:02:48.970> bubbles<00:02:49.000> have

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
not too shabby all the air bubbles have

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.910 
not too shabby all the air bubbles have
been<00:02:49.600> pushed<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.990> we're<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.740> going<00:02:50.860> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
been pushed out we're just going to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.390 
been pushed out we're just going to
leave<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.450> overnight<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.350> safe<00:02:53.590> I'm

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
leave this overnight just to be safe I'm

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.850 
leave this overnight just to be safe I'm
pretty<00:02:54.610> sure<00:02:54.819> it's<00:02:55.150> mainly<00:02:55.630> used<00:02:55.840> but<00:02:56.380> since

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
pretty sure it's mainly used but since

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.740 
pretty sure it's mainly used but since
the<00:02:57.010> instruction<00:02:57.459> said<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.880> that's<00:02:58.480> what

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the instruction said so that's what

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.770 
the instruction said so that's what
we're<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.020> do<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.540> for<00:03:04.690> this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
we're going to do that's it for this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.270 
we're going to do that's it for this
time<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.380> our<00:03:05.530> first<00:03:05.800> afterword
