the Gribble and make a twin gate

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.249 
the Gribble and make a twin gate
carabiner<00:00:05.339> which<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.480> fairly<00:00:06.930> interesting

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
carabiner which is a fairly interesting

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.860 
carabiner which is a fairly interesting
new<00:00:07.589> product<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.730> idea<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.179> having<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.630> twin

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
new product the idea of having a twin

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.169 
new product the idea of having a twin
gate<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.290> not<00:00:10.469> new<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.759> hasn't<00:00:12.000> really

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
gate is not new but there hasn't really

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.359 
gate is not new but there hasn't really
been<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:13.200> widely<00:00:14.040> commercially<00:00:14.730> available

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
been a widely commercially available

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
been a widely commercially available
flip-flop<00:00:17.369> until<00:00:17.789> now<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.720> we're<00:00:19.350> gonna<00:00:19.439> go

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
flip-flop until now so we're gonna go

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.960 
flip-flop until now so we're gonna go
through<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> specs<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> then<00:00:20.699> tell

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
through some of the specs and then tell

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
through some of the specs and then tell
you<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.240> think<00:00:21.439> so

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you what we think so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.750 
you what we think so
the<00:00:22.949> Gribble<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:25.010> IIA<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.160> seee

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
locking carabiner strength ratings we've

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.819 
locking carabiner strength ratings we've
got<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.610> loaded<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.050> perfect<00:00:34.469> axis

got if it's loaded in the perfect axis

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.610 
got if it's loaded in the perfect axis
you've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.160> 27<00:00:35.790> kilonewtons<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.200> cross

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you've got 27 kilonewtons if it's cross

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.240 
you've got 27 kilonewtons if it's cross
loaded<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.460> 10<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.680> loaded<00:00:40.980> again

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
loaded it's 10 and if it's loaded again

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.479 
loaded it's 10 and if it's loaded again
but<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> gate<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> open<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.809> 10<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> I'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
but the gate is open it's 10 so I'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
but the gate is open it's 10 so I'm
going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> show<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> mechanism<00:00:45.270> here

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
going to show you the mechanism here

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
going to show you the mechanism here
it's<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> you've<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.680> two<00:00:47.100> gates<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it's got you've got two gates here this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
it's got you've got two gates here this
is<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> exterior<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> wanted<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
is the exterior one so if you wanted to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.459 
is the exterior one so if you wanted to
put<00:00:50.430> something<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> carabiner<00:00:51.870> you'd

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
put something into the carabiner you'd

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
put something into the carabiner you'd
have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> lift<00:00:53.520> open<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.090> exterior<00:00:54.600> gate

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
have to lift open this exterior gate

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770 
have to lift open this exterior gate
here<00:00:55.289> I've<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> cam<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> show<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here I've got a cam here to show you and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
here I've got a cam here to show you and
then<00:00:58.469> once<00:00:59.010> you've<00:00:59.160> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
then once you've kind of got it in that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
then once you've kind of got it in that
position<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> push<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
position you just push it like that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
position you just push it like that
pretty<00:01:02.670> easy<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.110> again

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
pretty easy and then to get it out again

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
pretty easy and then to get it out again
you<00:01:04.530> open<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> interior<00:01:05.939> gate<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> simply

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you open the interior gate and simply

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.160 
you open the interior gate and simply
pull<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.049> mean<00:01:13.049> there's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pull it off like so so I mean there's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
pull it off like so so I mean there's
not<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.509> works

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
not really much to it it it works

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.179 
not really much to it it it works
Gribble<00:01:16.860> market<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.930> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
Gribble market this as kind of the the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.080 
Gribble market this as kind of the the
new<00:01:21.090> slim<00:01:21.570> quick<00:01:22.380> version<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> service<00:01:23.759> crew

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
new slim quick version of a service crew

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780 
new slim quick version of a service crew
gate<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.680> mean<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.130> fulfill<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
gate so I mean does it fulfill that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.960 
gate so I mean does it fulfill that
purpose<00:01:27.150> well<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.860> certain<00:01:29.130> things<00:01:29.340> yes<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
purpose well for certain things yes I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.719 
purpose well for certain things yes I
mean<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.390> simple<00:01:30.810> applications<00:01:31.700> such<00:01:32.700> as

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
mean for simple applications such as

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
mean for simple applications such as
indoor<00:01:33.210> climbing<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.930> clipping<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
indoor climbing you know clipping into a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
indoor climbing you know clipping into a
belay<00:01:36.210> device<00:01:36.570> clipping<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.409> ropes<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
belay device clipping into ropes and and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
belay device clipping into ropes and and
into<00:01:38.909> any<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.890> gear<00:01:41.549> loops<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
into any of your your gear loops it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.590 
into any of your your gear loops it
works<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.200> mean<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.890> quite

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
works I mean it really is quite

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
works I mean it really is quite
effective<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.140> convenience<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
effective and the convenience and the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
effective and the convenience and the
quickness<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.780> shines<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> certainly<00:01:51.509> for

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
quickness really shines so certainly for

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
quickness really shines so certainly for
indoor<00:01:52.140> applications<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
indoor applications I like it I like it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.940 
indoor applications I like it I like it
a<00:01:54.540> lot

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
a lot

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.200 
a lot
huh<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> few<00:01:56.549> problems<00:01:56.850> with

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
huh but there are a few problems with

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.569 
huh but there are a few problems with
the<00:01:57.390> grifoll<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> first<00:01:58.950> problem<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the grifoll so the first problem is to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.999 
the grifoll so the first problem is to
use<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.939> one-handed<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> open

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
use it one-handed if you want to open

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
use it one-handed if you want to open
the<00:02:02.250> exterior<00:02:02.850> gate<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.180> pretty<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.630> have

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the exterior gate you pretty much have

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
the exterior gate you pretty much have
to<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.560> hand<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.100> overarching

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to have your hand in this overarching

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900 
to have your hand in this overarching
position<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.860> sort<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.520> lift<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
position here so you can sort of lift it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.249 
position here so you can sort of lift it
like<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
like that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.350 
like that
the<00:02:10.560> exterior<00:02:11.009> gate<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> stiff<00:02:12.120> which

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the exterior gate is kind of stiff which

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.090 
the exterior gate is kind of stiff which
isn't<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> huge<00:02:14.140> problem<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:14.950> means

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
isn't a huge problem but it just means

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.340 
isn't a huge problem but it just means
you<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.970> reasonable<00:02:16.690> purchase

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you have to have a reasonable purchase

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.710 
you have to have a reasonable purchase
on<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> caribiner<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.280> get<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.670> work<00:02:18.880> you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
on the caribiner to get it to work you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500 
on the caribiner to get it to work you
know<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.380> mean<00:02:20.560> I've<00:02:20.680> tried<00:02:20.860> sort<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> doing<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
know I mean I've tried sort of doing it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.300 
know I mean I've tried sort of doing it
like<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> really<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.680> quite<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.980> faff

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
like this but it really is quite a faff

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.490 
like this but it really is quite a faff
and<00:02:24.580> doesn't<00:02:24.850> work<00:02:24.970> very<00:02:25.030> well<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.320> there's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and doesn't work very well so there's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.380 
and doesn't work very well so there's
that<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.460> interior<00:02:27.970> gate<00:02:28.150> there's<00:02:28.270> no

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
that the interior gate there's no

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.970 
that the interior gate there's no
problem<00:02:28.720> at<00:02:28.840> all<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.020> mean<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.560> open<00:02:29.950> that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
problem at all I mean you can open that

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.340 
problem at all I mean you can open that
very<00:02:30.400> easily<00:02:30.640> from<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.120> variety<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.930> different

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
very easily from a variety of different

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.690 
very easily from a variety of different
angles<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.600> other<00:02:34.870> problem<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.860> exterior

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
angles the other problem is the exterior

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.480 
angles the other problem is the exterior
gate<00:02:37.150> only<00:02:37.360> opens<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:38.110> far<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.830> mean<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:39.400> you

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
gate only opens this far I mean if you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.690 
gate only opens this far I mean if you
look<00:02:39.640> at<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.820> gap<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:41.290> not<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.980> huge

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
look at the gap here that's not a huge

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.610 
look at the gap here that's not a huge
amount<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:43.090> space<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.690> actually<00:02:44.200> push<00:02:44.440> things

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
amount of space to actually push things

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.340 
amount of space to actually push things
into<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.040> carabiner<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:47.110> know<00:02:47.200> if

into the carabiner and you know if

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.650 
into the carabiner and you know if

you<00:03:27.670> don't<00:03:27.820> really<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.270> look<00:03:28.360> at<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.630> you

it make sure it's turned in the right
direction<00:03:42.820> make<00:03:43.390> sure<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.930> squeeze

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
direction make sure that you squeeze

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.310

open<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.250> right<00:03:45.370> gate<00:03:45.700> take<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.510> off<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.840> then

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
open the right gate take it off and then

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.440 
open the right gate take it off and then
you<00:03:47.440> have<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.890> change<00:03:48.459> around<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.090> open<00:03:49.330> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
you have to change around and open the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.420 
you have to change around and open the
exterior<00:03:50.050> gate<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.620> shove<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:50.950> through<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
exterior gate to shove it through the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.290 
exterior gate to shove it through the
material<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> mean<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.820> good<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.270> some

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
material so I mean it it's good in some

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.110 
material so I mean it it's good in some
respects<00:03:55.930> but<00:03:56.310> bad<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.489> others<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.970> mean

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
respects but bad in others I mean

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.930 
respects but bad in others I mean
essentially<00:03:58.510> Gribble<00:03:59.020> have<00:03:59.260> traded<00:04:00.010> they've

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
essentially Gribble have traded they've

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.310 
essentially Gribble have traded they've
solved<00:04:01.330> one<00:04:01.480> problem<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:01.959> they've<00:04:02.080> created

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
solved one problem but they've created

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.770 
solved one problem but they've created
another<00:04:02.800> just<00:04:03.130> by<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.820> design<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.570> twin

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
another just by the design of the twin

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.690 
another just by the design of the twin
gate<00:04:04.959> system<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.020> mean<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.550> wouldn't<00:04:09.550> say

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
gate system so it I mean I wouldn't say

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.850 
gate system so it I mean I wouldn't say
it's<00:04:09.880> any<00:04:10.030> better<00:04:10.780> than<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.170> screw<00:04:11.440> gate<00:04:11.680> I

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
it's any better than a screw gate I

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.410 
it's any better than a screw gate I
wouldn't<00:04:12.160> say<00:04:12.310> it's<00:04:12.459> any<00:04:12.610> worse<00:04:12.910> really

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
wouldn't say it's any worse really

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.390 
wouldn't say it's any worse really
because<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.440> know<00:04:14.470> for<00:04:14.709> indoor<00:04:14.950> climbing<00:04:15.340> it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
because you know for indoor climbing it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.630 
because you know for indoor climbing it
is<00:04:15.519> very<00:04:15.790> convenient<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.709> rather<00:04:18.190> suspect

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
is very convenient so I rather suspect

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.130 
is very convenient so I rather suspect
it's<00:04:18.790> kind<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.150> Marmite<00:04:19.480> product<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.049> know

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
it's kind of a Marmite product you know

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.779 
it's kind of a Marmite product you know
some<00:04:20.380> people<00:04:20.590> might<00:04:20.859> buy<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.609> it's

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
some people might buy it and think it's

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.600 
some people might buy it and think it's
fantastic<00:04:22.470> other<00:04:23.470> people<00:04:23.860> might<00:04:24.010> buy<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.370> say

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
fantastic other people might buy and say

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.850 
fantastic other people might buy and say
me<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.570> mean<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> might<00:04:26.200> as<00:04:26.229> well<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> screw

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
me I mean I might as well have a screw

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.120 
me I mean I might as well have a screw
gate

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
gate

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.180 
gate
and<00:04:27.310> that's<00:04:27.430> fine<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:28.810> say<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.710> you're<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.100> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
and that's fine I say if you're in the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.380 
and that's fine I say if you're in the
market<00:04:30.610> for<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.850> locking<00:04:31.210> carabiner

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
about it is it doesn't cost any more you

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.050 
about it is it doesn't cost any more you
know<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:35.980> cost<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.580> pick<00:04:36.730> these<00:04:36.850> up<00:04:36.910> for

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
cost any more than a high-quality large

cost any more than a high-quality large
HMS<00:04:46.240> screw<00:04:46.600> gate<00:04:46.840> so<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.260> worth<00:04:47.410> checking

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
HMS screw gate so it's worth checking

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.860 
HMS screw gate so it's worth checking
out<00:04:47.950> at<00:04:48.160> least<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.730> if<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.420> buy<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.660> you're

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
out at least and if you buy it you're

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.170 
out at least and if you buy it you're
not<00:04:49.960> entirely<00:04:50.290> happy<00:04:50.560> with<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:51.040> hey<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.090> know

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
not entirely happy with it hey you know

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.700 
not entirely happy with it hey you know
you<00:04:52.240> haven't<00:04:52.450> lost<00:04:52.660> anything<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.170> still<00:04:53.470> have

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
you haven't lost anything you still have

you haven't lost anything you still have
a<00:04:53.950> locking<00:04:54.580> carabiner<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.780> just<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.440> little

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
a locking carabiner it's just a little

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.850 
a locking carabiner it's just a little
bit<00:04:57.190> more<00:04:57.340> fiddly<00:04:57.580> sometimes<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.590> anyway

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
bit more fiddly sometimes so anyway

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.460 
bit more fiddly sometimes so anyway
there<00:05:00.040> is<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.370> Gribble<00:05:00.910> make<00:05:01.840> at<00:05:01.990> Wingate
