00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.259
 so for the piece titled first 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.889
 piece so you see that there is a 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.990
 sharp at a time and is noted before the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.089
 note and he's on the floor so instead 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.560
 du and the soil jauron le 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:28.429
 and as the third line begins 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.019
 so with audition number 4 the finger that 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.210
 will have on the sharp ground so it's not 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.250
 this one since that of the lace the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.870
 number three is the ground so 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.309
 it's number two there will be instead 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.890
 to go on the floor he will go to the ground 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.030
 sharp 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.220
 so I'm going to play you the piece with 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 both hands the metronome and the fingering 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.100

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.329
