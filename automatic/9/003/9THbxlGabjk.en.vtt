00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 roj 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.910
 is the disappointment of the shutdown 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.489
 processed somewhat against Volendam 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.779
 Of course, they will have to be disappointed and win the peace now 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:17.909
 in the cup 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.390
 think she 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.159
 this is also important 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.069
 can happen in the outpost that's how it is 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.550
 but we must again 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.599
 I think more for Sunday 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 there is a very important competition 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.400
 we have well trained people today 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.500
 yes now only bystanders can see last Wednesday 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.110
 that the attitude we used has not led us to success 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.690
 is 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.830
 that of course also led to the necessary discussion with us but 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.400
 what that looks like when it looks like it is just announced on Sunday 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.080
 how's ankle 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.940
 he goes better than it should be 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.130
 it is an earlier stage in order we have to look at why it is still there 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.730
 48 hours and that can do you much the danish 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.960
 it is certainly for Sunday but buying out total 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.200
 we are still four points ahead of PSV 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.110
 the other side are equivalent to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 nac and with a starter therefore also a million viewers there 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.730
 yes i think the absolute necessity just like you do on some occasionally 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.990
 points are lagging behind and you must necessarily win that out on the league 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.050
 getting a good ending for your own business 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.930
 then but it's up to others 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.000
 that gives a very different feeling 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.020
 all in all, I think that we just as it is not in the past matches 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 have to look too much at the stand 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.350
 the match in itself against PSV is deep trough match that is the special 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.510
 but we must focus on our own 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.440
 sparrow the agreements we make 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 it is quite possible to comply and then we look forward to seeing that for a year 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 slagharen 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 the last year of psv 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.940
 After waiting a while I have seen PSV take a brand and reported PSV 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.360
 care said bob there is a lot of busy program playing a film competition here and there 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.880
 the french city that the un must put the pressure the first 10 to 15 minutes to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.959
 Japan 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.400
 I know for sure the trapeze can combine and defense and wait there 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.179
 on the 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.609
 on the chance to make the switch and then it must go quickly afterwards 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.379
 intestinal bacterium look for 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.459
 but I think the white man yesterday said the parties are teeming with people and people 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.319
 Concentrate in the game and think if we have the Gendt Sparta 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.289
 I go to Maria 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.479
 then i think 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.739
 well i have china psv the lancet a good art if it goes well both 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.319
 lost it plays well 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.549
 and the cost this old man played like it is a thalys like a whole 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.289
 seasonally and 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.769
 I am confident that that could have been that
