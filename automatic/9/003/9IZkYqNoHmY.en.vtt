00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.840 
that to be on had difficulty he's just
so<00:00:40.030> big<00:00:40.390> he's<00:00:41.320> got<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:41.800> much<00:00:41.950> power<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.460> she

just<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.680> normal<00:04:09.100> match<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.600> wasting<00:04:10.600> time<00:04:10.840> I

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
just a normal match was wasting time I

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.530 
just a normal match was wasting time I
think<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.350> was<00:04:11.579> because<00:04:12.579> it<00:04:12.940> wasn't<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.359> main

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
think it was because it wasn't a main

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.840 
think it was because it wasn't a main
event<00:04:13.870> much<00:04:14.079> like<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:15.190> main<00:04:15.400> event<00:04:15.430> match

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
event much like that main event match

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930 
event much like that main event match
