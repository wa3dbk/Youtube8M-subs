disaster to me music is is part of the

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.820 
disaster to me music is is part of the
sound<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:48.660> lot<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.780> people<00:01:50.110> think<00:01:50.380> music

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
sound and a lot of people think music

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.550 
sound and a lot of people think music
music<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.570> create<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.900> mood<00:01:53.200> or

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
music is like to create a mood or

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.510 
music is like to create a mood or
creator<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:55.690> always<00:01:56.530> like<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> background<00:01:57.280> and

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
creator is always like a background and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.230 
creator is always like a background and
I<00:01:57.670> think<00:01:57.700> sometimes<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.720> music<00:01:58.869> can<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.970> be

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
I think sometimes the music can can be

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.020 
I think sometimes the music can can be
the<00:02:01.360> front<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.619> image<00:02:02.950> can<00:02:03.580> be<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.820> back

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the front and the image can be the back

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:16.410 
the front and the image can be the back
it<00:02:04.570> can<00:02:04.930> play<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.940> music<00:02:16.300> should

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it can play like that the music should

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.290 
it can play like that the music should
dance<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.170> image

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
dance with the image

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.510 
dance with the image
if<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.930> lose<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:22.240> keep<00:02:22.480> moving<00:02:23.520> hope

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
if you lose them just keep moving hope

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.910 
if you lose them just keep moving hope
for<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.820> best<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:30.450> think<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:32.350> running<00:02:32.710> back

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
for the best I think just running back

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680 
for the best I think just running back
it's<00:02:33.100> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.370> dull<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.420> round

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it's going to dull you can get round

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
it's going to dull you can get round
back<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.340> speed<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.720> better<00:02:37.930> shot<00:02:39.180> after

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
back into speed it's a better shot after

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.270 
back into speed it's a better shot after
doing<00:02:40.900> Crouching<00:02:41.320> Tiger<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.920> fall<00:02:42.130> in

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
jobs and when you try to figure out what

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080 
jobs and when you try to figure out what
must<00:02:53.800> be<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.100> their<00:02:54.280> mind<00:02:54.550> what's<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
must be in their mind what's the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.480 
must be in their mind what's the
reaction<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.780> what<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.620> choreographed<00:02:57.370> a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
reaction to what then choreographed a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.240 
reaction to what then choreographed a
number<00:02:57.820> from<00:02:58.000> there<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:59.290> think<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.920> number

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
number from there and I think the number

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.560 
number from there and I think the number
could<00:03:00.400> look<00:03:00.550> very<00:03:00.610> interesting<00:03:01.360> very

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
could look very interesting very

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.840

from<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.250> previous<00:03:16.460> movies<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.600> you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
from the previous movies is that you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.380 
from the previous movies is that you
