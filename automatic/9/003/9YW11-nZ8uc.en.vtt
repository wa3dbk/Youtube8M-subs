00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
just kind of hard to do and you'll see

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
just kind of hard to do and you'll see
why<00:00:16.859> soon<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> want<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.600> call

why soon but what you want to do is call

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830 
why soon but what you want to do is call
Lester<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.380> request<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.070> job<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.689> you're

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
Lester and request a job and if you're

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.050 
Lester and request a job and if you're
lucky<00:00:22.020> enough<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.650> will<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.279> job<00:00:23.550> called

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
lucky enough you will get the job called

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.509 
lucky enough you will get the job called
high<00:00:24.660> priority<00:00:25.410> case<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.310> there

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
high priority case as you can see there

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
high priority case as you can see there
so<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.150> keep<00:00:27.240> requesting<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.750> job<00:00:27.960> until<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so just keep requesting a job until you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.570 
so just keep requesting a job until you
get<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.949> took<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> little

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
get that it actually took me a little

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.040 
get that it actually took me a little
while<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.779> went<00:00:30.900> through

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
while to get it's like I went through

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
while to get it's like I went through
every<00:00:31.380> job<00:00:31.590> besides<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.610> once<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
every job besides that one but once you

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
every job besides that one but once you
get<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.090> job<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.600> ahead<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.870> accept<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
get that job go ahead and accept it and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
get that job go ahead and accept it and
then<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> leave<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> settings<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
then you can leave all the settings the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
then you can leave all the settings the
same<00:00:36.360> except<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.230> easy<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.710> doesn't

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
same except I put it on easy it doesn't

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.170 
same except I put it on easy it doesn't
really<00:00:38.070> matter<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.790> hard<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
really matter you can put it on hard and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
really matter you can put it on hard and
be<00:00:39.270> 1.5<00:00:39.809> times<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> RP<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.040> bit

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
be 1.5 times the RP to get a little bit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
be 1.5 times the RP to get a little bit
more<00:00:41.370> RP<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> put<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.239> easy<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
more RP but I put it on easy for the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.650 
more RP but I put it on easy for the
sake<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.920> tutorial<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.030> once<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> spawn

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
sake of the tutorial so once you spawn

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.060 
sake of the tutorial so once you spawn
you<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.020> ahead<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> call<00:00:46.440> Pegasus

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you want to go ahead and call Pegasus

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
you want to go ahead and call Pegasus
you'll<00:00:47.430> need<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.910> buzzard<00:00:48.390> attack<00:00:48.690> chopper

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you'll need a buzzard attack chopper

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.660 
you'll need a buzzard attack chopper
because<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> mission<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
because this is the mission where you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
because this is the mission where you
have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.750> top<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
have to go all the way up to the top of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.240 
have to go all the way up to the top of
the<00:00:52.079> construction<00:00:52.469> building<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> steal<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the construction building and steal a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610 
the construction building and steal a
briefcase<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.480> ahead<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.690> call<00:00:54.960> Pegasus

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
briefcase so go ahead and call Pegasus

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.270 
briefcase so go ahead and call Pegasus
or<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.899> helicopter<00:00:57.899> pickup<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.859> Merriweather

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
or a helicopter pickup from Merriweather

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
or a helicopter pickup from Merriweather
and<00:00:59.489> still<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> helicopter<00:01:00.270> doesn't<00:01:00.570> really

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and still a helicopter doesn't really

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
and still a helicopter doesn't really
matter<00:01:00.899> I'd<00:01:01.469> recommend<00:01:01.829> doing<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.399> Pegasus

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
matter I'd recommend doing the Pegasus

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
matter I'd recommend doing the Pegasus
one<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.539> rockets<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> locks

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
one because it has rockets and it locks

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
one because it has rockets and it locks
onto<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> enemies<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.760> once<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.090> ahead

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
onto the enemies so once you go ahead

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.340 
onto the enemies so once you go ahead
and<00:01:06.330> order<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.750> ahead<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.990> pick<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and order that go ahead and pick it up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
and order that go ahead and pick it up
then<00:01:07.890> once<00:01:08.100> you've<00:01:08.250> picked<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
then once you've picked it up you just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.100 
then once you've picked it up you just
want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> head<00:01:09.299> over<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> construction

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
want to head over to the construction

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
want to head over to the construction
building<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.650> unload<00:01:11.040> everything<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.760> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
building and unload everything you got I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.310 
building and unload everything you got I
recommend<00:01:12.330> pulling<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> Rockets

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
recommend pulling out the Rockets

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
recommend pulling out the Rockets
because<00:01:13.590> once<00:01:13.799> again<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:14.970> lock

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
because once again it can actually lock

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.820 
because once again it can actually lock
on<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> enemies<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.080> top<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> building<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
on to enemies on top of the building so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.140

over to lectures warehouse for the
delivery<00:01:44.630> all<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.960> once<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.320> here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
delivery all right now once you're here

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810 
delivery all right now once you're here
you<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> hover<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.310> helicopter

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

you just want to hover your helicopter
over<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> yellow<00:01:48.329> circle<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
over the yellow circle now this is the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
over the yellow circle now this is the
difficult<00:01:49.799> part<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.790> such<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> small

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
difficult part because it's such a small

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.990 
difficult part because it's such a small
circle<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.770> could<00:01:52.920> easily<00:01:53.159> accidentally

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
circle and you could easily accidentally

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
circle and you could easily accidentally
deliver<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> restart<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
deliver it and you have to restart this

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.260 
deliver it and you have to restart this
whole<00:01:56.009> process<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.579> again<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
whole process over again so you have to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
whole process over again so you have to
be<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.689> careful<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> actually

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
be really really careful but I actually

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
be really really careful but I actually
went<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.549> whole<00:01:59.759> level<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> higher

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
went up a whole level in the higher

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.740 
went up a whole level in the higher
100's<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> lower<00:02:02.100> 100<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.630> get

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
100's or in the lower 100 so you do get

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
100's or in the lower 100 so you do get
a<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:03.990> amount<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.290> XP<00:02:04.649> probably<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
a good amount of XP probably if you do

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
a good amount of XP probably if you do
this<00:02:05.490> correctly<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.329> an<00:02:06.390> hour<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.750> could<00:02:07.020> get

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this correctly for an hour you could get

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.589 
this correctly for an hour you could get
over<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> million<00:02:07.950> easily<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.149> yeah<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
over a million easily but yeah as you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.790 
over a million easily but yeah as you
can<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> correctly<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
can see if you do it correctly and you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
can see if you do it correctly and you
hover<00:02:11.039> over<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.610> low<00:02:11.730> enough<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.300> get

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
hover over just low enough you do get

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.090 
hover over just low enough you do get
some<00:02:12.569> RP

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
some RP

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.610 
some RP
and<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.640> RP<00:02:13.970> bar<00:02:14.150> increases<00:02:14.720> now<00:02:14.960> obviously

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and the RP bar increases now obviously

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
and the RP bar increases now obviously
it<00:02:16.130> does<00:02:16.430> look<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:16.880> going<00:02:17.030> slow<00:02:17.360> but

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
it does look like it's going slow but

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.180 
it does look like it's going slow but
it's<00:02:17.750> not<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.410> takes<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.710> long<00:02:18.890> time<00:02:18.950> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.250 
it's not it just takes a long time to
update<00:02:19.460> but<00:02:20.210> if<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.390> do<00:02:20.510> press<00:02:20.750> down<00:02:20.990> while
