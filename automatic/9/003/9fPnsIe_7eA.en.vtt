the stainless steel double edged blade

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150 
the stainless steel double edged blade
I<00:00:44.059> thought<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> points<00:00:45.629> were<00:00:45.780> weak<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I thought the points were weak and you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.090 
I thought the points were weak and you
could<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.610> compromised<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> fight

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
could really be compromised in a fight

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.430

however<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.059> fought<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.750> knives

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
however the more I fought with knives

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
however the more I fought with knives
the<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> learned<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.059> appreciate<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the more I learned to appreciate the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.799 
the more I learned to appreciate the
advantage<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.559> double-edged<00:00:56.010> blade

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
advantage of a double-edged blade

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
advantage of a double-edged blade
problem<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.199> hated<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> double-edged

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
problem was I hated all the double-edged

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610 
problem was I hated all the double-edged
blades<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> market<00:01:00.149> none<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.350> cut

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
very well the points were weak they were

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
very well the points were weak they were
totally<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.589> unsuitable<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> fighting

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
totally really unsuitable as a fighting

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
military context but as a fighting knife
they're<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.330> worthless<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:13.500> why

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they're pretty much worthless that's why

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
they're pretty much worthless that's why
I<00:01:13.710> decided<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> design<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.030> Taipan<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I decided to design the Taipan so that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
I decided to design the Taipan so that
people<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.369> were<00:01:17.430> interested<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.119> fighting

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
people that were interested in fighting

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
people that were interested in fighting
knives<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.740> learning<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> use

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
knives and really learning how to use

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
knives and really learning how to use
them<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.509> knife<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.409> match

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
them would have a knife that would match

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.100 
them would have a knife that would match
their<00:01:22.890> skill<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.490> took<00:01:24.270> everything<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.900> knew

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
