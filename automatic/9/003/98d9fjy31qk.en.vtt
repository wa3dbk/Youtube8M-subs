00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.020
 in the eagle's chest on Sunday afternoon against cohen I as coach frank the farmer with him 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.039
 somewhat modified battle plan 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.919
 not so very striking was that the latter is certainly in the forefront but that 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.579
 Davy Klaassen played as the controlling midfielder 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.579
 in 2005 why 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.689
 please stimulate the microphone 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.029
 we go midfield of course also the defender also mo 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859
 I think the bv 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.960
 currently 9 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.090
 could do setup 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.050
 He has the brands where most control 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.740
 on behalf of summer full point 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 see inside but also continue for months 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.370
 hence I knew the position in the board a help to change 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 that had actually remained more the coach of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.530
 would normally visit 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 but in the future renÃ© visits the games of chance very well 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.399
 it is often said 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.520
 that is a very responsible position 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.360
 that is very much involved so it is not without reason that this is often the case 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 they agree with players because it changes a very complicated position 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.180
 there can be a valuable set-up but the company with nicotine one 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.730
 the local residents with two star players a year I want is for that 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.579
 pushed forward the right one 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.080
 to release the man 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.430
 and then we put pressure 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.690
 I am that has anpv 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 I think that takes very good expression 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.320
 in the last week extra 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.140
 put in some time and more 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.500
 intricacies both legs of the position of the euro will be ours in no time 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.970
 a day in advance prof 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 also the firing 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 but that was also because we thought when you also vidzone 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.940
 the instance became 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.310
 it is today duinrell was still what it is doubtful 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.140
 davy rarely city where many backwards theo mann bid anp 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.280
 now is certain 4 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 she was cold in the field of actually having the council saturday 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 some trained help 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.420
 with a tree 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.389
 what we expected 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.619
 Serbia is going to play six 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 they argue 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.560
 intellectually certain in terms of football that the agreement is understandable and a pity 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.699
 otherwise I would have put him in it, who are playing in more 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.999
 which you expect 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.029
 picked up very quickly and 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.089
 i think i better the game rules 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.749
 he is the Rhine for a reason 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.749
 one of the leaders I think there is another place where he will play more often 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.739
 as soon as they are sold again 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.299
 for the ordinary how it goes right now one that can be without being wants 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.039
 can be a bill 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.609
 the games 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.059
 do not fuel and channels 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.030
 people can all be the one falling 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.539
 the positions in midfield 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.740
 normally falls come 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.729
 how it's going 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:02.019
 This benefits from being made 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.289
 that is now the world 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.089
 that is the umpteenth world is the debate 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.289
 we must also consider 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.729
 liu hangs in the plus and minus after an honest sit against and there are per barrel 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.169
 ultimately the best formula 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.939
 then check the rush hour diesel 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.189
 it is against az 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.699
 on the contrary, better english than the steamboat pastor will be on site 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.599
 after he get the ball 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.169
 gave the time 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.169
 and rest for 10 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.169
 and that's what you have asked for 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.389
 much better 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.829
 first goal textbook example of how he collapses then we play 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:45.799
 Japan is chasing a better business cycle while running an offside dam 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.959
 anyway 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.889
 the speed can 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.689
 he then used his again 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.349
 This is also because doctors who keep young top musicians closed on training 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.939
 this moment I say this 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.209
 mole needs and 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.549
 ultimately it is possible 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.169
 we hope again that not just in that position and can come to breathe 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.699
 he is more focused to also score a goal because the combination you 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:13.959
 just like that 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.959
 be the point of contact and the finisher must be yes 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.539
 it must be someone who money what they are now for us to pay for 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:23.960
 the resident why 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.059
 to stop and be and definitions were then 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.919
 all walk 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.259
 is this also to the place where a person can break 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.259
 well we want to get rid of that 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.669
 I just watch 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.840
 romney being a member of a trend an it may just be your 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.749
 it was therefore gold still provoke this is one 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.020
 are needed to the man 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.610
 The two attacking Czech midfielders always make you slim Alkmaar 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.039
 here it seems to me a sign that you can do this kind of player just as well 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:53.940
 use 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.250
 be smart yes but ultimately euros 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740
 You should always have that type of player in your team 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.389
 there are a head faster than the ball actually one 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.860
 therefore they may not always be the three meter width we are again with one 

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:13.839
 high 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.669
 therefore be able to play on top football 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.939
 just looking at messi about it 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.699
 they can often be made 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.059
 the players who are just that little bit faster now think you make the difference 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.779
 chinese people play 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.050
 no resemblance at all 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.050
 it is a player on his balcony 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.349
 he has his cleverness against them
