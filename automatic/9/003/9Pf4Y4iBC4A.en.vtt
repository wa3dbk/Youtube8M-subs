away so I thought I'm probably not gonna
kill<00:02:29.459> him<00:02:29.610> again<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.510> am<00:02:30.690> exposing<00:02:31.110> myself

so<00:02:55.709> if<00:02:56.040> Lee<00:02:56.370> sin<00:02:56.579> starts<00:02:56.880> back<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.299> way<00:02:57.420> do

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
so if Lee sin starts back in a way do

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.559 
so if Lee sin starts back in a way do
roam<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.280> could<00:02:59.459> give<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.640> tip<00:03:00.239> that's

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
roam if I could give one tip that's

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.780 
roam if I could give one tip that's
really<00:03:00.870> useful<00:03:01.019> against<00:03:01.620> Lee<00:03:01.769> sin<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.579> would

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
really useful against Lee sin that would

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.960 
really useful against Lee sin that would
be<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.150> soon<00:03:03.660> as<00:03:03.690> he<00:03:04.019> lands<00:03:04.260> his<00:03:04.590> Q<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.610> straight
