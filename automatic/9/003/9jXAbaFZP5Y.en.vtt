00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.810
 this year they will cross many serious 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.230
 obstacles 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.770
 I knew it was going to be hard but good I think 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.100
 that I have to try to be strong 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 be realistic I know that the players that I 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.849
 I have ahead 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.859
 the truth is going to be hard as I told you 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.680
 nothing this this moment that happens to me 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.650
 the selection the truth that it was a pretty 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.329
 experience is good for me to have 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.740
 international friction I think that 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.010
 well we are preparing all 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.800
 according to the group the team to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.070
 within a year is the South American as well 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 that preparing me and preparing everything 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 the team to give a good South American 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.810
 always playing on the river always you have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.630
 that that pressure that rivalry of 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.900
 say you have to make a goal whether you want to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.690
 it's hard for a striker for a 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.240
 river player because you always have 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.010
 to be demonstrating how he touched me in the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.510
 past championship prove nothing difficult 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.360
 what people are watching you in all 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.780
 sides you know that even if it's a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780
 match 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 it's very important for the tournament very 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 ok but we knew that day to day area 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 than fight it 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 we had to take it forward 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.560
 now with the arrival of fernando I think 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 that made us very well 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 it was very positive so good today 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 is showing how the team is doing 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 I think there were many more situations of 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.020
 what of what happened the walker 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.880
 gone so the truth that very well 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 for everything we are doing today I 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.159
 it played to learn from two players today 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 fernando 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.020
 good nothing difficult d 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.280
 of trying to learn from this place 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.310
 where is he touching me now because 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.039
 obviously knowing that I do not have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.610
 many to know that I have many 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.070
 obstacles I know I have to learn from 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.640
 what I try to have 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.560
 good workouts being having 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.460
 matches with a selection that too 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.530
 will make me learn not only at the level 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.510
 football but also at the level 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.820
 group I think we also have to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.790
 learn to know how to get along with a 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.540
 group to live with a group I think 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.580
 those things today are going to touch me 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.080
 learn during I think it 's temporary 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.790
 to the possibility of being able to talk to 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.189
 ramÃ³n 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.310
 well I got to do two acquaintances the 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.150
 23 days has arrived 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.400
 I think one when when he knows what 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.440
 what's happening in the games of how 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.870
 the group is full and how is it going 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.880
 each player I think that little by little one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.510
 will give an account in the place where it 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.140
 each 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.450
 but, well, the truth is that with age 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.970
 that I have with the experience that I have 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.040
 I think I have to be calm not 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.299
 think about him 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 in what can be to join us 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.860
 get ahead in things 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.860
 I think I have to try to add 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.450
 experience to add minutes inside of 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.300
 Wherever the court where touch me 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.920
 to play 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.080
 and the truth is that nothing good that's why I 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.380
 he liked that he is calm and for now you 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.380
 weather
