00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
teeth in my point well I would be a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.960 
teeth in my point well I would be a
little<00:05:11.200> bit<00:05:11.380> like<00:05:11.590> saying<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:12.010> we<00:05:12.370> can<00:05:12.670> clean

our teeth by eating pretzels I don't
think<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.150> would<00:05:16.330> work<00:05:16.450> very<00:05:16.660> well<00:05:17.580> does<00:05:18.580> it

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
think that would work very well does it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.150 
think that would work very well does it
work<00:05:18.760> very<00:05:19.210> well<00:05:19.380> having<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.470> healthy<00:05:20.920> mouth

with<00:05:27.550> with<00:05:28.240> dry<00:05:28.480> food<00:05:28.780> what<00:05:29.350> about<00:05:29.440> salmonella

with with dry food what about salmonella
well<00:05:31.990> salmonella<00:05:32.920> is<00:05:33.280> certainly<00:05:34.500> not<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.560> very

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
well salmonella is certainly not a very

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.770 
well salmonella is certainly not a very
common<00:05:36.070> issue<00:05:36.490> but<00:05:36.730> it<00:05:36.790> can<00:05:37.030> be<00:05:37.210> present<00:05:37.660> in

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
common issue but it can be present in

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.260 
common issue but it can be present in
some<00:05:38.080> raw<00:05:38.320> meats<00:05:38.650> there<00:05:39.520> has<00:05:39.730> been<00:05:39.760> research

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
some raw meats there has been research

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.360 
some raw meats there has been research
that<00:05:40.870> has<00:05:40.990> proven<00:05:41.320> that<00:05:41.560> you<00:05:41.860> can<00:05:41.890> feed

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
that has proven that you can feed

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.760 
that has proven that you can feed
salmonella<00:05:43.210> as<00:05:43.480> part<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.080> chicken<00:05:44.530> for

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
salmonella as part of chicken for

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.450 
salmonella as part of chicken for
example<00:05:45.190> chicken<00:05:45.550> meat<00:05:45.760> to<00:05:46.390> dogs<00:05:47.320> it's<00:05:48.310> been

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
example chicken meat to dogs it's been

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.870 
example chicken meat to dogs it's been
done<00:05:48.670> with<00:05:48.880> greyhounds<00:05:49.750> at<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.960> track<00:05:50.230> and

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
done with greyhounds at the track and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.880 
done with greyhounds at the track and
they'll<00:05:51.880> eat<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.180> and<00:05:52.420> they'll<00:05:53.050> digest<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.740> and

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
they'll eat it and they'll digest it and

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.800 
they'll eat it and they'll digest it and
they'll<00:05:54.190> do<00:05:54.340> just<00:05:54.400> fine<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.420> can<00:05:55.570> test

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
they'll do just fine and you can test

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.200 
they'll do just fine and you can test
the<00:05:56.020> stool<00:05:56.290> and<00:05:56.620> there's<00:05:57.280> so<00:05:57.520> another<00:05:57.880> there

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the stool and there's so another there

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.780 
the stool and there's so another there
so<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.080> know<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.680> salmonella

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
so you know that salmonella

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.630 
so you know that salmonella
in<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.930> come<00:06:02.140> out<00:06:02.170> the<00:06:02.560> back<00:06:02.740> door<00:06:02.770> so<00:06:03.460> it

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
in and it's come out the back door so it

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.030 
in and it's come out the back door so it
didn't<00:06:03.910> really<00:06:03.970> affect<00:06:04.210> them<00:06:04.660> inside<00:06:05.410> because

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
didn't really affect them inside because

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.220 
didn't really affect them inside because
it<00:06:06.070> just<00:06:06.310> went<00:06:06.610> right<00:06:06.760> through<00:06:07.030> no<00:06:07.600> it's<00:06:08.080> an
