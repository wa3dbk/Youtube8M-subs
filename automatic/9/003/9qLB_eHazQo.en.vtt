there<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.509> one<00:00:15.509> tablet<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.529> saw

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
there is one one tablet we actually saw

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.480 
there is one one tablet we actually saw
it<00:00:16.920> int'l<00:00:17.369> both<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.020> 3g<00:00:19.020> enabled<00:00:19.680> tablet<00:00:20.310> with

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it int'l both so 3g enabled tablet with

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.230 
it int'l both so 3g enabled tablet with
touch<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.510> that's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> cool<00:00:22.800> thing<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.760> I'm

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
touch so that's a cool thing and if I'm

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.900 
touch so that's a cool thing and if I'm
right<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.080> actually<00:00:25.439> running

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
right this is actually running

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.320 
right this is actually running
moorestown<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.920> with<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> pixel<00:00:29.550> screen<00:00:29.730> with

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
moorestown on with the pixel screen with

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.880 
moorestown on with the pixel screen with
pixel<00:00:30.689> Qi<00:00:30.890> capacitive<00:00:32.210> touch<00:00:33.210> panel<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.079> we

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
pixel Qi capacitive touch panel so we

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
pixel Qi capacitive touch panel so we
have<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> closer<00:00:35.700> look<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.630> later

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have to take a closer look of that later

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.569 
have to take a closer look of that later
but<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.920> concentrating<00:00:38.190> on

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
but right now we are concentrating on

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.630 
but right now we are concentrating on
pixel<00:00:38.910> Qi<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.780> another<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.739> again

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
pixel Qi there is another one again

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.470 
pixel Qi there is another one again

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.889 
touch screen layer on top of the screen
I<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.649> show<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.789> screen<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.450> full

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I will show you the screen in full

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.080 
I will show you the screen in full
action<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.550> near<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
action here because what we have near is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.069 
action here because what we have near is
a<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> vacant<00:00:53.070> digitizer<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a is a vacant digitizer on the on the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
a is a vacant digitizer on the on the
screen<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:56.190> turn<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
screen and we can actually turn off the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
screen and we can actually turn off the
screen<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:58.109> how<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> looks

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
screen so that that's how it looks

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
screen so that that's how it looks
without<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> backlight<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.539> course<00:01:00.840> as

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
without the backlight and of course as

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.490 
without the backlight and of course as
you<00:01:01.980> should<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.210> key<00:01:03.600> element<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you should know the key element here is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
you should know the key element here is
that<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> outside<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that you can use this outside in in a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
that you can use this outside in in a
sunlight<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.670> uses<00:01:09.920> really<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.570> much

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sunlight and it uses really really much

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800 
sunlight and it uses really really much
much<00:01:13.280> less<00:01:14.280> battery<00:01:14.549> than<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> standard

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
much less battery than the standard

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
much less battery than the standard
backlighted<00:01:16.560> screen<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.729> looking

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
backlighted screen so it's looking

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.530 
backlighted screen so it's looking
really<00:01:18.210> good<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.869> also<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.540> believe

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really good this is also there I believe

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.700 
really good this is also there I believe
this<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> new<00:01:24.229> better<00:01:25.229> viewing

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this one is with a new better viewing

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.219 
this one is with a new better viewing
angle<00:01:26.310> angle<00:01:28.820> screen<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.900> see

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
angle angle screen so you can really see

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
angle angle screen so you can really see
that<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.650> no<00:01:31.829> problem<00:01:32.280> whatsoever<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that there is no problem whatsoever on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
that there is no problem whatsoever on
the<00:01:33.090> viewing<00:01:33.540> angles<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.409> looking

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the viewing angles it's it's looking

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.359 
the viewing angles it's it's looking
really<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.600> demo<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.369> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
really nice this is just a demo of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
really nice this is just a demo of the
capabilities<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> touch

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
capabilities so here with the touch

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
screen and if we turn the light off it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.730 
screen and if we turn the light off it's
again

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
again

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.490
