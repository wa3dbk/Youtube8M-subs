with<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> fork<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
with a fork in with that because that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
with a fork in with that because that
will<00:01:15.420> probably<00:01:15.720> blow<00:01:15.840> microwave<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> then

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
will probably blow microwave up and then

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 
will probably blow microwave up and then
you'll<00:01:17.100> probably<00:01:17.220> sue<00:01:17.520> me<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> I've<00:01:17.970> probably

bear in mind you've increased the volume
in<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:09.659> so<00:03:09.930> you're<00:03:10.049> not<00:03:10.109> going<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
in there so you're not going to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.349 
in there so you're not going to
completely<00:03:10.650> fill<00:03:10.919> these<00:03:11.099> up<00:03:11.129> maybe<00:03:11.819> you're<00:03:12.060> if

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
you're making loads you can make a soup

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.729 
you're making loads you can make a soup
out<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.040> none<00:03:14.219> of<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.340> let's<00:03:14.909> fill<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.739> yes

out of it none of that let's fill up yes
there's<00:03:16.949> not<00:03:17.069> too<00:03:17.250> much<00:03:17.400> technique<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
there's not too much technique to this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.879 
there's not too much technique to this
all<00:03:18.299> I'm<00:03:18.419> doing<00:03:18.659> is<00:03:18.720> basically<00:03:19.079> ramming<00:03:19.799> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
all I'm doing is basically ramming the

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.860 
all I'm doing is basically ramming the
filling<00:03:20.159> into<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.609> shells<00:03:20.879> as<00:03:21.150> simple<00:03:21.810> as

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
filling into the shells as simple as

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.960 
filling into the shells as simple as
that<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.310> there<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.489> then<00:03:23.669> look<00:03:23.849> at

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that really there we go then look at

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.059 
that really there we go then look at
them<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.389> pair<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.810> rebel<00:03:25.319> hotdogs<00:03:25.769> what

them like a pair of rebel hotdogs what

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.890 
them like a pair of rebel hotdogs what
we<00:03:26.159> do<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.699> whack<00:03:27.030> em<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.329> oven<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.720> then

we do is whack em in the oven and then

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.479 
we do is whack em in the oven and then
we<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.139> working<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.470> topping<00:03:28.799> yep<00:03:29.159> same<00:03:29.310> they

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
we can working on topping yep same they
