00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
showing you how to import plugins into

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.070 
showing you how to import plugins into
your<00:00:08.040> server<00:00:08.309> now<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.120> nice<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.630> easy<00:00:09.719> but

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
your server now it's nice and easy but

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.110 
your server now it's nice and easy but
I'm<00:00:10.200> basically<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.759> go<00:00:11.880> through

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
I'm basically just going to go through

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480 
I'm basically just going to go through
most<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> problems<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.170> occur<00:00:13.490> so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
most of the problems that can occur so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.010 
most of the problems that can occur so
I'm<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.269> using<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.630> Tekkit<00:00:15.990> server

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I'm going to be using my Tekkit server

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.160 
I'm going to be using my Tekkit server
as<00:00:16.560> an<00:00:16.800> example<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.900> work<00:00:19.050> from

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
as an example but this will work from

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.260 
as an example but this will work from
vanilla<00:00:19.500> minecraft<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.130> process<00:00:20.550> exactly<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
vanilla minecraft to process exactly the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.720 
vanilla minecraft to process exactly the
same<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> I'll<00:00:23.039> basically<00:00:23.160> show<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> how<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
same so I'll basically show you how to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.800 
same so I'll basically show you how to
put<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> I've<00:00:25.680> downloaded<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> plug-in

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
put it in so I've downloaded the plug-in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
put it in so I've downloaded the plug-in
you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> dot<00:00:28.470> jar<00:00:28.740> file<00:00:28.980> actually

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you can see it's a dot jar file actually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.519 
you can see it's a dot jar file actually
one<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> problems<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
one of the problems that you can have is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
one of the problems that you can have is
it<00:00:31.830> doesn't<00:00:32.399> turn<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> dock<00:00:33.239> jar<00:00:33.480> file

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it doesn't turn out as a dock jar file

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.299 
it doesn't turn out as a dock jar file
so<00:00:34.110> I've<00:00:34.230> download<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.860> called<00:00:35.070> real

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so I've download this one called real

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
so I've download this one called real
weather<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.960> doesn't<00:00:37.140> turn<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.649> dot

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
weather so if it doesn't turn out to dot

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.880 
weather so if it doesn't turn out to dot
jar<00:00:38.100> file<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.270> properties<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.989> change<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
jar file go on properties and change it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
jar file go on properties and change it
from<00:00:40.980> WinRAR<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> Java<00:00:42.260> simple<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:44.390> lot

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
from WinRAR to Java simple as that a lot

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.490 
from WinRAR to Java simple as that a lot
of<00:00:45.450> people<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.809> quite<00:00:45.989> stressed<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of people can get quite stressed to that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.459 
of people can get quite stressed to that
and<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.010> give<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.230> in<00:00:49.230> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and then they just give up and in your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.340 
and then they just give up and in your
server<00:00:49.980> folder<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.390> ignore<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> technic

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
server folder so ignore all the technic

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.630 
server folder so ignore all the technic
stuff<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:53.039> imagine<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
stuff in here just imagine this is a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.660 
stuff in here just imagine this is a
normal<00:00:54.059> server<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:56.399> should<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
normal server and this should be a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
normal server and this should be a
folder<00:00:56.850> empty<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.109> called<00:00:58.289> plugins<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
folder empty this is called plugins and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.959 
folder empty this is called plugins and
this<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.969> basically<00:01:00.149> plugins<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.969> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this is basically plugins in so just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
this is basically plugins in so just
drag<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> drop<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:04.199> copy<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> paste<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
drag and drop it in or copy and paste it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.780 
drag and drop it in or copy and paste it
out<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> wherever<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> download<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.790> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
out of wherever you download it to so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
out of wherever you download it to so
that's<00:01:09.210> literally<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.710> I've

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's literally all you have to do I've

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's literally all you have to do I've
had<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> few<00:01:11.549> queries<00:01:12.119> ask<00:01:12.330> people

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
had quite a few queries ask people

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
had quite a few queries ask people
asking<00:01:13.470> me<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.670> actually<00:01:14.670> show<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> do

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
asking me to actually show you how to do

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
asking me to actually show you how to do
this<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.689> trying<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> explain<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this and I'm trying to explain it but

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
this and I'm trying to explain it but
people<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> thought

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
people just don't get it so I thought

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
people just don't get it so I thought
I'd<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> visual<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> few

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I'd do a visual kind of thing so a few

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
I'd do a visual kind of thing so a few
of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> problems<00:01:22.520> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.420> plug-in<00:01:25.170> list<00:01:25.549> they

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of the problems on the plug-in list they

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
of the problems on the plug-in list they
are<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.180> versions<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.080> you've<00:01:28.500> got

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
are all different versions so you've got

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.810 
are all different versions so you've got
to<00:01:28.799> watch<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.700> can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to watch out for this because it can

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.130 
to watch out for this because it can
actually<00:01:30.090> ruin<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.450> server<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> put

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
actually ruin your server if you put

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.380 
actually ruin your server if you put
plug-in<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.140> wrong<00:01:34.140> version<00:01:34.409> or

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
plug-in in and it's a wrong version or

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
plug-in in and it's a wrong version or
it's<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.659> compatible<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.409> your

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it's not compatible with what your

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.149 
it's not compatible with what your
servers<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> basically<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.710> when

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
servers on so basically think about when

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
servers on so basically think about when
did<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.640> server<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> your

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
did you make your server when is your

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.249 
did you make your server when is your
last<00:01:42.840> update<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.880> minecraft<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
last update it on minecraft so if you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
last update it on minecraft so if you
made<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> server<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.040> minecraft<00:01:47.520> 1.2.5<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
made a server on minecraft 1.2.5 and
