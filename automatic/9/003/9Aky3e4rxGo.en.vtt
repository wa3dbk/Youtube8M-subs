play<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.960> isn't<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.619> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
play that this isn't really that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
this could be very overpowered inference
and<00:01:22.500> shot<00:01:22.799> gun<00:01:23.009> mod<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> looks<00:01:23.729> incredibly

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and shot gun mod but it looks incredibly

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600
