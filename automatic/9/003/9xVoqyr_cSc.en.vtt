did<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.470> cooperation<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.610> apple

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
did you have cooperation from an apple

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.000 
did you have cooperation from an apple
computer<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.630> product<00:01:51.869> no<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> did

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
computer to make this product no we did

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.800 
computer to make this product no we did
really<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.549> any<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.540> because

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
really need any to do that because

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
really need any to do that because
strictly<00:01:55.470> speaking<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.490> aftermarket

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
strictly speaking this is an aftermarket

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.790 
strictly speaking this is an aftermarket
product<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.869> so<00:02:00.170> there's<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.320> much<00:02:01.470> as<00:02:01.650> to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
product right so there's not much as to
