00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.120
Hi, I'm the Doctor Bueno and this is
Medicina Clara, your channel of medicine in Internet.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.430
In Medicina Clara, we will explain in a clear, simple and concise  way,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.840
different aspects of medicine that you can not understand clearly.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960
Today we are going to talk about hernias.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.361
Hernias are such a frequent process that everyone wants to know about them,

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:33.820
but in the end when they diagnose you, you see yourself at the operating room table,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.740
many questions that you would have liked to ask your surgeon start to arise.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.980
What will happen to me?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.280
How will the treatment be?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280
Will it hurt?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.120
How is the postoperative going to be?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.320
Am I going to be comfortable?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.070
Am I going to be able to do the same sport?

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.660
Will I be able to work quickly? ...

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.300
We will solve it today.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.000
But ... what is a hernia?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.380
A hernia is a lump that
It appears in one of our body zones.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.220
Usually, this lump appears in the groin or in the navel,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.020
which are the most frequent places of appearance of a hernia.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.030
That lump is no more than our guts squeezing out through a hole.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.979
Imagine that by any of these holes that we have inside our body,

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.439
that are natural, that are prepared so that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.039
many structures go from one side to another,

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.469
It has gotten bigger.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.340
As our  guts grow bigger they see that there is a weakness and they want to go out over there.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.639
In this way, we would have our hole and press.

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:41.310
When this is the case, absolutely nothing happens, we do not have a hernia, but if our hole

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.349
gets bigger for many reasons, such as a

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.909
weakness, such as an effort, coughing, our guts are going

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.960
to squeeze out through that hole and then We, on the outside, are going to notice this bulge.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.599
How do we diagnose a patient having a hernia?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.180
It is not the same to have a hernia in the groin, a hernia in the navel,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.320
having a diaphragmatic hernia, or having a herniated disc,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.319
are totally different things.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.209
We are going to talk about abdominal hernias, that is, those that appear

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.959
in our gut, in our groins.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.890
It will be diagnosed through the surgeon.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.920
The surgeon will simply place us standing, will make us cough and will feel

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.610
that lump and that lump will bring it back in,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.810
with certain maneuvers.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.600
It is a clinical concept.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.200
Usually he does not need any other proof.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.561
Do not ask for it, because it is clearly,

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.420
it is determined that it is a hernia.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.790
If there are doubts, or it is not very clear, or the lump is very small, or is difficult to palpate,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.990
our surgeon will ask for an ultrasound.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.810
That ultrasound will determine if there is a hernia or not.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.480
If it hurts for that reason or it hurts because you have tendonitis, inflammation,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.940
pubalgia, etc ...

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.020
Usually with the clinical diagnosis, that is, with the exploration and with the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.420
questions that your surgeon will ask you, this will determine what is a hernia

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.220
and you
will propose surgical treatment.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.400
But what happens after surgery, does it hurt?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.520
Can you continue doing your activity?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.460
Currently there are two types of interventions, one that is simply sewing that hole

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.460
and the other is to place a mesh.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.380
Most of the processes are with the placement of meshes.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.210
But the operation is not without complications.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.880
They are usually minor complications, increased fluid in the wound,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.780
infection a bit of bleeding, although it may have some major complications such as

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.440
mesh infections or rejection of it.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.580
Do not worry, your doctor will explain it to you,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.260
ask him the  relevant  questions and operate.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.900
This has been Clear Medicine with the Good Doctor.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.380
I hope this video has solved the doubts you had.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.160
Of course, that this explanation does not

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.660
