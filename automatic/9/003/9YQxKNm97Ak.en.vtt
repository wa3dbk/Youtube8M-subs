00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 already me for these all these rewards 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.530
 individual that it seems to me 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.300
 completely artificial it's 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.900
 media because yahia begs you 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.900
 can not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.150
 it's true for a coach for 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.910
 players it's the same it's all the more 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 that it's a team sport so he 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 There is no need to have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.180
 individual rewards that without 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 necessarily subjective good regards 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.010
 up to a crate obviously does it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.780
 that bayern is dominated football 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 European last season thought 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 it's a logical distinction but 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 let's say the title already two champions 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 europe I think this should suffice 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 it's for here and then after it's 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.010
 true that it also has a coach who 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.510
 over the duration anyway 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.090
 was not constant but finally 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 always present as so that's it 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.770
 can in any case reward his career 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.239
 it's good but I think he prefers 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.269
 the title of champion of europe obviously 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.200
 acquired on the ground the the bayern of 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.060
 guardiola this year + more attractive 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.470
 there is more research but hey 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.600
 I 'm not a cashier anyway 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.930
 managed to coexist 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.860
 strong personalities so that's already 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.110
 it's already that I think about sound 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.310
 first merit and then after having known 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.590
 still have a consistent team 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.550
 Here it was know I say it is not 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 that's not what I'm fighting for 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.530
 have references in terms of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.990
 the coach is it's on the job 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.170
 no it's not something that is 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.630
 necessarily 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.630
 mediatized but it's the inspirations 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.930
 are are more what they see there 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.380
 obviously guardiola is one of 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.270
 currently working coaches who 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.330
 are who are interesting in their 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.330
 research
