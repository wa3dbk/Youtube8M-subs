00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.940
 Waiting for the bus 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.490
 Hey! Hey! Wait for me! 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.780
 Stop the bus! Stop the bus! 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.720
 Man, stop the bus! Stop the bus! 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.230
 I can not stop the bus. 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.300
 What? Why? 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700
 In the bus bomb. 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.530
 If the bus goes slower than 50 miles per hour, we will all perish! 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.110
 Just like in that movie? 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.110
 Yeah, only in reality. 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.420
 Wait, does that mean I'm running at 50 miles per hour? 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 Look yourself 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.060
 Holy shit! Well this is pretty fast. 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.110
 Quickly? Are you kidding? You are probably the fastest man in the world! 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.720
 Man, you must help me! What should I do?! What should I do?! 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 Boy, you have a real talent. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.510
 You must set a goal and achieve it. 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 You have your whole life ahead. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 Strive through the thorns to the stars and do not allow anyone to restrain yourself. 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.860
