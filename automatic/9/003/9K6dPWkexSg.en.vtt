00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.049
 mast with a very nice profile 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.200
 the fingerboard profile is also very 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.329
 suitable both to have in stock 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.890

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.010
 how much is squeezed to the sound when 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.660

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.030
