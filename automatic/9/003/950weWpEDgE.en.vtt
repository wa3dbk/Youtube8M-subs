disaster<00:01:56.680> here's<00:01:57.130> what<00:01:57.310> was<00:01:57.490> added<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.090> the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
disaster here's what was added to the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.090 
disaster here's what was added to the
mix<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.690> complexing<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.500> emergency<00:02:00.010> in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
mix and complexing the emergency in

mix and complexing the emergency in
Mexico<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.420> tremendous<00:02:01.870> rainfall<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
Mexico this is tremendous rainfall and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.550 
Mexico this is tremendous rainfall and
as<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.430> now<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:04.240> only<00:02:04.540> change<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.320> lack<00:02:05.530> of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
as of now the only change is the lack of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.130 
as of now the only change is the lack of
an<00:02:05.860> organized<00:02:06.310> storm<00:02:06.730> amidst<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.450> continuing
