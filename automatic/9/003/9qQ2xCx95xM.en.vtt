00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
corner do you have a plan when you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.780 
corner do you have a plan when you
arrive<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.010> cut<00:00:58.220> before<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.550> leave<00:00:58.700> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
arrive this cut before you leave the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.160 
arrive this cut before you leave the
start<00:00:59.030> lines<00:00:59.210> you're<00:00:59.360> trying<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.750> plan<00:00:59.989> you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
start lines you're trying of a plan you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.860 
start lines you're trying of a plan you
go<00:01:00.320> left<00:01:00.560> or<00:01:00.680> right<00:01:00.739> how<00:01:01.100> does<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.280> work<00:01:01.520> Oh

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
go left or right how does that work Oh

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.100 
go left or right how does that work Oh
basically<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.649> tend<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.540> more<00:01:05.540> focus<00:01:05.990> on

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
basically I just tend to more focus on

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.070 
basically I just tend to more focus on
on<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.190> RPM<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.300> know<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.540> cooks<00:01:08.810> whip

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
on the RPM and you know the cooks whip

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.450 
on the RPM and you know the cooks whip
it<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.350> try<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.770> away<00:01:09.920> clean<00:01:10.130> there

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
it and try and get away clean there

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.550 
it and try and get away clean there
after<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:10.850> I'll<00:01:11.600> put<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> plan<00:01:12.140> into<00:01:12.320> place

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
after that I'll put the plan into place

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.650 
after that I'll put the plan into place
if<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:12.979> have<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.190> good<00:01:13.369> start<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:13.940> you<00:01:14.540> know

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
if I have a good start then you know

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.990 
if I have a good start then you know
general<00:01:15.080> they'll<00:01:15.200> be

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480 

toby<00:01:24.000> baby<00:01:24.210> stop<00:01:24.510> here<00:01:24.720> between<00:01:25.410> 4<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.100> 10<00:01:26.190> 5

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
toby baby stop here between 4 and 10 5

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.610 
toby baby stop here between 4 and 10 5
why're<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.870> significance<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
why're you what significance is this

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.170 
why're you what significance is this
corner<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.010> for<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.580> corner<00:01:30.030> it's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
corner have for you this corner it's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
corner have for you this corner it's
very<00:01:30.360> very<00:01:30.810> fast<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.040> honest<00:01:32.250> it's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
very very fast and to be honest it's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
very very fast and to be honest it's
quite<00:01:32.700> easy<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> lot<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> time<00:01:33.780> here

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
quite easy to make a lot of time here

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.290 
quite easy to make a lot of time here
it's<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.680> carrying<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> speed

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
it's all about carrying a lot of speed

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.840 
it's all about carrying a lot of speed
through<00:01:36.630> turn<00:01:36.900> four<00:01:37.460> obviously<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
through turn four obviously from the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.250 
through turn four obviously from the
approach<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.240> turn<00:01:39.540> three<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.080> uphill

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
approach from turn three it's all uphill

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.680 
approach from turn three it's all uphill
so<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.610> carry<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> speed<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
so if you can carry the speed up the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.840 
so if you can carry the speed up the
hill<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.160> confidence<00:01:44.400> in<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hill and have a lot of confidence in you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840 
hill and have a lot of confidence in you
come<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:46.160> carry<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
come and you can really carry a lot of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
come and you can really carry a lot of
speed<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.930> couple<00:01:49.410> attempts<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
speed here make up a couple attempts you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.130 
speed here make up a couple attempts you
know<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.149> trail<00:01:51.479> braking<00:01:51.960> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
know and it's all on trail braking if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
know and it's all on trail braking if
you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.470> pull<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:52.800> into<00:01:53.220> turn<00:01:53.399> five<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you can pull it down into turn five I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:04.430 
you can pull it down into turn five I
think<00:01:54.899> he<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.200> quite<00:01:55.940> easy<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> an

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
think he is quite easy this is an

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.630 
think he is quite easy this is an
interesting<00:02:04.619> corner<00:02:04.979> maybe<00:02:05.220> we<00:02:05.340> come<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
interesting corner maybe we come off a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.040 
interesting corner maybe we come off a
blind<00:02:05.970> race<00:02:06.270> you've<00:02:06.479> got<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
blind race you've got to be on the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410 
blind race you've got to be on the
brakes<00:02:07.289> before<00:02:07.440> any<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.160> hoses<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
brakes before any of this hoses do you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
brakes before any of this hoses do you

different changes of grip and you know

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.820 
different changes of grip and you know
it's<00:04:12.070> proven<00:04:12.840> let's<00:04:13.840> say<00:04:14.020> very<00:04:14.320> well<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:14.770> is

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
it's proven let's say very well for is

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.830 
it's proven let's say very well for is
in<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.340> past<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:16.150> course<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.480> in<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.690> good

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
in the past of course is in a good

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.630 
in the past of course is in a good
position<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.820> for<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> races<00:04:19.299> but<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.640> can't
