wanted to see how bad it was so I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.419 
wanted to see how bad it was so I
quickly<00:00:27.900> sanded<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.980> actually<00:00:29.250> not

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
quickly sanded it and it's actually not

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.120 
quickly sanded it and it's actually not
too<00:00:29.609> bad<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.740> gets<00:00:31.890> pretty

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
too bad but you can see it gets pretty

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.479 
too bad but you can see it gets pretty
bad<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:35.010> want<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.340> sure

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
bad back here and I want to make sure

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
bad back here and I want to make sure
that<00:00:35.700> doesn't<00:00:35.940> rust<00:00:36.210> any<00:00:36.450> more<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.260> thing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that doesn't rust any more and one thing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.150 
that doesn't rust any more and one thing
that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.620> noticed<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:39.110> could<00:00:40.110> turn<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> which

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that I noticed I could turn this which

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.290 
that I noticed I could turn this which
means<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:42.710> my<00:00:43.710> exhaust<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.850> right

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
means that my exhaust over here right

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
means that my exhaust over here right
there<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:46.579> probably<00:00:47.750> loose<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> need<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
there is probably loose and I need to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
there is probably loose and I need to
tighten<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.250> probably<00:00:50.430> loose

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
tighten it and it's probably loose

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
tighten it and it's probably loose
because<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> vibration<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.840> rust<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> want

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because the vibration and rust so I want

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.900 
because the vibration and rust so I want
to<00:00:53.730> spray<00:00:54.239> paint<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.039> before<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.309> start

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

more as well as when it alcohol

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.840 
more as well as when it alcohol
evaporates<00:02:49.880> very<00:02:49.910> quickly<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.470> it'll<00:02:51.709> also

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
evaporates very quickly so it'll also

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.509

now this you could get on here pretty
thick<00:04:08.480> it's<00:04:08.959> not<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.170> big<00:04:09.379> deal<00:04:09.849> because<00:04:10.849> it's

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
thick it's not a big deal because it's

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.879 
thick it's not a big deal because it's
just<00:04:11.359> gonna<00:04:11.450> bake<00:04:11.750> on<00:04:14.019> good<00:04:15.019> now<00:04:15.349> let<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.590> drive

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
just gonna bake on good now let it drive

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.670 
just gonna bake on good now let it drive
for<00:04:16.220> an<00:04:16.459> hour<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:19.430> looks<00:04:19.639> really<00:04:19.820> good<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.989> I

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
for an hour that looks really good and I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200 
for an hour that looks really good and I
think<00:04:21.889> when<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.100> dries<00:04:22.430> it'll<00:04:22.669> come<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:22.940> even

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
think when it dries it'll come out even

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.480 
think when it dries it'll come out even
nicer<00:04:24.520> well<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:26.210> came<00:04:26.419> out<00:04:26.599> really<00:04:26.840> nice

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
really close you get a good idea of if

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.870

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
you want it to get really smooth you

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.939 
you want it to get really smooth you
have<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.210> sand<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.539> really<00:04:32.810> well<00:04:32.990> mine<00:04:33.800> has

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
have to sand it really well mine has

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.499 
have to sand it really well mine has
like<00:04:34.099> little<00:04:34.250> dimples<00:04:34.729> in<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.000> which<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.210> fine

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
like little dimples in it which is fine

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.320 
like little dimples in it which is fine
it<00:04:35.660> was<00:04:35.750> just<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.080> prevent<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.860> from<00:04:36.889> rusting

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
it was just to prevent it from rusting

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.120 
it was just to prevent it from rusting
but<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:39.050> inside<00:04:39.349> still<00:04:39.560> drying<00:04:39.830> just<00:04:40.070> a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
but the inside still drying just a

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.200 
but the inside still drying just a
little<00:04:40.340> bit<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.220> outside<00:04:43.370> is<00:04:43.610> pretty

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
little bit but the outside is pretty

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.909 
little bit but the outside is pretty
much<00:04:44.389> dry<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:44.810> still<00:04:45.349> drying<00:04:45.590> up<00:04:45.740> there<00:04:45.889> a

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
much dry it's still drying up there a

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.890 
much dry it's still drying up there a
little<00:04:46.039> bit<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.520> I'm<00:04:47.210> gonna<00:04:47.300> finish<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:47.720> rest

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
little bit and I'm gonna finish the rest

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.719 
little bit and I'm gonna finish the rest
of<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.050> exhaust<00:04:48.349> so<00:04:49.070> I'll<00:04:49.280> probably<00:04:49.460> add

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
of the exhaust so I'll probably add

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.400 
of the exhaust so I'll probably add
another<00:04:49.970> coat<00:04:50.270> as<00:04:50.830> well<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.400> that's<00:04:52.610> how<00:04:52.759> you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
another coat as well but that's how you

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.570 
another coat as well but that's how you
spray-paint<00:04:54.410> your<00:04:54.470> exhaust<00:04:54.889> nice<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.430> easy

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
spray-paint your exhaust nice and easy

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.779

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.060 
to do that comes out pretty nice I have
to<00:04:58.820> say<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.810> protects<00:05:00.199> it<00:05:00.409> and<00:05:00.500> makes<00:05:00.590> it

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
to say so it protects it and makes it

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.740
