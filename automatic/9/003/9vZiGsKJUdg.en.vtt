00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
890 D probe now I already did unboxings

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.440 
890 D probe now I already did unboxings
of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> GTD<00:00:07.710> pro<00:00:08.099> as<00:00:08.309> well<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> GTD<00:00:09.150> pro

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.820 
USB 3 so this is without the G which
actually<00:00:13.019> makes<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.349> better

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830

anything<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.310> used<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
anything like that we used to see that a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670 
anything like that we used to see that a
lot<00:02:27.239> where<00:02:27.480> there's<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.110> everything

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
lot where there's just like everything

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.229 
lot where there's just like everything
is<00:02:28.830> sort<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.099> one<00:02:29.280> color<00:02:29.519> except<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.120> know

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
is sort of one color except you know

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.479 
is sort of one color except you know
this<00:02:30.720> dim<00:02:31.019> slot<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.560> yellow<00:02:32.069> because<00:02:32.430> yellow

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
this dim slot is yellow because yellow

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.400 
this dim slot is yellow because yellow
plastic<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.420> cheaper<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.840> day<00:02:33.989> or<00:02:34.110> whatever

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
plastic was cheaper that day or whatever

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
plastic was cheaper that day or whatever
it's<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.550> nice<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.910> sharp<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.599> here

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's really nice really sharp up here

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's really nice really sharp up here
we've<00:02:36.989> got<00:02:37.140> our<00:02:37.200> eight<00:02:37.440> pin<00:02:37.650> power<00:02:37.830> connector

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
we've got our eight pin power connector

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.400 
we've got our eight pin power connector
so<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.690> know<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> lot<00:02:40.380> of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
so this is you know I get a lot of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.590 
so this is you know I get a lot of
questions<00:02:40.800> about<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.790> fact<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.180> one

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
questions about this the fact that one

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.080 
questions about this the fact that one
side<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.930> covered<00:02:43.560> means<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.519> if<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.790> only

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
side is covered means that if you only

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300 
side is covered means that if you only
have<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.600> four<00:02:46.049> pin<00:02:46.319> power<00:02:46.530> connector<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.190> your

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
have a four pin power connector on your

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
have a four pin power connector on your
power<00:02:47.489> supply<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.390> plug<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> into<00:02:48.900> these<00:02:49.200> ones

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
power supply you plug it into these ones

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.380 
power supply you plug it into these ones
if<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.310> an<00:02:50.730> eight<00:02:50.850> pin<00:02:51.060> power<00:02:51.239> connector

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
if you have an eight pin power connector

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.630 
if you have an eight pin power connector
you<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.440> off<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.799> cover<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.190> plug<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.489> into

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you take off this cover and plug it into

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
you take off this cover and plug it into
the<00:02:53.819> whole<00:02:53.970> thing<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:54.989> there's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the whole thing so you can see there's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.710 
the whole thing so you can see there's
eight<00:02:55.470> pins<00:02:55.680> under<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.360> why

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
eight pins under there so that is why

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.180 
eight pins under there so that is why
that<00:02:57.750> covers<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.130> you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that covers on there just so that you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
that covers on there just so that you
don't<00:02:59.220> accidentally<00:02:59.940> try<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.269> plug<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.450> four

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
don't accidentally try and plug a four

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.710 
don't accidentally try and plug a four
pin<00:03:00.870> into<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.260> side<00:03:01.819> okay<00:03:02.819> then<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.390> our

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
pin into this side okay then we have our

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
pin into this side okay then we have our
m3<00:03:04.200> CPU<00:03:04.590> socket<00:03:04.980> that's<00:03:05.160> where<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.400> get

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
m3 CPU socket that's where you get

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.160 
m3 CPU socket that's where you get
support<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.690> chips<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.019> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
support for all of the chips that I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.900 
support for all of the chips that I
outlined<00:03:07.530> before<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.430> support<00:03:08.790> for

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
outlined before you have support for

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.720 
outlined before you have support for
dual<00:03:09.120> channel<00:03:09.480> ddr3<00:03:09.630> memory<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.340> uses<00:03:11.700> a

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
here's your North Bridge it's actually

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.659 
here's your North Bridge it's actually
connected<00:04:43.750> by<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.080> heat<00:04:44.380> pipe<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> MOSFET

cooler<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.360> don't<00:04:46.510> know<00:04:46.570> if<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.810> can<00:04:46.960> see

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
cooler so I don't know if you can see

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.290 
cooler so I don't know if you can see
that<00:04:47.320> in<00:04:47.440> there<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.280> uses<00:04:48.760> what<00:04:49.000> someone

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
that in there and this uses what someone

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.170 
that in there and this uses what someone
suggested<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.020> me<00:04:50.169> is<00:04:50.350> more<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.550> tree<00:04:51.940> than

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
suggested to me is more like a tree than

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.060 
suggested to me is more like a tree than
anything<00:04:52.389> else<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:52.840> uses<00:04:53.260> their<00:04:53.410> tree<00:04:53.740> style

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
anything else that uses their tree style

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.550 
anything else that uses their tree style
of<00:04:54.310> heatsink<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:56.229> just

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
of heatsink that I really like it's just

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.070 
of heatsink that I really like it's just
kind<00:04:56.949> of<00:04:57.039> cool-looking<00:04:57.850> let's<00:04:58.630> look<00:04:58.810> at<00:04:58.930> that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
kind of cool-looking let's look at that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.480 
kind of cool-looking let's look at that
from<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.350> couple<00:04:59.380> different<00:04:59.889> angles<00:04:59.979> camera

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
from a couple different angles camera

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.890 
from a couple different angles camera
man<00:05:00.639> always<00:05:00.880> appreciates<00:05:01.389> this<00:05:01.570> kind<00:05:01.810> of

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
man always appreciates this kind of

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.689 
man always appreciates this kind of
stuff<00:05:02.139> where<00:05:02.410> it's<00:05:02.530> like<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.979> know<00:05:03.100> more

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
stuff where it's like you know more

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.210 
stuff where it's like you know more
about<00:05:03.789> aesthetics<00:05:04.479> than<00:05:04.720> actual<00:05:05.229> performance

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
about aesthetics than actual performance

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.219 
about aesthetics than actual performance
and<00:05:06.490> I'm<00:05:06.760> starting<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.419> get<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.840> way<00:05:07.990> myself

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
and I'm starting to get that way myself

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.159 
and I'm starting to get that way myself
to<00:05:08.650> be<00:05:08.740> perfectly<00:05:09.160> honest<00:05:09.870> let<00:05:10.870> me<00:05:10.960> see<00:05:11.110> if

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
to be perfectly honest let me see if

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.060 
to be perfectly honest let me see if
there's<00:05:11.289> anything<00:05:11.530> else<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.010> should

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
there's anything else that I should

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.680 
there's anything else that I should
really<00:05:12.460> tell<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:12.789> about<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.330> board

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
really tell you about on this board

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.379 
really tell you about on this board
while<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:13.930> camera<00:05:14.320> man<00:05:14.440> oh<00:05:14.940> yeah<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:15.970> hybrid

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
while the camera man oh yeah a hybrid

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.790 
while the camera man oh yeah a hybrid
technology<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:19.050> think<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:20.320> something<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.620> do

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
technology I think it's something to do

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.850 
technology I think it's something to do
with<00:05:20.830> power<00:05:21.100> savings<00:05:21.610> actually<00:05:22.090> ok<00:05:23.020> well

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
with power savings actually ok well

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.080 
with power savings actually ok well
let's<00:05:24.280> have<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.460> look<00:05:24.490> at<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:24.760> back<00:05:24.880> of<00:05:24.910> the
