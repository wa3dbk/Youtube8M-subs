00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:06.645
Hello &amp; Welcome to Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:11.405
Today's request is based on the feedback I have got from children.

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:18.524
They have asked me to show a recipe which does 
 not requires the gas, a sandwich if possible?

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:24.245
Of course I will show the recipe. The sandwich which I am going to make is called Checkmate Sandwiches. 

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:26.283
But to know how-to make it, keep watching Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.205
Let's have a look at the ingredients required for making these sandwiches. 

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:42.924
White bread and brown bread slices, with the edges cut. 1 cube grated cheese, 1/2 tsp crushed 
 black pepper powder, 1/2 tsp crushed mustard, salt and 3-4 tbsp butter.   

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:51.525
Now, I will start with making the butter mixture which will be applied on all the bread slices. 

00:00:56.217 --> 00:01:18.444
In a bowl, add 4-5 tbsp butter, 1 cube grated cheese, 1/2 tsp black pepper powder, 1/2 tsp crushed mustard and salt as per taste (keeping in mind that cheese has salt).    

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:21.878
Now mix all these ingredients well together. 

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:29.676
The mixture is ready. Butter, cheese, crushed mustard, black pepper powder and salt has gone into making this mixture.    

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:41.410
You can also make this mixture with fresh cream, malai or hung curd. Now that the mixture is ready, let's apply it to the bread slices.   

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:46.080
When making the sandwiches, take a slice of brown bread and white bread.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:54.640
I am going to apply this mixture on both the slices but to get the checkered look, if you're starting with white bread, the next slice should be brown.  

00:01:55.032 --> 00:02:02.290
In this way, you put 1 slice on top of the other. If you start with white, the 6th slice on top should be brown.  

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:05.680
So I am going to start applying the butter mixture on the bread slices.  

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:18.560
I have put the butter mixture on to the bread slices. Put a brown bread slice on top. Apply the mixture again which consists of black pepper, crushed mustard.   

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:27.910
It has cheese as well. Put a slice of white bread, I 
 started with white and ended up with brown.  

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:34.080
This is exactly how the layers need to look, white-brown-white-brown and in the end in brown.  

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:41.280
Which means it's white down and brown on top. I am going to put the other sandwich the same way and show you how-to cut it.  

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:51.280
Make precisely 3 parts of the sandwich. In the centre of each part, apply the butter mixture
again.  

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.120
Then turn the 2 part upside down and put it 
 on the buttered side, the white part on top.

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:05.130
Apply the butter mixture once again on the cut portion. 

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:11.240
I am applying this mixture on the cut portions because it will help bind the bread slices together. 

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:20.890
So, look at the placement. There is portion of the brown bread, with the white part in the centre and ends again with the brown bread. 

00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:29.800
Since I was holding to standing, I have turned 
 it and now will cut it. 

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:47.800
Now I am cutting it. These are the Checkmate Sandwiches which look like a chessboard-1 black, 
 1 white, in this case 1 brown and 1 white.    

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:52.640
The design has come out beautifully. My children are very happy.

00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:56.320
They have all called up one another to subscribe to India Food Network. 

00:03:56.742 --> 00:04:11.360
And if you'll have any variations because you'll send me good ideas, then do send in your
feedback, ill be very happy. Till then keep watching Archana's Rasoi!
