00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.820
There's a concept in computing,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.080
About a growth that's unrestrained

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.340
The exponential rate of computer processing means all of them computers have brains

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.860
Super intelligent nano-machines,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.920
Self aware by 2045,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.380
Either civilization is in total peace or none of us'll be alive

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.460
Well I hope the robots are nice,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.560
A benevolent technology

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.460
If I have to report to a robot boss

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.040
Well I wanna few things for me...

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.700
...I wanna have

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.260
Robot beer

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
That autopours in my mouth

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.660
I wanna have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.280
A robot football coach

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.980
To figure my fantasy drafts out

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.540
I wanna have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.960
A robot lawn

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.040
To ride my robot mower on

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.880
The dawn of the singularity is the age for which I Iong

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.240
If we can have every little thing

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.320
Robots at our beckon call

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.320
Then I want one robot to keep track of the remote...

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
...And another one to scratch my balls

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.520
I wanna have

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.080
Robot beer

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.400
That autopours in my mouth

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.980
I wanna have

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.220
A robot football coach, to figure my fantasy drafts out

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.260
I wanna have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.180
A robot wife

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.580
To automatically take my last name

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
I long for the singularity

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.360
As long as everything stays pretty much the same

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.180
Elon Musk
The fella from Tesla thinks

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.940
The singularity's a bad scene

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.120
But Kurt Sloan and Stephen Hawking both agree

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.980
It is the dawn of the spiritual machine

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400
Now I don't give a shit about that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.200
If life is real or a digital facade

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.080
Hell the robots can have all heaven and earth

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.100
As long as they worship my God...

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.760
...Cuz I just wanna have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.000
A robot Nascar runnin' on

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.220
Robot gas

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.160
And if that race gets a little too tedious

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.040
I can program a robot crash

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.980
I wanna have

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.600
A robot rifle

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
So I can shoot at robot game

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.140
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.060
Beer.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.960
I long for the singularity as long as everything stays pretty much the same...

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220
...Where's my autobeer?
