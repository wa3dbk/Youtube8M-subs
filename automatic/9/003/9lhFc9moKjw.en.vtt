00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.000
 five months and the age where your child will be 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.970
 sends a signal he is able to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 to take something by hand and to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.710
 bring to your mouth 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.449
 so he is able to suck a crust 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.180
 of bread a biscuit 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.680
 it's really the signal that baby and 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.840
 can open the panel of these foods 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 if he is within you will continue the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 breast milk with no other report than 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 little sus- hostage of your bread crust 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 a special baby biscuit 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 attention by staying next to him and in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.489
 only taking baby biscuits 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 because a piece could clog 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 his larynx 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 so it can happen even when the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.829
 cookie dough is really 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.250
 specially made for him you can 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.280
 also if baby and bottle-feeding continue 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.810
 diversify a little his palate the meat 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 can be introduced 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 then it will be green white meat 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 Vaud chicken or meat 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.299
 red under no circumstances do you do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.509
 grilling with oil you the priest to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.600
 the steam and she will be well cooked not to 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.939
 half raw it's very important for a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.220
 very small to introduce only the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.829
 fresh meat will have warned you 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 butcher that it's especially for 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.380
 your baby you buy this piece 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 of meat 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.720
 and then you can also use the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 little pots you have to know that the pots 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.270
 for babies are made with food 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.880
 extremely controlled meat in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.030
 particular is subject to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 total traceability and I would say that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
 contrary to what we can believe 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 it is the most organic diet 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.399
 organic ea for a baby when he is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.740
 very small in addition the mixture the way 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.229
 to liquefy the little pots and the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.510
 meat that is included allows baby 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.879
 do not have a little lumps that the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.940
 would then make phobic pieces 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.890
 we will also have meal time 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.920
 and what does meat bring to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.100
 your baby to share the taste is the door 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.960
 baby iron needs to make it necessary 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.050
 know that many babies at 10 months 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.880
 lack of iron because you are 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.850
 missed during your pregnancy 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.220
 here you continue to breastfeed your baby 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.560
 do not hesitate to ask your doctor 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.890
 to make him and vitamins for you 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.050
 even 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.030
 it's finally the most 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.030
 natural to bring to bb
