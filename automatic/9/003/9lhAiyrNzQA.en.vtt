 lightweight for daytime makeup 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.020
 tonal basis 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.359
 we also apply along massage lines 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 special brush for tones not 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.509
 stretching the skin and completely overlapping 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 his face so that there is not 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.009
 shaded non- overlapped areas 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.909
 carefully shade the tonal basis 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.039
 so that it does not remain a mask and not 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.140
 clear boundaries and so where we 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.780
 starts me growing hair by others 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.039
 of blood 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.879
 carefully shade the tonal basis 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.790
 to get the foundation between the heads 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.190
 on the horns and that there was no clear 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 borders candy 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.329
 ends therefore brush stretch 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.329
 tone completely 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.599
 To the borders of Lithuania, an excess of tonal 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.180
 bases can also be wetted with sponge and 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.680
 plus additionally shade what u 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.170
 we were not dried 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.550
 youtube 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.950
 blooming movements in any way 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.540
 We do not stretch and rub the letter was 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.330
 we can erase the tonal basis 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.330
 therefore, as if we knock down the skin tone 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.030
 those areas that are not 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.420
 overlapped this area around the eyes like 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.930
 the rule is a darker color by tone and 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.730
 some minor defects on the face we can 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.730
 concealer override extra 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.510
 special brush and loose light 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.510
 layer we overlap 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.600
 dark areas also dotted mask 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.710
 because you need to block 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.930
 also we can walk 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.380
 stamps them with movements to remove all 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 superfluous 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.959
 after that we have to powder 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 tonal basis 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.829
 pass the haze on the face and fix 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.829
 fact that he kept a low profile during the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.759
 and 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.550
 recruit on powder brushes loose 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.009
 powder and also light movements 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.789
 massage lines 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:41.680
 slightly dusting the face becomes 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.370
 matte and finally flattened 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 common Home 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.910
 do not forget to powder all the details of the face 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.470
 otherwise we have a tonal basis 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.790
 affect during the day where we are 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:08.960
 forget her powder eye area 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.660
 especially since you have it 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.580
 mimic wrinkles in which tons and 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.580
 concealer and most often rolls down 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:28.940
 liking and corners of the lips in this way 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.560
 we put tonal foundation on face 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.960
 prepare your face for further 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.000
 makeup application 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.729
 additionally you can refresh your face 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.970
 give it shine shimmering shining 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.199
 textures if you like it either 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.639
 highlighter highlighter at us is applied on 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.550
 zones under the eyes 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:54.180
 over cheekbones here you can put a little 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.789
 highlighter on forehead on back of nose and over 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.479
 upper lip so we 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.949
 emphasize 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.949
 natural face volume 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.830
 but it must be done very carefully for 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.840
 so that her face does not look 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.210
 bold also in order to emphasize 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.740
 natural relief and face and so she 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.240
 didn't look flat we can 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.240
 use bran ass which 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.440
 emphasize the natural and shadows on the face 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.440
 the area under the Urals 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.210
 so also with the help of branes but we can 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:38.480
 give a light tan to your face 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.480
 so it doesn't look too pale 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.460
 as a rule, cheekbones on the face are easy to read 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.460
 they can be found but if 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:56.660
 those where we have a zone under the cheekbones 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.510
 you can pull in your cheeks a little 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.930
 where we form 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.430
 natural theme we put brother 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.560
 also we have to go over the face oval 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.150
 in order to outline something draws 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.460
 face and make it more expressive 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.990
 so that it is separated from the neck visually and 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.590
 plus we make it easy 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.590
 correction 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.259
 so we prepared meters 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:26.439
 applied makeup I can now 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.830
 make out eyebrows and make any scheme 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.749
 eye makeup 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.749
