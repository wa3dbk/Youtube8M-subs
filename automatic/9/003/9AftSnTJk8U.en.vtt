00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
another cannon baller see we can get

another cannon baller see we can get
this<00:00:18.420> bike<00:00:18.660> running<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.859> here

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
this bike running we just got it here

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
this bike running we just got it here
first<00:00:21.330> thing<00:00:21.570> Dave's<00:00:21.840> doing<00:00:22.109> obviously<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
first thing Dave's doing obviously is

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.790 
first thing Dave's doing obviously is
checking<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> tire<00:00:23.670> pressure<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
checking the tire pressure you really

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.290 
checking the tire pressure you really
don't<00:00:25.980> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.369> those<00:00:26.490> clinchers<00:00:27.060> let

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
don't want to have those clinchers let

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.000 
don't want to have those clinchers let
go<00:00:27.740> right<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:33.649> not<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:34.890> idea

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
go right there not a good idea

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
go right there not a good idea
especially<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.880> clinchers<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.170> pump<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> little

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
especially on clinchers so pump a little

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.869 
especially on clinchers so pump a little
air<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> those<00:00:38.129> tires<00:00:38.899> get<00:00:39.899> them<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.879> level

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
air in those tires get them up to level

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.790 
air in those tires get them up to level
on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.390> clincher<00:00:42.809> tires<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.620> than

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
on the clincher tires more so than

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
on the clincher tires more so than
modern<00:00:44.129> tires<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.600> tire<00:00:45.840> pressure<00:00:46.200> drops

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
modern tires if the tire pressure drops

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
modern tires if the tire pressure drops
too<00:00:46.829> far<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.579> come<00:00:47.910> right

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
too far they will actually come right

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
too far they will actually come right
off<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> rim<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> good<00:00:49.860> idea<00:00:49.980> especially

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
off the rim not a good idea especially

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.110 
off the rim not a good idea especially
when<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:50.940> riding<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.510> road<00:00:53.030> now<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
when you're riding down the road now the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.889 
when you're riding down the road now the
bike<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.980> 55<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.940> crack

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bike is up there we go that 55 but crack

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
bike is up there we go that 55 but crack
and<00:00:58.379> we're<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.680> scary<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.059> them

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and we're a little scary and had them

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.399 
and we're a little scary and had them
blow<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.660> face<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:02.719> have<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> happen

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
blow up in my face and have that happen

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
blow up in my face and have that happen
all<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.830> we'll<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.880> enough<00:01:06.090> air<00:01:06.299> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
all right we'll just have enough air in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
all right we'll just have enough air in
there<00:01:06.600> maybe<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> ride<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.460> we

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
there maybe to take it for a ride if we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.830 
there maybe to take it for a ride if we
get<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.210> okay

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
get it going okay

get it going okay
and<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:11.520> bikes<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.450> original

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and this bikes really pretty original

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
and this bikes really pretty original
and<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.200> correct<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.310> obvious<00:01:14.520> thing

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and pretty correct the one obvious thing

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
and pretty correct the one obvious thing
that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> noticed<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.680> carburetor

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that we have noticed is the carburetor

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.600 
that we have noticed is the carburetor
is<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> newer<00:01:18.680> blinker<00:01:19.680> diesel<00:01:20.100> incurred<00:01:20.369> isn't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
is a newer blinker diesel incurred isn't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.020 
is a newer blinker diesel incurred isn't
it<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> carburetor<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> Laker

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
it make a carburetor that it's a Laker

it make a carburetor that it's a Laker
the<00:01:24.030> 15<00:01:24.780> car<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.170> much<00:01:25.350> smaller<00:01:25.650> than<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
the 15 car was much smaller than that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.590 
the 15 car was much smaller than that
but<00:01:27.030> original<00:01:27.659> paint<00:01:27.930> bikes<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.619> cool

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.990 

and<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:32.619> headlight<00:01:33.040> day<00:01:33.280> just<00:01:33.549> put<00:01:33.729> on<00:01:33.820> he's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
and the headlight day just put on he's

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.580 
and the headlight day just put on he's
fitting<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.540> or<00:01:34.750> actually<00:01:35.110> he's<00:01:35.200> gonna<00:01:35.290> run<00:01:35.500> it

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
fitting it or actually he's gonna run it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.960 
fitting it or actually he's gonna run it
on<00:01:35.680> his<00:01:35.830> own<00:01:35.920> bike<00:01:36.220> but<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.520> does<00:01:36.670> look<00:01:36.850> pretty

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
on his own bike but it does look pretty

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
on his own bike but it does look pretty
cool<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.540> there

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
here we got the oil out and then we'll

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
here we got the oil out and then we'll
put<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:51.799> better<00:01:52.799> crank<00:01:53.100> her<00:01:53.250> up

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
put it up better crank her up

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.500 
put it up better crank her up
we<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:54.000> freeze

the<00:02:25.180> balls<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.930> plunger<00:02:26.560> system<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.240> tank

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the balls the plunger system in the tank

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.590 
the balls the plunger system in the tank
this<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.660> very<00:02:28.990> rudimentary<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:30.040> 1915<00:02:30.850> it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
this is very rudimentary for 1915 it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.060 
this is very rudimentary for 1915 it
just<00:02:31.780> balls<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.200> spring<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.680> when<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.860> bikes

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
just balls in spring so when the bikes

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.370 
just balls in spring so when the bikes
it's<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.730> four<00:02:33.940> quarts<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.360> oil<00:02:34.540> 3nf<00:02:35.050> quartz

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
it's the four quarts of oil 3nf quartz

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.920 
it's the four quarts of oil 3nf quartz
usually<00:02:36.190> ends<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> engine<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.300> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
usually ends up in the engine and you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.260 
usually ends up in the engine and you
can't<00:02:38.230> start<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:38.920> first<00:02:39.400> process<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.120> to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
can't start it so first process is to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.390 
can't start it so first process is to
get<00:02:40.390> all<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.690> oil<00:02:40.870> out<00:02:41.170> take<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> couple<00:02:42.250> of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
get all that oil out take a couple of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640 
get all that oil out take a couple of
minutes<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:43.030> make<00:02:43.210> sure<00:02:43.240> there's<00:02:43.690> nothing<00:02:44.530> in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
minutes to make sure there's nothing in

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.080 
minutes to make sure there's nothing in
there<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.010> then<00:02:45.100> we'll<00:02:45.250> pump<00:02:45.490> about<00:02:45.760> three

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
there and then we'll pump about three

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.090 
there and then we'll pump about three
and<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.240> half<00:02:46.390> four<00:02:46.690> ounces<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.110> oil<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
and a half four ounces of oil in it so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770 
and a half four ounces of oil in it so
it's<00:02:48.220> similar<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.820> like<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.150> old<00:02:49.270> pan<00:02:49.510> heads

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
it's similar to like the old pan heads

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.030 
it's similar to like the old pan heads
and<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.990> knuckle<00:02:50.320> heads<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.800> just<00:02:50.950> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and the knuckle heads that it's just a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.460 
and the knuckle heads that it's just a
ball<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.550> spring<00:02:51.970> simple<00:02:52.840> as<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.350> as

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
ball in a spring simple as that and as

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.230 
ball in a spring simple as that and as
soon<00:02:53.710> as<00:02:53.740> they<00:02:54.010> wear<00:02:54.340> which<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.820> do<00:02:54.880> over

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
soon as they wear which they do over

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240 
soon as they wear which they do over
time<00:02:55.270> then<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.050> oil<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.680> goes<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.220> past

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
time then the oil just goes right past

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.000 
time then the oil just goes right past
where<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:58.590> goes<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.780> 1915<00:03:02.380> technology<00:03:02.950> is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
where it just goes to 1915 technology is

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.550 
where it just goes to 1915 technology is
probably<00:03:03.280> 1314<00:03:04.240> drawing<00:03:04.660> or<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> technology

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
probably 1314 drawing or a technology

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.670 
probably 1314 drawing or a technology
that<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.730> put<00:03:07.090> into<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.540> motorcycle<00:03:07.840> two

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
that got put into the motorcycle two

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.650 
that got put into the motorcycle two
years<00:03:08.920> later<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.610> they<00:03:10.209> kept<00:03:10.480> that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
years later and they kept that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.190 
years later and they kept that
technology<00:03:11.200> really<00:03:11.350> up<00:03:11.590> until<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:13.030> late<00:03:13.450> VLS

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
technology really up until the late VLS

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.230 
technology really up until the late VLS
it's<00:03:15.040> still<00:03:15.310> dripping<00:03:15.520> out<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:16.030> that's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
it's still dripping out there that's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.240 
it's still dripping out there that's
just<00:03:17.190> doesn't<00:03:18.190> look<00:03:18.280> too<00:03:18.520> bad<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.980> tank

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
just doesn't look too bad and the tank

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.699 
just doesn't look too bad and the tank
looks<00:03:24.489> like<00:03:24.670> it's<00:03:24.820> probably<00:03:25.300> empty<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.590> if

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
looks like it's probably empty so if

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.710 
looks like it's probably empty so if
there<00:03:26.890> was<00:03:27.010> only<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.580> half<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.060> quart<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.570> then

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
there was only a half a quart in it then

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.090 
there was only a half a quart in it then
you'd<00:03:28.900> only<00:03:28.989> end<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.380> with<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> half<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.830> quart

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
you'd only end up with a half a quart

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.160 
you'd only end up with a half a quart
down<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> motor<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> tank<00:03:31.989> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
down in the motor but if the tank it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.530 
down in the motor but if the tank it
three<00:03:32.410> quarts<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.770> oil<00:03:32.980> after<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.910> year<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.330> ends

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
three quarts of oil after a year it ends

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.750 
three quarts of oil after a year it ends
up<00:03:34.630> that's<00:03:35.020> assuming<00:03:35.860> all<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.160> oil<00:03:36.340> goes<00:03:36.610> out

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
up that's assuming all the oil goes out

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.500 
up that's assuming all the oil goes out
of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.940> tank<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.330> down<00:03:37.540> into<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> sump

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
of the tank and down into the sump

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.400 
of the tank and down into the sump
doesn't<00:03:40.510> look<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.720> there's<00:03:40.900> too<00:03:41.050> much<00:03:41.170> in

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
doesn't look like there's too much in

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.280 
doesn't look like there's too much in
there<00:03:42.330> okay<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:43.390> what<00:03:43.720> we're<00:03:43.870> gonna<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.170> is

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
there okay so what we're gonna do is

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.900 
there okay so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:44.410> gonna<00:03:44.470> continue<00:03:44.800> draining<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.700> oil

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
we're gonna continue draining the oil

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
we're gonna continue draining the oil
out<00:03:46.180> until<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.780> dry<00:03:47.020> we'll<00:03:47.920> put<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> little

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
out until it's dry we'll put a little

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.890 
out until it's dry we'll put a little
more<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.090> then<00:03:49.180> pump<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.570> shot<00:03:49.780> or

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
more in there and then pump a shot or

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.990 
more in there and then pump a shot or
two<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.500> see<00:03:51.160> if<00:03:51.220> we<00:03:51.310> get<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.580> old<00:03:51.790> girl
