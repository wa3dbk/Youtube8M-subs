yards<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.820> almost<00:01:00.030> impossible<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.660> usually

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
yards it's almost impossible to usually

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.880 
yards it's almost impossible to usually
make<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> through<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.469> without<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> lot<00:01:01.859> of

make it through there without a lot of
horsepower<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:03.090> sometimes<00:01:03.530> sometimes<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
horsepower like sometimes sometimes you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.690 
horsepower like sometimes sometimes you
just<00:01:04.710> end<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.010> getting<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.519> running

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
just end up getting off and running

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.560 
just end up getting off and running
through<00:01:05.880> Sam<00:01:06.090> cornering<00:01:07.049> through<00:01:07.290> sand<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
through Sam cornering through sand is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.899 
through Sam cornering through sand is
well<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.960> pretty<00:01:10.020> fun<00:01:10.580> San<00:01:11.580> loose

dirt you'll see what I'm talking about
the<00:01:25.290> front<00:01:25.530> wheel<00:01:25.680> ought<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> slide<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the front wheel ought to slide out as I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
the front wheel ought to slide out as I
as<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.020> move<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.320> foot<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.950> watch<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.430> come

so<00:01:50.110> yeah<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.409> know<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> sharper<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.070> corner

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
so yeah you know the sharper the corner

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.280 
so yeah you know the sharper the corner
is<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.880> more<00:01:52.330> likely<00:01:52.659> are<00:01:52.960> you're<00:01:53.110> going<00:01:53.200> to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
is the more likely are you're going to

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.860 
is the more likely are you're going to
be<00:01:53.380> slide<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.550> moved<00:01:55.120> my<00:01:55.210> foot<00:01:55.450> enough<00:01:55.690> that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
be slide I I moved my foot enough that

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.600 
be slide I I moved my foot enough that
it<00:01:55.960> really<00:01:56.200> pushed<00:01:56.860> my<00:01:57.040> wheels<00:01:57.250> into<00:01:57.490> the
