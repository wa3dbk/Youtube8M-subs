00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
recoil jump the designers really went

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890

the cool thing is a producer love about

the cool thing is a producer love about
unity<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.030> how<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.510> empowers<00:01:38.960> designers<00:01:39.530> if

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
unity is how it empowers designers if

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.340 
unity is how it empowers designers if

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
stop there the designer felt oh we could

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.000 
stop there the designer felt oh we could
get<00:04:00.400> more<00:04:00.640> mileage<00:04:00.880> out<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.210> this<00:04:01.420> puppy<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.260> he
