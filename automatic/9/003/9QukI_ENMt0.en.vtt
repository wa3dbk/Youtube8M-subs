00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I found these jars from home goods and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
I found these jars from home goods and
they<00:00:58.379> were<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.710> under<00:00:59.190> $3<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.000> piece<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
they were all under $3 a piece so if you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.299 
they were all under $3 a piece so if you
go<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> Dollar<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> could<00:01:02.190> probably

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
go to the Dollar so you could probably

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
go to the Dollar so you could probably
find<00:01:02.670> them<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.090> even<00:01:03.750> less<00:01:03.899> than<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.170> but

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
find them for even less than that but

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.740 
find them for even less than that but
the<00:01:05.129> most<00:01:05.280> important<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> make<00:01:06.600> sure

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
the most important thing is to make sure
that<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> jars<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.590> airtight<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that the jars are airtight because you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.679 
that the jars are airtight because you
want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:08.970> sure<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.299> none<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
so what I did is I kind of got an idea

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.910 
so what I did is I kind of got an idea
of<00:02:55.330> where<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.600> wanted<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.019> cups<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.440> go<00:02:56.560> before

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
of where I wanted the cups to go before

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.550 
of where I wanted the cups to go before
I<00:02:56.950> actually<00:02:57.239> put<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.390> adhesive<00:02:58.510> onto<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
I actually put the adhesive onto the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.290 
I actually put the adhesive onto the
cabinets<00:02:59.980> because<00:03:00.280> once<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.640> put<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:00.970> it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
cabinets because once you put it on it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.570 
cabinets because once you put it on it
is<00:03:01.480> kind<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.560> pain<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.980> butt<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.310> take<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
is kind of a pain in the butt to take it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.720 
is kind of a pain in the butt to take it
off<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.880> have<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.030> do<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.330> all<00:03:04.450> over<00:03:04.690> again

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
