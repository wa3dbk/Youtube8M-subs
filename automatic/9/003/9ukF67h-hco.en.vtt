 he told me he had spoken during the 11 days before the day's figure is 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.230
 like that still to assure eight flights and several places by the palings they 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.769
 live 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.089
 for accusing them of heavy but not me 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.720
 today it's like that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.630
 how should i say i have to tell you how are you going to please 50 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.109
 employees that's true 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.159
 we would call it then on stage a diamond 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.099
 his younger sister 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.910
 the object of his quest 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 this profession since 94 it's been two years of the mix 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.090
 nex from 15 to 100% 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.620
 everything that flows from it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.630
 trip hop of rock and electro metal 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.400
 dani sordo 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.520
 and comfort 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.450
 I arrived in this his 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.130
 I dream of police 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 % 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 three goals to hide 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 and after earlier to do 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.500
 I found myself in the hip-hop culture I wanted to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.190
 to move people 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.100
 I am not likely to put forward 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.380
 I enjoyed seeing people put ahead of the dancers 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.300
 all the people who just come who's doing in the evening 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.930
 it has to be a manager 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 my idea 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 21 story itself 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.720
 passionate about the hair 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.200
 by accumulating hair I could do a lot of parties a lot of plans 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.360
 radio plans 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 and the plans of tolerance 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.840
 account george 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.020
 3 after leaving the room 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.280
 then after one side the influences of people who have me 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.680
 influenced by hip-hop the disbursed cost of the man 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.010
 trackside in gc mix the shoes seemed so 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.040
 antalis term character 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.229
 even end up in a people who knows the man the classic ipod 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.079
 after I went to get the samples and and the musical origins 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.619
 I try to put myself in the shoes of the Americans 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.329
 when they are designed these rap albums from the 90's of what happened 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.789
 perhaps 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.899
 and so from there I put myself in the case in the sum of things 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:25.739
 enough 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.739
 this is where I want to share with people so that 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.549
 the lucky ones who stands behind your music does she have character 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 I am not very fan of banks know not end of bling-bling 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.009
 the club stream the music looks like me and that people can associate a 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.479
 certain style 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.479
 indigenous 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.479
 for the rest tense 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.409
 I can tell you is that sion 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.529
 respect for the mixed public 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.119
 at the mentality level 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.759
 for me this circuit 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.699
 after because so difficult but remade a nod to my Swedish friend mad max 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.099
 the former presbytery in mitchell suede 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.829
 almost perfect car 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.429
 cool presence 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.429
 and he's very eclectic 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.509
 swine 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.739
 no if we judge by his passion for he quotes the demand 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.509
 this program of the next evening 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.499
 he has a very jazzy side me I still thought a lot of influenced 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.319
 at least two years 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.589
 and on the life of the site 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.269
 just as you are not killing September 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.269
 with all these great spaces 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.199
 we leave 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.199
 so why wait 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.629
 in good rank 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.729
 3 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.549
 in fact I have a rather unusual course 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.939
 neck of bleine music when I started mixing 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.009
 a little bit of french rap 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.620
 a late match 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.009
 the song is french 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.009
 I'm more focused on lyrics about music 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.650
 and so 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.630
 always via my brother the shahid way so of an association or of 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.889
 my two tickets that was giving classes 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.729
 a small shot apparently his CEO Spyker 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.569
 phoenix is ​​from a cabin 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.979
 very good ear that took me not bad 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.129
 technique mix and stone arditi time it pity giraud 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.479
 I'm his way since the fall 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.729
 the techniques and the championships a dilemma if all that 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.069
 I continue to access it 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.509
 and for those people and 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.909
 through the techniques but six months later they made me 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.629
 anthony coudert music 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.629
 and offer the people of Madrid a good deal in order to increase 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.820
 that's why I started to the musicians I knew 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.009
 not 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.360
 most of their influences 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.949
 and that's what I like especially did not talk about the circuit at all
