really<00:00:37.260> getting<00:00:37.440> tired<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> we've<00:00:38.400> been

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really getting tired of this we've been

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
really getting tired of this we've been
wandering<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.030> days<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.630> and<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.380> all

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
wandering for days now and this is all

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
wandering for days now and this is all
we've<00:00:40.770> seen<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.490> was<00:00:42.360> hoping<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.810> apocalypse

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
we've seen I was hoping the apocalypse

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
we've seen I was hoping the apocalypse
would<00:00:43.590> bring<00:00:43.830> about<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> change<00:00:44.220> of<00:00:44.700> pace<00:00:44.880> but<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
would bring about a change of pace but I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
would bring about a change of pace but I
see<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.260> wrong<00:00:46.700> what<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> can't<00:00:48.059> figure<00:00:48.210> out

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
see I was wrong what I can't figure out

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
see I was wrong what I can't figure out
is<00:00:48.570> why<00:00:48.750> we're<00:00:48.960> still<00:00:49.170> alive<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.040> place<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
is why we're still alive this place is a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
is why we're still alive this place is a
wasteland<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.570> were<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> center<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
wasteland and we were in the center of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.440 
wasteland and we were in the center of
the<00:00:52.350> explosion<00:00:52.470> we<00:00:53.430> should<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.970> dead

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
the explosion we should be dead

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.140 
the explosion we should be dead
I<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:55.320> draw<00:00:55.500> no<00:00:55.830> definitive<00:00:56.250> conclusions

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
I can draw no definitive conclusions

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.240 
I can draw no definitive conclusions
without<00:00:57.360> additional<00:00:58.050> data<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.830> my<00:00:59.010> best

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
without additional data but my best

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.009 
without additional data but my best
guess<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.519> that<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> containment<00:01:00.390> field<00:01:00.629> we

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
guess is that the containment field we

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.350 
guess is that the containment field we
were<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.320> somehow<00:01:01.680> shielded<00:01:02.370> us<00:01:02.519> was<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
were in somehow shielded us was the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.380 
were in somehow shielded us was the
field<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.900> strong<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:05.000> find<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> hard<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
field that strong I find it hard to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.160 
field that strong I find it hard to
believe<00:01:06.560> yet<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.300> so<00:01:09.300> what<00:01:09.780> happened

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
believe yet here we are so what happened

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.880 
believe yet here we are so what happened
to<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.710> announcer<00:01:11.160> Pez<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.970> nice<00:01:12.590> my<00:01:13.590> best

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to the announcer Pez and nice my best

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.250 
to the announcer Pez and nice my best
guess<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.610> died<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.240> doubt<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
guess is they died I doubt that they

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.510 
guess is they died I doubt that they
could<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.500> survived<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.010> blast

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
could have survived the blast

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.710 
could have survived the blast
