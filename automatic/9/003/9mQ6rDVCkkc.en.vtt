maybe<00:05:07.710> longer<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.780> in<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.810> summer<00:05:10.289> I<00:05:10.530> would

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
maybe longer and in the summer I would

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.420 
maybe longer and in the summer I would
leave<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.099> out<00:05:11.220> overnight<00:05:11.840> covered<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.430> then

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
leave it out overnight covered and then

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.879 
leave it out overnight covered and then
put<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.060> into<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.510> refrigerator<00:05:15.680> into<00:05:16.680> a

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
put it into the refrigerator into a

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.379 
put it into the refrigerator into a
glass<00:05:17.190> jar<00:05:17.220> or<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:19.310> let<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.460> finish<00:05:20.910> for

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
glass jar or and let it finish for

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.469 
glass jar or and let it finish for
mething<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.470> cooler<00:05:23.340> situation<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.300> your

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
mething in cooler situation if your

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.620 
mething in cooler situation if your
weather<00:05:24.690> is<00:05:24.840> cool<00:05:25.139> then<00:05:26.039> leave<00:05:27.000> it<00:05:27.030> out<00:05:27.270> and

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
weather is cool then leave it out and

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.490 
weather is cool then leave it out and
it'll<00:05:27.990> go<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> little<00:05:28.380> bit<00:05:28.590> faster<00:05:29.210> now<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.570> want

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
it'll go a little bit faster now I want

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500 
it'll go a little bit faster now I want
to<00:05:31.620> show<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.630> kimchi<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.530> made<00:05:35.510> three

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
to show the kimchi that I made three

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.140 
to show the kimchi that I made three
days<00:05:36.720> ago

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
days ago

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.480 
days ago
it<00:05:39.150> looks<00:05:39.450> just<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:40.620> little<00:05:40.889> bit<00:05:41.039> different<00:05:41.460> now

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
it looks just a little bit different now

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.610 
it looks just a little bit different now
ah<00:05:42.530> but<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.620> rubber<00:05:43.800> gloves<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.340> can<00:05:44.520> do<00:05:44.639> this

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
ah but the rubber gloves I can do this

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.240 
ah but the rubber gloves I can do this
so<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.770> looks<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.099> little<00:05:47.220> bit<00:05:47.460> different<00:05:47.610> and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
so it looks a little bit different and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.890 
so it looks a little bit different and
there<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.460> go<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:51.000> can<00:05:51.030> see<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.479> things

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
there you go you can see that things

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.170 
there you go you can see that things
haven't<00:05:52.169> broken<00:05:52.680> down<00:05:52.860> quite<00:05:53.220> as<00:05:53.400> much<00:05:53.610> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
haven't broken down quite as much the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.390 
haven't broken down quite as much the
fermentation<00:05:54.539> process<00:05:54.900> has<00:05:55.590> occurred<00:05:56.070> with

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
fermentation process has occurred with

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.379 
fermentation process has occurred with
with<00:05:56.820> this<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:58.080> morning<00:05:58.849> my<00:05:59.849> son<00:06:00.150> made<00:06:00.360> a

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
with this this morning my son made a

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.730 
with this this morning my son made a
tortilla<00:06:00.960> with<00:06:01.789> eggs<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:04.199> little<00:06:04.620> bit

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
tortilla with eggs and a little bit

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.529 
tortilla with eggs and a little bit
cheese<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.310> put<00:06:05.460> this<00:06:05.610> into<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.000> tortilla

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
cheese and put this into the tortilla

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.760 
cheese and put this into the tortilla
and<00:06:06.750> liked<00:06:07.139> it<00:06:07.320> very<00:06:07.349> much

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
and liked it very much

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.000 
and liked it very much
just<00:06:08.160> experimenting<00:06:09.120> how<00:06:09.840> is<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.199> eaten<00:06:10.500> its

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
just experimenting how is it eaten its

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.370 
just experimenting how is it eaten its
eaten<00:06:11.310> alongside<00:06:11.610> rice<00:06:12.180> sometimes<00:06:12.990> it's

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
eaten alongside rice sometimes it's

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.090 
eaten alongside rice sometimes it's
eaten<00:06:13.620> three<00:06:13.890> meals<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.340> day

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
eaten three meals a day

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.510 
eaten three meals a day
rice<00:06:15.340> maybe<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.510> softly<00:06:17.290> cooked<00:06:17.560> egg<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:18.130> in

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
rice maybe a softly cooked egg in in

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.180 
rice maybe a softly cooked egg in in
there<00:06:18.850> and<00:06:19.120> a<00:06:19.450> side<00:06:19.870> of<00:06:20.310> this<00:06:21.310> kimchi<00:06:23.190> noodle

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
there and a side of this kimchi noodle

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.920 
there and a side of this kimchi noodle
dishes<00:06:24.400> contain<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:26.850> stir-fried<00:06:27.850> rice<00:06:27.930> there

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
dishes contain it stir-fried rice there

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.720 
dishes contain it stir-fried rice there
are<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.050> lot<00:06:29.260> of<00:06:29.290> recipes<00:06:29.560> out<00:06:29.950> there<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.430> some

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
are a lot of recipes out there and some

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.420 
are a lot of recipes out there and some
of<00:06:30.910> those<00:06:31.090> almost<00:06:31.840> demand<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:32.830> you<00:06:32.950> cook<00:06:33.250> it

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
of those almost demand that you cook it

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.090 
of those almost demand that you cook it
but<00:06:33.610> if<00:06:33.760> you<00:06:33.880> cook<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.300> you're<00:06:35.200> going<00:06:35.560> to<00:06:35.770> cook

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
but if you cook it you're going to cook

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.920 
but if you cook it you're going to cook
the<00:06:36.480> probiotics<00:06:37.480> so<00:06:37.900> my<00:06:38.500> preference<00:06:39.310> is<00:06:39.610> to

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
the probiotics so my preference is to

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.140 
the probiotics so my preference is to
take<00:06:40.930> that<00:06:41.200> hot<00:06:41.500> rice<00:06:41.830> put<00:06:42.310> it<00:06:42.430> into<00:06:42.790> a<00:06:42.820> dish

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
take that hot rice put it into a dish

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.430 
take that hot rice put it into a dish
and<00:06:43.920> add<00:06:44.920> the<00:06:45.370> egg<00:06:45.550> and<00:06:46.030> then<00:06:46.750> put<00:06:47.110> this<00:06:47.260> around

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
and add the egg and then put this around

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.230 
and add the egg and then put this around
the<00:06:47.800> edge<00:06:47.920> where<00:06:48.460> it's<00:06:48.580> not<00:06:48.760> going<00:06:49.030> to<00:06:49.210> just

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
the edge where it's not going to just

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.470 
the edge where it's not going to just
cook<00:06:49.690> everything<00:06:50.230> away<00:06:50.350> and<00:06:51.300> that'll<00:06:52.300> take

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
cook everything away and that'll take

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.660 
cook everything away and that'll take
care<00:06:52.510> of<00:06:52.750> it<00:06:52.990> I<00:06:55.140> strongly<00:06:56.140> urge<00:06:56.590> you<00:06:57.100> to<00:06:57.460> try

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
care of it I strongly urge you to try

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.650 
care of it I strongly urge you to try
this<00:06:58.630> very<00:06:58.690> good<00:07:00.120> very<00:07:01.170> different<00:07:02.170> food<00:07:02.860> and

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
this very good very different food and

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.150 
this very good very different food and
experiment<00:07:04.660> a<00:07:04.720> little<00:07:05.020> why<00:07:05.110> thing<00:07:05.320> I<00:07:05.440> didn't

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
experiment a little why thing I didn't

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.060 
experiment a little why thing I didn't
leave<00:07:06.340> out<00:07:06.520> is<00:07:06.880> a<00:07:07.420> teaspoon<00:07:08.140> of<00:07:08.380> sugar<00:07:08.440> and

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
leave out is a teaspoon of sugar and

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.120 
leave out is a teaspoon of sugar and
this<00:07:09.670> boosts<00:07:10.120> the<00:07:10.270> fermentation<00:07:10.690> and<00:07:11.320> it's<00:07:12.010> a

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
this boosts the fermentation and it's a

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.850 
this boosts the fermentation and it's a
good<00:07:12.310> thing<00:07:12.520> to<00:07:12.700> add<00:07:12.880> in<00:07:13.180> and<00:07:13.510> then<00:07:13.810> a<00:07:14.050> couple

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
good thing to add in and then a couple

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.910 
good thing to add in and then a couple
oh<00:07:15.600> maybe<00:07:16.600> half<00:07:16.960> a<00:07:17.080> cup<00:07:17.320> of<00:07:17.530> water<00:07:18.010> in<00:07:18.460> here

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 
oh maybe half a cup of water in here

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.690 
oh maybe half a cup of water in here
will<00:07:20.920> also<00:07:21.340> be<00:07:21.610> a<00:07:21.640> little<00:07:21.970> boost<00:07:23.400> now<00:07:26.700> you're

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
will also be a little boost now you're

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.910 
will also be a little boost now you're
leaving<00:07:27.850> this<00:07:28.180> out<00:07:28.510> for<00:07:29.050> a<00:07:29.080> few<00:07:29.230> days

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:29.920 
leaving this out for a few days

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.690 
leaving this out for a few days
maybe<00:07:30.670> overnight<00:07:31.510> maybe<00:07:32.110> one<00:07:32.740> to<00:07:33.040> three<00:07:33.070> days

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.700 
maybe overnight maybe one to three days

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.740 
maybe overnight maybe one to three days
but<00:07:34.630> your<00:07:35.110> storage<00:07:35.710> should<00:07:36.340> be<00:07:36.750> refrigeration

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
but your storage should be refrigeration

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.530 
but your storage should be refrigeration
once<00:07:38.500> you<00:07:38.830> start<00:07:39.250> seeing<00:07:39.610> signs<00:07:40.300> of

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:40.540 
once you start seeing signs of

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.780 
once you start seeing signs of
fermentation<00:07:41.440> which<00:07:42.040> will<00:07:42.190> be<00:07:42.310> some<00:07:42.490> little

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.790 
fermentation which will be some little
