00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 TV 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.599
 My name is Felipe Assis and in that class 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 People are going to talk a little more 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 aimed at beginners 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 I wanted to talk about models of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 We'll start with this guitar. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.519
 model here is history is one of the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:32.390
 first guitars ever made is the model 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:36.860
 Stratocaster on guitar is the main 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 components of the lesson are the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 these three single computers and the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.820
 Point out the fear that exists in it. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 ok this is a guitar that has 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.280
 characteristics of a more open sound 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.680
 a higher pitch sound is up to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 cause of these pickups single is she has 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.189
 a volume a huge volume button 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 volume where tom and another from Tony here 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.950
 below and her main one is the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.110
 use of this triangle that I was 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 speaking in the case I use tremor 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 there are lots of people who use 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 this triangle here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.900
 leaning against the wood as if it were a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 guitar is fixed a fixed bridge in my 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.020
 if I use with it floating 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.250
 I can make five combinations with 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 these scavengers is in the arm computer 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.799
 people in this position the sensor of the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.189
 arm 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.750
 in this second position would be the 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.759
 pickers the pickup arm and means 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.399
 in this third position would be the sensor 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.799
 the middle one 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.440
 this in the fourth position would already be the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.170
 pickup means and the bridge and in the end 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.730
 bridge pickup 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.160
 demonstrate a little bit 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.890
 that this guitar has the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.400
 Her ringtones are okay. 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.599
 there will start here by computer 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.599
 arm band 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.340
 I'm not more full-bodied and a little more 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.220
 serious 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.860
 in this second position here that we have 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.950
 the arm and middle pickup people already 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.430
 will have a little more install of 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.430
 move a little bit 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.209
 i 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.470
 good now the middle pickup 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:55.830
 is now the gauge of the environment and 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.830
 bridge 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.310
 and now the pickup of the bridge 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:46.000
 I also wanted to talk about what is the most 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:48.020
 usual using this guitar the normal 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.110
 especially for those who are using 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.180
 Distortion an overdrive with 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:59.470
 using the bridge pickup would be 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.470
 more or less this here 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.180
 already these two collectors here being 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.050
 used in position 2 would be another sound 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.650
 for the country has a style more than 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.590
 field who is a team a little more 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.590
 estaladÃ£o as you will see water 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.740
 also installed but a bit more 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.690
 serious is the position in this second position 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.300
 here from top to bottom it would be the 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.300
 arm and middle pickup 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.949
 i 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:38.910
 this type is very characteristic 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.919
 has distinguished in vogue in and now a 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.400
 bit with the pickup distortion of the 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.400
 arm 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.739
 this one was the extract model and in the 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:05.319
 next video vote showing model 

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:05.319
 little English here on the side is the image
