00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
karate kid was double dragon because the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.820 
karate kid was double dragon because the
karate<00:02:12.390> kid<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> good<00:02:13.290> game<00:02:13.500> by<00:02:13.709> any

with you I'm sure it was bad but I can't

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.680 
with you I'm sure it was bad but I can't
remember<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.850> because<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.270> was<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.480> long<00:02:42.630> ago

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
when I watched it I think I was pretty

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.990 
when I watched it I think I was pretty
disappointed<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:47.520> movie<00:02:47.790> came

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
disappointed with it but the movie came

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.020 
disappointed with it but the movie came
out<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.620> pretty<00:02:49.620> much<00:02:49.650> sucked<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> US<00:02:50.730> i'm

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.320 
sure most other regions and neo geo the
company<00:02:56.100> Technos<00:02:56.490> decided<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.180> they

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
company Technos decided you know they

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.650 
company Technos decided you know they
had<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.900> license<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.570> Double<00:03:00.570> Dragon

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
had the license to the Double Dragon

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.540 
had the license to the Double Dragon
games<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.620> decided<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.280> they<00:03:02.430> were

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
games and they decided that they were

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.430 
games and they decided that they were
going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.940> make<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> fighting<00:03:03.570> game<00:03:03.600> based<00:03:04.170> off

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
going to make a fighting game based off

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.580 
going to make a fighting game based off
the<00:03:04.620> double<00:03:04.890> dragon<00:03:05.220> movie<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.900> think<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the double dragon movie and I think the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.260 
the double dragon movie and I think the
last<00:03:07.800> fighting<00:03:08.280> game<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.610> came<00:03:08.790> out<00:03:08.970> prior

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
last fighting game that came out prior

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.450 
last fighting game that came out prior

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
unfortunately the company that made it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.170 
unfortunately the company that made it
lost<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.080> rights<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:45.620> double<00:05:45.980> dragon<00:05:46.430> so<00:05:46.970> they

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
lost the rights to double dragon so they

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.850 
lost the rights to double dragon so they
created<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.690> sequel<00:05:48.050> called<00:05:48.230> rage<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.800> the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
dragons that kind of had the same

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.480 
dragons that kind of had the same
character<00:05:51.260> basis<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.860> everything<00:05:52.160> they<00:05:52.280> just

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
character basis and everything they just

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.440 
character basis and everything they just
change<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:52.790> names<00:05:53.000> and<00:05:53.120> stuff<00:05:53.240> like<00:05:53.390> that

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
change the names and stuff like that

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.240 
change the names and stuff like that
it's<00:05:54.110> another<00:05:54.290> good<00:05:54.560> game<00:05:54.770> but<00:05:55.010> it<00:05:55.070> has<00:05:55.220> a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
it's another good game but it has a

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.210 
it's another good game but it has a
weird<00:05:55.520> combo<00:05:55.970> system<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:56.960> all<00:05:57.080> in<00:05:57.230> all<00:05:57.350> if<00:05:58.010> we

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
weird combo system but all in all if we

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.280 
weird combo system but all in all if we
have<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.430> go<00:05:58.550> back<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.940> Double<00:05:59.480> Dragon<00:05:59.600> here<00:06:00.110> I

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
have to go back to Double Dragon here I

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.780 
have to go back to Double Dragon here I
probably<00:06:01.190> give<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.990> 4<00:06:02.990> out<00:06:03.020> 5<00:06:03.400> i'm<00:06:04.400> not<00:06:04.640> going

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
probably give it a 4 out 5 i'm not going

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.130 
probably give it a 4 out 5 i'm not going
to<00:06:04.850> give<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.270> complete<00:06:05.600> rating<00:06:05.990> because

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
to give it a complete rating because

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.380 
to give it a complete rating because
again<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:07.010> music<00:06:07.460> in<00:06:07.610> certain<00:06:07.910> areas<00:06:08.030> is

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
again the music in certain areas is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.560 
again the music in certain areas is
passable<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.290> not<00:06:09.860> really<00:06:10.010> faithful<00:06:10.340> to<00:06:10.970> the

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
passable and not really faithful to the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.840 
passable and not really faithful to the
original<00:06:11.600> double<00:06:12.320> dragon<00:06:12.680> sound<00:06:12.950> but<00:06:13.640> for

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
original double dragon sound but for

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.610

being a game based off of movie that
probably<00:06:16.040> sucked<00:06:16.430> as<00:06:16.610> bad<00:06:16.640> as<00:06:17.000> i<00:06:17.120> think<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.480> did

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770
