00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.950
 hi to all ten of spacesgames I am 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 doctor white are serious with a new one 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 fast video on fifa 14 next gen 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 finally I could try it for 2 3 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.170
 days and these are my first 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750
 impressions after about twenty of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 games played first impression you see 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.150
 already in the video below is the bug that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
 we had shown the goal bar 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 easy to cancer mandate that much but 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.300
 many people exploit this bug also of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 more than on with 360 and ps3 so only 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.570
 design and holds this bug and even more 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 exploited compared to before 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.920
 my advice to counter that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.350
 vague and take your player e 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.149
 back off when you see the other one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.590
 opponent will set off the attackers 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 this way you should succeed in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.079
 counter it with other things I have 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.690
 noticed the throws that seem to me 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 better than the versions or gen 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 you can see a great shot of here 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.449
 Guarin in general from afar is more 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 easy to score the goalkeeper too 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 they seem slightly worse 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.260
 sometimes they make incredible ducks 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 like this which is a thing 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 unwatchable because the goalkeeper instead 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 which sweep as it usually does in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.270
 automatic stops practically gives 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 an easy goal to the opponents throws 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.100
 even around I suggest you try it a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.830
 around because it's easy to score 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.049
 certainly not how it certainly is not 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.329
 situation we had at the exit of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.000
 game for 360 and ps3 where practically 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.100
 all the trucks were on target 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 but I have noticed that in this one 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.079
 edition of xbox one and that s4 shooting a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.700
 lap are slightly enhanced then 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.070
 if you have a very good player 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.130
 technically how can it be falcao io 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.240
 I tried also with schurrle you will succeed 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 safely to engage the goalkeeper 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.649
 you take traverses you can score 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 very easily so if you are in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.380
 difficulty perhaps in opposing team e 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 closed in defense 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.390
 try something else around 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 which seems to me worse and the question 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 defense not rotated by playing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.329
 predominantly in division 1 which is 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.369
 very easy to mark this not me 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.840
 I was expecting it I thought it was like a bit up 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.099
 360 and ps3 where a good guy is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.260
 to defend oneself is really difficult 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.890
 pass this have not noticed in 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.230
 this game I notice a predominance of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.910
 other filtering and low filtering of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 general as you can see just one 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.500
 well put filtering also with a 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.060
 player not fearfully technical as 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.980
 can be guarin that surely has a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 excellent value of passages but is not pirlo 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.569
 to send to your door a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.430
 striker so try so much with 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.299
 filtering devices to break up the defenses 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.610
 opponents 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.590
 even long throws are very effective 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.780
 and delegating launches from the rear lines yes 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.220
 often turn into scoring opportunities 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 this is because even the central defenders 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.980
 they are not perfect in marking sometimes 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.290
 they fail 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.940
 we can see the game rollovers 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.459
 they are very fast and very effective 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.959
 this is a perfect counter-attack 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.090
 concluded by guarin 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.980
 last thing the head shots that are yes 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.349
 effective but I only noticed those 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.239
 high enough players therefore not 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.819
 I still managed to score with people 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.110
 as de bruyne which is not for sure 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.319
 very high young like I might have been 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.150
 made immediately to 13 for xbox 360 with today 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.410
 we concluded I would like to leave you 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.450
 a lay comment with channel subscribers 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.600
 of themes in the comments what you noticed 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.400
 in the passage between 360 xbox a year between 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.690
 ps3 and ps 4 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 we will meet again soon with the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.880
 falcao review hello everyone 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 all right 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.070
