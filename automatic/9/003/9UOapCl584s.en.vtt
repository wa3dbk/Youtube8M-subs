hi<00:00:03.060> welcome<00:00:03.419> back

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi welcome back

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.340 
hi welcome back
here's<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.980> small<00:00:05.549> tip<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.210> creating<00:00:06.660> tension

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
here's a small tip for creating tension

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.770 
here's a small tip for creating tension
and<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:07.980> sophisticated<00:00:08.340> modern<00:00:08.970> sound<00:00:09.420> in

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
and a more sophisticated modern sound in

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.379 
and a more sophisticated modern sound in
your<00:00:09.960> playing<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.400> idea<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.849> play<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
your playing and the idea is to play the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.550 
your playing and the idea is to play the
fourth<00:00:13.139> degree<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.580> scale<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:16.020> fifth

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
fourth degree of the scale on a fifth

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.380 
fourth degree of the scale on a fifth
degree<00:00:16.830> bass<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.500> let's<00:00:19.500> take<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> look<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
degree bass so let's take a look at the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.509 
degree bass so let's take a look at the
at<00:00:21.390> C<00:00:21.720> major<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.340> degree

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
at C major the this is the first degree

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
at C major the this is the first degree
the<00:00:26.699> rule<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.449> fourth<00:00:27.779> degree<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.260> F<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the rule the fourth degree in F and the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
the rule the fourth degree in F and the
fifth<00:00:29.519> degree<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.090> G<00:00:30.480> suppose<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.619> had<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> play

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
fifth degree a G suppose you had to play

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.240 
fifth degree a G suppose you had to play
a<00:00:32.099> progression<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.880> went<00:00:33.860> fourth<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
a progression which went fourth the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:47.180 
a progression which went fourth the
fifth<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.120> first<00:00:36.420> f<00:00:37.320> -<00:00:37.860> C<00:00:38.070> -<00:00:38.100> G<00:00:38.309> -<00:00:38.760> C

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.240 

instead<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.820> could<00:00:48.940> play<00:00:52.620> f2f<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.039> base

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
instead you could play f2f on the base

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.290 
instead you could play f2f on the base
of<00:00:54.280> G<00:00:54.879> which<00:00:55.359> is<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.570> force<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.820> base<00:00:57.820> which<00:00:58.120> is

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
of G which is a force on a base which is

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.090 
of G which is a force on a base which is
a<00:00:58.329> fifth<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.089> first<00:01:01.619> so<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:02.649> only<00:01:02.860> thing

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
a fifth and the first so the only thing

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.600 
a fifth and the first so the only thing
you've<00:01:03.250> changed<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:04.030> instead<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.420> playing<00:01:04.750> G

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you've changed is instead of playing G

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810 
you've changed is instead of playing G
the<00:01:06.610> fifth<00:01:06.850> degree<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.350> base<00:01:08.649> which<00:01:09.460> fits

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the fifth degree on a base which fits

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.609 
the fifth degree on a base which fits
the<00:01:10.060> fifth<00:01:10.270> degree<00:01:10.420> which<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.869> GS<00:01:11.259> as<00:01:11.409> well

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
the fifth degree which is a GS as well

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.740 
the fifth degree which is a GS as well
you're<00:01:12.580> now<00:01:12.789> playing<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:14.130> force<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.490> F<00:01:16.420> in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
you're now playing the force and F in

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.630 
you're now playing the force and F in
your<00:01:16.810> right<00:01:17.080> hand<00:01:17.380> but<00:01:17.740> you're<00:01:17.950> keeping<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
your right hand but you're keeping the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.540 
your right hand but you're keeping the
same<00:01:18.909> base<00:01:19.240> 253<00:01:20.200> base<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.619> G<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.100> your<00:01:21.159> left

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
same base 253 base the G in your left

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.260 
same base 253 base the G in your left
hand

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.340 

so<00:01:26.270> instead<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:27.640> your<00:01:28.640> doing<00:01:31.869> once<00:01:32.869> again<00:01:32.990> this

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
so instead of your doing once again this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.390 
so instead of your doing once again this
is<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.530> way<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.710> creating<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.220> more

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
is the way of creating a more

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.330 
is the way of creating a more
sophisticated<00:01:34.820> modern<00:01:35.479> sound<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.220> can

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
sophisticated modern sound and you can

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.560 
sophisticated modern sound and you can
use<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.700> many<00:01:37.850> many<00:01:38.090> different<00:01:38.180> situations

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
use it in many many different situations

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.820 
use it in many many different situations
or<00:01:40.150> taking<00:01:41.150> instead<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.570> playing<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> film<00:01:42.290> on

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
or taking instead of playing the film on

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.700 
or taking instead of playing the film on
fifth<00:01:43.520> base<00:01:44.470> substituting<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.590> fourth<00:01:47.710> so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
fifth base substituting the fourth so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.350 
fifth base substituting the fourth so
here's<00:01:48.860> another<00:01:49.070> example<00:01:49.280> really<00:01:49.909> are<00:01:50.030> just

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
here's another example really are just

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.180 
here's another example really are just
using<00:01:50.630> different<00:01:51.080> inversions<00:01:51.350> they<00:01:52.009> give

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
using different inversions they give

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.529 
using different inversions they give
slightly<00:01:52.490> different<00:01:52.909> sounds<00:01:53.300> here's<00:01:53.990> an<00:01:54.140> F

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
slightly different sounds here's an F

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.539 
slightly different sounds here's an F
here's<00:01:56.539> an<00:01:56.720> ever<00:01:56.929> basic<00:01:57.740> gene

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.940 

again

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.730 

tisn't<00:02:07.950> come<00:02:08.099> instead<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:20.020 

you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.550 

so<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.420> another<00:02:21.569> way<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.900> spicing<00:02:22.260> up

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
so it's just another way of spicing up

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.050 
so it's just another way of spicing up
your<00:02:22.620> playing<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.490> your<00:02:24.209> harmony<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:25.260> play

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
your playing and your harmony don't play

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.440 
your playing and your harmony don't play
15th<00:02:27.060> degree<00:02:27.950> they<00:02:28.950> force<00:02:29.340> forth<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
15th degree they force forth on the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.830 
15th degree they force forth on the
fifth<00:02:30.630> degree<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:32.819> as<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> final<00:02:33.330> concluding

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
fifth degree just as a final concluding

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.340 
fifth degree just as a final concluding
example<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.100> different<00:02:35.459> scale

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
example and it in a different scale

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.890 
example and it in a different scale
let's<00:02:37.350> take<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.459> F<00:02:38.610> major<00:02:38.880> scale

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.520 

here<00:02:43.709> your<00:02:43.920> fourth<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> beef<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.659> you're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
here your fourth is a beef that you're

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.569 
here your fourth is a beef that you're
50<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.360> your<00:02:48.900> first<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.739> root<00:02:49.920> is

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
50 you see and your first your root is

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.880 
50 you see and your first your root is
an<00:02:50.730> F<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.709> case<00:02:53.010> instead<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.489> playing

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
an F so in this case instead of playing

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:05.710 
an F so in this case instead of playing
force<00:02:56.269> v<00:03:00.290> play

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.309 

-<00:03:06.230> for<00:03:06.590> some<00:03:06.830> base<00:03:07.460> myth

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:30.960 

that<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:11.950> peaceful<00:03:13.230> please<00:03:14.230> Stefan<00:03:14.590> basically

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.470 

you<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.180> modulate<00:03:32.750> other

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.040 

you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:49.230 

you<00:03:41.050> see<00:03:46.860> that's<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.280> hope<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.850> found<00:03:49.060> this
