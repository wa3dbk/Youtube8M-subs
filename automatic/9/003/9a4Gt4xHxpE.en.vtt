00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
all right so let's uh run a car ramp a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.530 
all right so let's uh run a car ramp a
sub<00:00:07.580> off<00:00:08.580> your<00:00:09.059> computer<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.389> main

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
sub off your computer so the main

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
sub off your computer so the main
problem<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:13.049> bringing<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
problem with bringing that into the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.900 
problem with bringing that into the
house<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.980> that<00:00:16.980> runs<00:00:17.550> off<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.760> 12<00:00:18.270> volt<00:00:18.539> DC

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
house is that runs off the 12 volt DC

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.140 
house is that runs off the 12 volt DC
obviously<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> can't<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.449> plug<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> into<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
obviously you can't just plug it into a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.640 
obviously you can't just plug it into a
wall<00:00:24.150> outlet<00:00:24.350> that's<00:00:25.350> 120<00:00:26.160> volt<00:00:26.340> AC<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.500> did

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
wall outlet that's 120 volt AC so I did

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.290 
wall outlet that's 120 volt AC so I did
a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.859> looking<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> internet<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a little looking up on the internet and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
a little looking up on the internet and
you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.320> happens<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.070> out

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you know what just so happens to put out

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.209 
you know what just so happens to put out
12<00:00:32.640> volt<00:00:32.880> DC<00:00:34.190> your<00:00:35.190> computer<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.920> happen<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
12 volt DC your computer so we happen to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.560 
12 volt DC your computer so we happen to
have<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.430> old<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> basement<00:00:40.100> in<00:00:41.570> 1998

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
have an old one in the basement in 1998

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.840 
have an old one in the basement in 1998
I<00:00:42.600> believe<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:45.500> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.860> power<00:00:47.100> box<00:00:47.489> out

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I believe and this is the power box out

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
I believe and this is the power box out
of<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:50.690> nothing<00:00:51.690> too<00:00:52.020> complex<00:00:53.570> out<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.230> end

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of it nothing too complex out this end

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.599 
of it nothing too complex out this end
is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.219> cord<00:00:57.210> plugs<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> wall

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
is the cord plugs right into the wall

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.380 
is the cord plugs right into the wall
and<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.000> end<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:02.059> turning<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and out this end is the turning on and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.370 
and out this end is the turning on and
off<00:01:03.979> adult<00:01:04.979> analog<00:01:05.489> switch<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
off adult analog switch there and then a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.420 
off adult analog switch there and then a
bunch<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> wires<00:01:07.909> that's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> power

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bunch of wires that's a bit to the power

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060 
bunch of wires that's a bit to the power
box<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.229> every<00:01:13.560> computer

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
box is on pretty much every computer

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.590 
box is on pretty much every computer
located<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> top<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.530> computer

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
located in the top back of the computer

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.690 
located in the top back of the computer
that's<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.960> top<00:01:19.680> vent<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that's what this top vent here is in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
that's what this top vent here is in
general<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> heat<00:01:21.720> blowing<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
general with the heat blowing out of it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
general with the heat blowing out of it
over<00:01:22.710> time<00:01:23.780> that's

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
over time that's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.630 
over time that's
that<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:27.320> alesis<00:01:27.859> would<00:01:28.009> be<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> back<00:01:28.460> of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
that this alesis would be the back of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.099 
that this alesis would be the back of
the<00:01:28.729> computer<00:01:28.880> sticking<00:01:29.689> out<00:01:29.810> there<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:32.109> okay

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
the computer sticking out there and okay

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.990 
the computer sticking out there and okay
so<00:01:33.320> what<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.740> pull<00:01:33.950> out<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.369> once<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:34.850> get

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
so what you pull out of it once you get

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.219 
so what you pull out of it once you get
it<00:01:35.090> apart<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:36.880> let's<00:01:37.880> go<00:01:38.000> let's<00:01:38.750> go<00:01:38.899> power

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
it apart is this let's go let's go power

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.039 
it apart is this let's go let's go power
line<00:01:39.590> it's<00:01:40.039> got<00:01:40.310> an<00:01:40.729> on-off<00:01:40.909> switch<00:01:41.149> at<00:01:41.840> least

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
line it's got an on-off switch at least

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.380 
line it's got an on-off switch at least
an<00:01:42.229> older<00:01:42.319> one<00:01:42.649> like<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.069> does<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.179> then<00:01:44.360> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
an older one like this does and then a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.249 
an older one like this does and then a
big<00:01:44.569> old<00:01:44.750> tangled<00:01:45.259> wires<00:01:45.409> coming<00:01:45.829> up<00:01:46.959> so<00:01:47.959> the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
big old tangled wires coming up so the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.990 
big old tangled wires coming up so the
idea<00:01:48.560> here<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.950> power<00:01:49.189> or<00:01:50.259> Licht<00:01:51.259> power<00:01:52.000> an

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
idea here is the power or Licht power an

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.449 
idea here is the power or Licht power an
amp<00:01:53.469> so<00:01:54.469> I<00:01:54.530> did<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.709> little<00:01:54.920> looking<00:01:55.069> on<00:01:55.310> the

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
amp so I did a little looking on the

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.969 
amp so I did a little looking on the
internet<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.329> turns<00:01:56.569> out<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.140> as<00:01:57.739> far<00:01:57.950> as

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
internet and it turns out that as far as

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.559 
internet and it turns out that as far as
I<00:01:58.159> know<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:58.670> universal

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
I know this is universal

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.859 
I know this is universal
the<00:02:00.380> yellow<00:02:00.649> wires<00:02:01.659> are<00:02:02.659> 12<00:02:02.989> volt<00:02:03.319> positive<00:02:04.009> DC

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
the yellow wires are 12 volt positive DC

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.259 
the yellow wires are 12 volt positive DC
the<00:02:05.869> black<00:02:06.110> wires<00:02:07.030> negative<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.120> did

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
the black wires negative so what I did

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.740 
the black wires negative so what I did
is<00:02:11.599> just<00:02:11.630> took<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:13.489> know<00:02:13.610> three<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.030> em<00:02:14.390> by<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
is just took you know three of em by the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.059 
is just took you know three of em by the
way<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.530> clipped<00:02:16.040> these<00:02:16.250> wires<00:02:16.549> off<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:18.069> these

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
way I I clipped these wires off of these

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.720 
way I I clipped these wires off of these
style<00:02:19.579> connectors<00:02:20.829> for<00:02:21.829> all<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:24.200> then<00:02:24.980> as

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
style connectors for all because then as

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
style connectors for all because then as
you<00:02:25.849> can<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.180> here<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.750> clipped<00:02:30.049> yellow

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you can see here it's a clipped yellow

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.160 
you can see here it's a clipped yellow
wire<00:02:30.889> clip<00:02:31.370> black<00:02:31.639> wire<00:02:32.000> there<00:02:32.299> maybe<00:02:33.049> you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
wire clip black wire there maybe you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.690 
wire clip black wire there maybe you
can't<00:02:33.380> see<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.650> don't<00:02:33.859> know<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.069> camera<00:02:34.280> sucks

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
can't see I don't know this camera sucks

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.870 
can't see I don't know this camera sucks
but<00:02:35.200> yet<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.340> power<00:02:37.609> box

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
but yet on this on this power box

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.770 
but yet on this on this power box
specifically<00:02:38.630> there<00:02:38.959> were<00:02:39.260> three<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.280> them

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
specifically there were three of them

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.280 
specifically there were three of them
yeah<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.319> them<00:02:43.209> there<00:02:44.209> are<00:02:44.420> also<00:02:44.690> other

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
yeah three of them there are also other

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.890 
yeah three of them there are also other
clips<00:02:45.650> coming<00:02:45.980> off<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.400> these<00:02:47.000> style<00:02:47.510> clips

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
clips coming off of it these style clips

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.140 
clips coming off of it these style clips
these<00:02:48.109> go<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.530> motherboard<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.549> believe<00:02:49.850> I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
these go to the motherboard I believe I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.410 
these go to the motherboard I believe I
just<00:02:50.750> didn't<00:02:51.200> use<00:02:51.290> any<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.590> those<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.430> kind<00:02:53.359> of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
just didn't use any of those so kind of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.849 
just didn't use any of those so kind of
ignore<00:02:53.750> those<00:02:54.069> but<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.579> used<00:02:56.329> all<00:02:57.139> three<00:02:57.620> wires

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
ignore those but I used all three wires

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.640 
ignore those but I used all three wires
just<00:02:58.220> purely<00:02:58.489> for<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.849> reason<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.560> know

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
just purely for the reason that you know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250 
just purely for the reason that you know
I<00:03:00.680> figure<00:03:01.180> these<00:03:02.180> kind<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.599> draw<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> lot<00:03:03.109> of

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
I figure these kind of draw a lot of

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.400 
I figure these kind of draw a lot of
amps<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.859> you<00:03:04.609> know<00:03:04.730> use<00:03:05.060> three<00:03:05.630> wires<00:03:05.900> kind<00:03:06.349> of

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
amps so you know use three wires kind of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.479 
amps so you know use three wires kind of
like<00:03:06.530> having<00:03:06.709> one<00:03:06.950> bigger<00:03:07.160> wire<00:03:09.099> twice<00:03:10.099> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
like having one bigger wire twice the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.039 
like having one bigger wire twice the
three<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:12.049> three<00:03:12.459> positive<00:03:13.459> negative

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
three and the three positive negative

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.069 
three and the three positive negative
into<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.799> an<00:03:15.919> old<00:03:16.069> piece<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:18.019> know

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
into a just an old piece of you know

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.599 
into a just an old piece of you know
indoor<00:03:18.590> power<00:03:18.829> cord

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
indoor power cord

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.970 
indoor power cord
pretty<00:03:19.849> standard<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.510> hope<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.989> time<00:03:21.530> step<00:03:21.829> it

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
pretty standard I hope this time step it

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.440 
pretty standard I hope this time step it
up<00:03:22.099> you<00:03:22.700> know<00:03:22.819> some<00:03:23.060> old<00:03:23.150> lamp<00:03:23.480> or<00:03:23.750> something

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
up you know some old lamp or something

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.300 
up you know some old lamp or something
that<00:03:26.450> runs<00:03:26.630> right<00:03:26.959> down<00:03:26.989> to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.899 

got<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:32.409> positive<00:03:33.409> here<00:03:33.590> goes<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
got it to the positive here goes to the

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.910 
got it to the positive here goes to the
positive<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.689> then<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:37.299> already<00:03:38.299> thought

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
positive and then the I already thought

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.649 
positive and then the I already thought
that<00:03:39.920> goes<00:03:40.129> in<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.609> car<00:03:40.849> at<00:03:41.000> least<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.299> goes<00:03:41.420> to

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
that goes in a car at least it goes to

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.440 
that goes in a car at least it goes to
the<00:03:42.129> key<00:03:43.129> on<00:03:43.340> switch<00:03:43.909> or<00:03:44.540> key<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:45.049> wire<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.420> that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the key on switch or key on wire so that

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.449 
the key on switch or key on wire so that
would<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.019> know<00:03:48.109> let<00:03:48.379> it<00:03:48.409> know<00:03:48.680> when<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.280> turn

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
would you know let it know when to turn

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.420 
would you know let it know when to turn
on<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:50.030> what<00:03:50.329> not<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:51.019> run<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.340> know

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
on and what not I just run it you know

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.039 
on and what not I just run it you know
to<00:03:52.849> both<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.239> them<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.750> don't<00:03:53.900> know<00:03:53.989> if

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
to both of them is it I don't know if

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.849 
to both of them is it I don't know if
you<00:03:54.139> can<00:03:54.260> really<00:03:54.409> tell<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.400> just<00:03:55.549> ran<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.510> over

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
you can really tell I just ran it over

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.160 
you can really tell I just ran it over
to<00:03:57.859> both<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.250> them<00:03:58.370> screwed<00:03:59.329> it<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.599> there<00:03:59.810> ran

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
to both of them screwed it in there ran

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.110 
to both of them screwed it in there ran
it<00:04:00.290> over<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.650> top<00:04:00.859> screwed<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.549> there<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
it over the top screwed it in there and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.800 
it over the top screwed it in there and
then<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.500> negative<00:04:04.720> because<00:04:05.720> I

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
then this is just the negative because I

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
then this is just the negative because I
mean<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.290> don't<00:04:06.379> really<00:04:06.560> need<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.859> key<00:04:07.159> on<00:04:07.370> here

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
mean you don't really need a key on here

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.089 
mean you don't really need a key on here
obviously<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.359> just<00:04:08.450> just<00:04:09.319> gone<00:04:09.590> off<00:04:09.769> switch

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
obviously it's just just gone off switch

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.740 
obviously it's just just gone off switch
here<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.579> it's<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:12.459> or<00:04:13.459> off<00:04:13.939> and<00:04:14.239> as<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.629> can

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
here so it's on or off and as you can

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.569 
here so it's on or off and as you can
see<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.230> right<00:04:15.469> now<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:16.130> turn<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.489> on

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
see it's on right now just turn it on

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.009 
see it's on right now just turn it on
got<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.000> green<00:04:17.299> light<00:04:17.329> there<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:20.019> that's

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
got the green light there and that's

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.390 
got the green light there and that's
pretty<00:04:21.289> straightforward

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
pretty straightforward

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.070 
pretty straightforward
I<00:04:22.430> know<00:04:22.849> this<00:04:23.060> doesn't<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.509> apply<00:04:23.960> to

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
I know this doesn't really apply to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.860 
I know this doesn't really apply to
everybody<00:04:24.919> who<00:04:25.490> might<00:04:25.789> try<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.419> do<00:04:26.660> this

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
everybody who might try to do this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.650 
everybody who might try to do this
really<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.770> reason<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:29.180> everybody

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
really for the reason that not everybody

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.170 
really for the reason that not everybody
has<00:04:29.900> an<00:04:30.110> old<00:04:30.289> computer<00:04:31.160> laying<00:04:31.550> around<00:04:31.759> but

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
has an old computer laying around but

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.260 
has an old computer laying around but
this<00:04:32.659> is<00:04:32.720> definitely<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.260> good<00:04:33.440> way<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.650> do<00:04:33.889> it

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
this is definitely a good way to do it

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.300 
this is definitely a good way to do it
and<00:04:35.270> I've<00:04:36.020> heard<00:04:36.199> some<00:04:36.440> people<00:04:36.560> say<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.949> you

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
and I've heard some people say that you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.540 
and I've heard some people say that you
don't<00:04:37.460> get<00:04:37.610> enough<00:04:37.880> power<00:04:38.090> out<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.479> those<00:04:39.550> you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
don't get enough power out of those you

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.950 
don't get enough power out of those you
know<00:04:40.580> computer<00:04:41.180> supplies

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
know computer supplies

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.570 
know computer supplies
you<00:04:42.680> know<00:04:42.800> enough<00:04:43.550> amps<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.090> should<00:04:44.300> say<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:45.580> I

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
you know enough amps I should say and I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.560 
you know enough amps I should say and I
don't<00:04:46.849> know<00:04:46.940> I've<00:04:47.240> run<00:04:47.599> this<00:04:47.810> thing<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.530> a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
don't know I've run this thing for a

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.990 
don't know I've run this thing for a
long<00:04:50.570> time<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.560> pretty<00:04:51.860> loud<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.460> I've<00:04:52.610> never

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
long time and pretty loud and I've never
