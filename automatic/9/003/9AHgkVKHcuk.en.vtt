is<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.699> believe<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> best<00:00:21.990> method

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
is I believe this is the best method

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
want to be doing their Dark Brotherhood
quest<00:01:13.200> line<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.619> yourself<00:01:13.950> Shadowmere<00:01:14.549> I
