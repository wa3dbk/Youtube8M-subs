several people asked me the question as
a<00:00:10.679> result<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.190> video<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:11.910> earlier

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
a result of my video that I did earlier

a result of my video that I did earlier
today<00:00:13.070> about<00:00:14.070> tips<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.460> sleeping<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> they

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
today about tips for sleeping and they

today about tips for sleeping and they
asked<00:00:15.599> me<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> question<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:17.000> does<00:00:18.000> eating

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

carve<00:00:18.690> before<00:00:19.170> bed<00:00:19.460> affect<00:00:20.460> growth<00:00:20.970> hormone

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
carve before bed affect growth hormone

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.429 
carve before bed affect growth hormone
production<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.830> negative<00:00:23.369> way<00:00:23.600> which<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.289> me

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
production in a negative way which to me

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
production in a negative way which to me
this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.769> absurd<00:00:26.430> I've<00:00:26.760> never<00:00:27.240> heard<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this is absurd I've never heard this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.490 
this is absurd I've never heard this
before<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.689> first<00:00:30.900> question<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
before and the first question that I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
before and the first question that I
would<00:00:31.710> ask<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.130> why<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
would ask is why do you think that you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
would ask is why do you think that you
can<00:00:33.510> influence<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:34.200> growth<00:00:34.410> hormone<00:00:34.440> enough

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
can influence your growth hormone enough

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
can influence your growth hormone enough
to<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.700> affect<00:00:36.059> body<00:00:36.329> composition

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to actually affect body composition

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.889 
to actually affect body composition
muscle<00:00:37.380> mass<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.710> fat<00:00:37.890> gains<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.390> never

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
muscle mass or fat gains we have never

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.850 
muscle mass or fat gains we have never
once<00:00:40.350> found<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.370> study<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> correlated<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
once found a study that correlated it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.180 
once found a study that correlated it
with<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.489> rise<00:00:45.000> low<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:46.020> high<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> normal

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with any rise low or high in the normal

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.119 
with any rise low or high in the normal
range<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.820> affected<00:00:48.210> any<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.450> those<00:00:48.539> things

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
range that affected any of those things

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
range that affected any of those things
so<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.370> silly<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> worry

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so it's really silly for you to worry

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.100 
so it's really silly for you to worry
about<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.500> fact<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.550> inject<00:00:54.360> growth

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
about that in fact when we inject growth

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.200 
about that in fact when we inject growth
hormone<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> super<00:00:56.129> physiological<00:00:56.940> levels

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
hormone to super physiological levels
and<00:00:57.360> people<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.719> studies<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.800> not

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and people in studies and we do not

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
and people in studies and we do not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just the growth hormone they don't gain

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
people using it on its own but it does

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
people using it on its own but it does
not<00:01:30.150> improve<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.960> body<00:01:31.140> composition<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
not improve your body composition so you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.230 
not improve your body composition so you
shouldn't<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.310> worried<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.119> they

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
shouldn't be worried about that but they

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.170 
shouldn't be worried about that but they
answer<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> question<00:01:34.290> further<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:35.180> mentioned

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
answer the question further I mentioned

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.649 
answer the question further I mentioned

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
specifically melatonin that insulin

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
specifically melatonin that insulin
levels<00:01:40.590> rising<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> result<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> consuming

levels rising as a result of consuming

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.440 
levels rising as a result of consuming
carbs<00:01:42.780> before<00:01:42.869> bed<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.649> produce<00:01:44.450> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
carbs before bed can produce more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.039 
carbs before bed can produce more
melatonin<00:01:47.030> well<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> quite<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.780> few

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
melatonin well we have quite a few

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
melatonin well we have quite a few
studies<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:49.860> remember<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
studies and I don't remember the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
studies and I don't remember the
specifics<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.540> curious

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
specifics if you guys are really curious

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
specifics if you guys are really curious
Google<00:01:52.380> will<00:01:52.560> reveal<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Google will reveal this for you when we

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.520 
Google will reveal this for you when we
started<00:01:54.750> studying<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.140> back<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
started studying this back in the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.300 
started studying this back in the
nineties<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> administering<00:01:56.700> melatonin

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
nineties it administering melatonin

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.499 
nineties it administering melatonin
orally<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.490> boost<00:01:59.729> people's<00:01:59.909> melatonin

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
orally to boost people's melatonin

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
orally to boost people's melatonin
levels<00:02:01.079> showed<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:02.040> increasing<00:02:02.579> growth

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
levels showed an increasing growth

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
levels showed an increasing growth
hormone<00:02:03.060> release<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.630> wasn't<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
hormone release and it wasn't just a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.450 
hormone release and it wasn't just a
small<00:02:04.530> amount<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.100> quite<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
small amount it was quite a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
small amount it was quite a
statistically<00:02:06.299> significant<00:02:06.840> amount<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.200> don't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
statistically significant amount I don't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
statistically significant amount I don't
remember<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.039> percent<00:02:08.489> whether<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.000> 30

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
remember the percent whether it was 30

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.630 
remember the percent whether it was 30
percent<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.810> 50<00:02:10.080> percent<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.560> whatever<00:02:10.830> but

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
percent or 50 percent or whatever but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.830 
percent or 50 percent or whatever but
they<00:02:11.790> saw<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> couple

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
they saw for a couple

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.009 
they saw for a couple
a<00:02:12.870> spike<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:14.060> growth<00:02:15.060> hormone<00:02:15.420> production<00:02:15.720> as

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
a spike in growth hormone production as

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080 
a spike in growth hormone production as
a<00:02:16.050> result<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> administering<00:02:17.370> melatonin<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
a result of administering melatonin to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
a result of administering melatonin to
people<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.780> again<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> goes<00:02:19.379> back<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
people but again it goes back to the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.930 
people but again it goes back to the
thing<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.160> I'm<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.370> telling<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.819> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
thing if I'm not telling you that you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.910 
thing if I'm not telling you that you
need<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.209> go<00:02:21.330> consume<00:02:21.720> tons<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> melatonin

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
need to go consume tons of melatonin

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640 
need to go consume tons of melatonin
which<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.970> also<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.269> steroid<00:02:24.780> hormone<00:02:24.810> it's

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
which is also a steroid hormone it's

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
which is also a steroid hormone it's
again<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> hormone<00:02:26.250> your<00:02:26.370> body<00:02:26.580> produces<00:02:27.140> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
again a hormone your body produces just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.380 
again a hormone your body produces just
to<00:02:28.260> boost<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.860> HGH<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.819> again<00:02:30.180> it's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
to boost the HGH because again it's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.839 
to boost the HGH because again it's
unlikely<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> HTH<00:02:31.920> boost<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.459> going<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
unlikely that that HTH boost is going to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.550 
unlikely that that HTH boost is going to
be<00:02:32.970> significant<00:02:33.569> enough<00:02:33.900> positive<00:02:34.170> or

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
be significant enough positive or

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.860 
be significant enough positive or
negative<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> affect<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.540> probably

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
negative to affect you so you probably

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.490 
negative to affect you so you probably
don't<00:02:37.200> need<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.440> worry<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
don't need to worry about it but the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
don't need to worry about it but the
logic<00:02:40.890> would<00:02:41.010> dictate<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.549> since<00:02:42.239> we<00:02:42.420> know

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
logic would dictate that since we know

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
logic would dictate that since we know
the<00:02:42.720> insulin<00:02:43.260> increase<00:02:44.010> increases<00:02:44.519> melatonin

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
the insulin increase increases melatonin

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.210 
the insulin increase increases melatonin
and<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.360> melatonin<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.290> increase<00:02:46.680> HGH

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and we know melatonin can increase HGH

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.780 
and we know melatonin can increase HGH
the<00:02:48.140> answer<00:02:49.140> should<00:02:49.349> be<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> opposite<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the answer should be the opposite so I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.059 
the answer should be the opposite so I
have<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.660> no<00:02:52.079> idea<00:02:52.110> where<00:02:52.709> people

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
have really have no idea where people

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.069 
have really have no idea where people
got<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.489> other<00:02:53.700> idea<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.269> actually<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:55.019> this

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
got this other idea I actually at this

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.240 
got this other idea I actually at this
point<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.349> don't<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.650> care<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.040> just

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
point I don't really care it's just

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.970 
point I don't really care it's just
simply<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> worry<00:02:56.940> about<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.440> no<00:02:58.739> there's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
simply to worry about it but no there's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.259 
simply to worry about it but no there's
no<00:02:59.129> reason<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.549> think<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.760> eating<00:03:00.090> some

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
no reason to think that eating some

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.119 
no reason to think that eating some
carbs<00:03:00.569> before<00:03:00.720> bed<00:03:01.200> which<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.680> help<00:03:01.890> you

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
carbs before bed which can help you

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.800 
carbs before bed which can help you
sleep<00:03:02.400> through<00:03:02.730> their<00:03:02.849> hormone<00:03:03.180> release<00:03:03.540> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
sleep through their hormone release is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.979 
sleep through their hormone release is
going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.890> hurt<00:03:05.099> your<00:03:05.250> growth<00:03:05.459> hormone<00:03:05.879> levels

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
going to hurt your growth hormone levels

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.930 
going to hurt your growth hormone levels
or<00:03:06.989> particular<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.890> hurt<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.640> gains

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
or particular actually hurt your gains

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.729 
or particular actually hurt your gains
in<00:03:09.150> any<00:03:09.299> way<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> fact<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> exact<00:03:10.230> opposite

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
in any way in fact the exact opposite

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.770 
in any way in fact the exact opposite
should<00:03:10.950> occur<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.760> should<00:03:12.000> help<00:03:12.269> your<00:03:12.510> gains

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
should occur it should help your gains

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.259 
should occur it should help your gains
do<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> improve<00:03:13.950> sleep<00:03:14.280> all<00:03:14.910> right<00:03:14.940> yeah<00:03:15.209> so

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
do to improve sleep all right yeah so

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.580 
do to improve sleep all right yeah so
that's<00:03:15.510> really<00:03:15.810> all<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> have<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.260> say<00:03:16.440> on<00:03:16.560> that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that's really all I have to say on that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.349 
that's really all I have to say on that
today<00:03:16.889> I<00:03:16.920> hope<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.250> has<00:03:17.340> been<00:03:17.370> informative<00:03:17.519> and
