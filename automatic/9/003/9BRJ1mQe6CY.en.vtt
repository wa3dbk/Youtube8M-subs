sources<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> draw<00:01:35.220> another

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
sources that way if you draw another

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
sources that way if you draw another
saber<00:01:35.729> source<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.299> won't<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.720> essentially

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
saber source it won't be essentially

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.219 
saber source it won't be essentially
like<00:01:37.799> dead<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.790> let's<00:01:39.299> say<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.960> did

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
like dead because let's say that you did

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.940 
like dead because let's say that you did
go<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.450> let's<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> had<00:01:43.049> one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
go for a let's say that you had one

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
go for a let's say that you had one
super<00:01:44.189> sore<00:01:44.399> head<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> had<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.149> rabbit<00:01:45.570> like

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
super sore head you had one rabbit like

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
super sore head you had one rabbit like
it<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.350> matching<00:01:46.590> before<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> 1700

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it was matching before going for a 1700

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.520 
it was matching before going for a 1700
is<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.360> better<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.320> know

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is much better because that way you know

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
is much better because that way you know
you<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> chance<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> draw<00:01:50.759> 19-under<00:01:51.240> but

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you have a chance to draw 19-under but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
you have a chance to draw 19-under but
in<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.869> chance<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.130> case<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.610> don't

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
in this chance in this case you don't

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.010 
in this chance in this case you don't
want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> draw<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> nineteen<00:01:54.720> hundreds

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
want to draw the nineteen hundreds

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
want to draw the nineteen hundreds
because<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.159> drew<00:01:56.280> another

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
because you know if you drew another

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
because you know if you drew another
1900<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.540> access<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.990> rabbit<00:01:58.320> for

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
1900 you don't have access to rabbit for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.780 
1900 you don't have access to rabbit for
the<00:01:58.530> other<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.729> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the other two so what you want to do is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.160 
the other two so what you want to do is
you<00:01:59.820> want<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> wrap<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.630> other<00:02:00.810> ones

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you want to wrap it into the other ones

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
you want to wrap it into the other ones
that<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.610> happen<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> draw

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that way if you you know happen to draw

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.550 
that way if you you know happen to draw
one<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> already<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.530> your

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
one because you already have one in your

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.889 
one because you already have one in your
hand<00:02:04.909> yeah<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
hand yeah it's just better for you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.440 
hand yeah it's just better for you
another<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:08.129> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
another thing is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.229 
another thing is
when<00:02:10.450> um<00:02:11.190> let's<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.340> what<00:02:12.490> else<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:13.120> your

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
when um let's see what else when your

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.380 
when um let's see what else when your
opponent<00:02:13.510> has<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.900> spirit<00:02:14.620> reaper<00:02:14.770> don't<00:02:15.700> don't

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
opponent has a spirit reaper don't don't

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.479 
opponent has a spirit reaper don't don't
just<00:02:17.290> go<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.620> his<00:02:17.739> n<00:02:17.920> mains<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.250> then

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
just go for like his n mains and then

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.890 
just go for like his n mains and then
like<00:02:18.700> dark<00:02:18.910> hole<00:02:19.120> yourself<00:02:19.270> I've<00:02:19.599> seen<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.840> lot

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
like dark hole yourself I've seen a lot

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.870 
like dark hole yourself I've seen a lot
of<00:02:20.050> players<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.610> forget

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
of players like do that and they forget

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.490 
of players like do that and they forget
that<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.450> means<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.750> effect<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.140> mandatory

become<00:03:20.320> problematic<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.160> not<00:03:21.459> because<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
become problematic it's not because the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.420

deck<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> bad<00:03:22.359> it's<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.440> know<00:03:23.560> you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
