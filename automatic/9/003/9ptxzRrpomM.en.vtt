00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.330
 hi everyone today in the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 mega computer I will make you the 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.950
 demonstration of the year hen led 16 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 changing colors with functions 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 and his remote we start everything from 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 next on a blank and see it's not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 a white properly speaking because we have 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.330
 a little pink all that but it's not 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 so ugly 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.019
 so be careful though the same the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.449
 maximum brightness on the white you 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.739
 will not be able with them to a room of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.600
 10 square meters for example because 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 I remind you she does that 3 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 watts then on the remote so 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.370
 this remote there is a past 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 16 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.830
 we will be able to turn off or 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.729
 to light the bulbs 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.780
 be careful though if you want 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.210
 turn it on it would have to be your 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.450
 switches and closed the circuit so 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.190
 and the juice that arrives it makes sense 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.490
 you will also have the opportunity on 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.520
 white and all other colors 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.880
 to increase or decrease the brightness 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 and his two keys will serve as 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 second phase is in the functions 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.130
 who are here because they are going 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.700
 to increase or decrease the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 speed of change of colors so 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.160
 there I decrease to the maximum lÃ© in hen seen 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 that she was at the match and there he remains a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.020
 little something that the camera has to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020
 levy 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 we will go to the colors so some 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.650
 colors you will not see and I am 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.520
 excuse because the camera can not 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.789
 perceive the different shades 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 really where it gets too close so 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.069
 there we have red that obviously you 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.430
 see green and blue 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.690
 that's after that we had orange that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.159
 pulls the red I do not know if you 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.810
 see orange orange that pulls 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:33.200
 on the yellow is from Japan 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.940
 then we had blues that shoot on the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:44.620
 green of blue where there is still a little bit of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:52.580
 green of sky blue and very light blue 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:55.130
 then we have pink purple 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.209
 rose must pink fuchsia is a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 pink is clear and a run the neon pink 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.980
 we remain very very clear that's all for 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.650
 the colors 16 colors it goes very very 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.040
 quickly to show morning we will go to 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.100
 functions one will have the flash function which 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.580
 will use all the colors of this 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.650
 light bulb to make us like a spot to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.510
 this effect these two keys there as I 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.849
 says everything to allow them to increase 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.890
 or decrease the speed of change of 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.630
 colors so there for example I 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:33.950
 increase it thoroughly to him 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:36.049
 epilepsy is here I decrease then 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.670
 has the straub function that will use the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.140
 white light and only white 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.049
 to make us like a strobe 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.350
 normal so here we can increase or 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:50.750
 decrease the brightness speed 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:55.760
 parmain so here it's like a 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.739
 normal strobl then of that we have the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.790
 fed function that will serve us at a 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.459
 function of ambient light then 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.350
 increase the speed of change here 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.510
 will not serve any purpose simply because 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.400
 that it will do like the flash function 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.069
 and that's because we want 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.120
 may decrease the speed of change 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.139
 to really give us a light 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.169
 of atmosphere and lastly we have the 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:26.060
 function suffers who will use the green 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.130
 the blue the red like a real spot 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.889
 so there we can again increase or 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.160
 decrease the speed of change of 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.220
 color 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.710
 pay attention to epilepsy again 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.330
 so it's too fast 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.490
 this is a little too much supported 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 and there it is perfect for evenings a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.110
 it 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.520
 it's a good atmosphere that's all 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.290
 for the presentation of this light bulb 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.000
 without further ado I propose you to 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.590
 make a video to present the 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.920
 remote that I have very little 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:58.510
 present and and I tell you to everything from 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.310
 next in this video we will detail 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.440
 the remote so it's a good 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.890
 past 16 which I used in my 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.140
 video here we have the key that goes 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.850
 allow us to increase and here the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.190
 key that allows us to decrease the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.180
 brightness thereafter in the 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.520
 functions that will allow us 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.540
 to increase or decrease the change 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.280
 colors here we have the home button and 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.560
 the off key to allow us 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.090
 to turn on or off the bulbs 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.370
 from the remote control 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.050
 so be careful it seems logical but he 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.200
 must play come alan pulse if you 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.970
 want to use the option here are we 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.940
 so have the red the green the blue and 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.320
 the white on the same line and all the 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.550
 other colors that I already described 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.610
 in the video no we're not going 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.440
 linger 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.750
 on the functions side now we have the 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.180
 flash function that will use to the 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.520
 way of a spot all the colors of 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.230
 the hen on the strub key that goes 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.050
 allow us using the white of 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.810
 do like a strobe so on the 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.050
 function keys to increase or 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.350
 decrease the speed of change of 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.840
 color then we have the fed function which 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.250
 will allow us to do like a 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.610
 mood light with all the 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.220
 colors 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.300
 so here all increase the speed of 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.740
 color change is not used to 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.510
 big thing because if we know 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.960
 would be like flashing 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.700
 and that's because we want and last 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.190
 we have the touch of fun that will us 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.000
 allow to use the red the green the 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.030
 blue to make us like a spot and 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.470
 to make beautiful colors for beautiful 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.840
 eric nights of music etc 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.400
 that's all for the presentation of this 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.260
 remote control and this light bulb 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.730
 do not hesitate to comment rate the video 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.410
 if you did not understand something 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.640
 you can also visit them my 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.680
 website that appears here and if the 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.540
 heart tell you go watch the video of 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.620
 unpacking this bulb and it's me 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.449
 remains more than to tell you 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.449
 see you soon for new videos 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.689
 m
