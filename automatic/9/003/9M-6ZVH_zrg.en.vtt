00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
different drainage ditch we went back

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.890

the<00:03:21.230> next<00:03:21.290> morning<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.640> day<00:03:22.880> before<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.330> went<00:03:23.600> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
the next morning the day before I went a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.479 
the next morning the day before I went a
couple<00:03:24.110> times<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:24.590> no<00:03:24.680> camera<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.370> just

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
