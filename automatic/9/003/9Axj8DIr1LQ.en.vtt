00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
will work too so I like to wrap the yarn

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.580 
will work too so I like to wrap the yarn
over<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.540> pinch<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.350> feed

over it pinch it like that and then feed

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.340 
over it pinch it like that and then feed
it<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:41.690> feed<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it on look not like that feed it on that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100 
it on look not like that feed it on that
makes<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.800> easy<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.390> put<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
makes it really easy to put it into the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 
makes it really easy to put it into the
eye<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> needle<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.489> slide<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.090> close

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
eye of the needle so slide it down close

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.889 
eye of the needle so slide it down close
to<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> end<00:00:49.160> like<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> you'll<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
I've been dyeing yarn today and I did

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
I've been dyeing yarn today and I did
not<00:00:55.199> wear<00:00:55.350> gloves<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.250> why<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.489> hands

look like they do yep okay so you want

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
look like they do yep okay so you want
to<00:01:01.670> weave<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.969> needle<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to weave your needle in and out of the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
to weave your needle in and out of the
yarn<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.540> try<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.229> straight<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
yarn you can try to go straight down the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
yarn you can try to go straight down the
middle<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> yarn<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> more

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
middle of the yarn but it's more

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
middle of the yarn but it's more
difficult<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.240> crooked<00:01:12.600> needle

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
difficult and with my crooked needle

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
difficult and with my crooked needle
it's<00:01:12.990> hard<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's hard to do so you want to just

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
it's hard to do so you want to just
weave<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> through<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> little

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
weave it through like so do the little

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.390 
weave it through like so do the little
ooh<00:01:19.250> okay

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.870 

then<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.360> pull<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.870> up<00:01:24.460> grab<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.640> little

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
then you pull it up grab that little

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.100 
then you pull it up grab that little
loop<00:01:26.060> there<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.510> you've<00:01:26.600> made<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.320> pull

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
loop there that you've made and pull

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.660 
loop there that you've made and pull
pull<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.260> through<00:01:30.440> like<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.620> so<00:01:31.370> you<00:01:31.430> have<00:01:31.640> a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
pull it through like that so you have a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.900 
pull it through like that so you have a
little<00:01:31.880> loop<00:01:32.150> here<00:01:32.450> don't<00:01:33.200> lose<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.560> loop<00:01:33.910> now

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
little loop here don't lose the loop now

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.310 
little loop here don't lose the loop now
we're<00:01:35.060> going<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.270> do<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.510> same<00:01:35.690> thing<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
we're going to do the same thing on the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.860 
we're going to do the same thing on the
other<00:01:36.350> side<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:42.620> pinch<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.160> pop<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.730> on<00:01:43.880> okay

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
other side so pinch it pop it on okay

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.320 
other side so pinch it pop it on okay
but<00:01:45.050> before<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.470> start<00:01:45.530> with<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.280> one<00:01:46.520> you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
but before you start with this one you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.370 
but before you start with this one you
want<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.570> weave<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.990> through<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.830> loop<00:01:49.070> that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
want to weave it through the loop that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.050 
want to weave it through the loop that
you<00:01:51.380> just<00:01:51.410> made<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.100> other<00:01:52.310> end<00:01:54.369> okay<00:01:55.369> then

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
you just made on the other end okay then

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:14.090 
you just made on the other end okay then
you<00:01:56.180> do<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.450> same<00:01:56.630> thing<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.940> weave<00:01:59.210> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100 

okay<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.240> just<00:02:16.450> pull<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.930> right

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
okay and then you just pull that right

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.860 
okay and then you just pull that right
