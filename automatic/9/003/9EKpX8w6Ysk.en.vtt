in<00:05:52.780> regards<00:05:53.290> to<00:05:53.500> zombies<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.920> definitely<00:05:54.250> think

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
in regards to zombies I definitely think

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.790 
in regards to zombies I definitely think
this<00:05:54.760> would<00:05:54.970> be<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.180> warm<00:05:55.510> welcome<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.200> think

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
this would be a warm welcome I think

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.460 
this would be a warm welcome I think
that<00:05:57.040> track<00:05:57.630> zombies<00:05:58.630> has<00:05:58.780> got<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.200> much

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
that track zombies has got that much

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.860 
that track zombies has got that much
momentum<00:05:59.740> that<00:06:00.640> I<00:06:00.700> can't<00:06:01.120> really<00:06:01.510> do<00:06:01.690> the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
momentum that I can't really do the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.900 
momentum that I can't really do the
traditional<00:06:02.080> teasers<00:06:03.010> slashing<00:06:03.550> on<00:06:03.670> one

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
traditional teasers slashing on one

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.090 
traditional teasers slashing on one
trailer<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.570> then<00:06:04.990> leave<00:06:05.230> zombies<00:06:05.680> into<00:06:05.980> the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
trailer and then leave zombies into the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.310 
trailer and then leave zombies into the
game's<00:06:06.340> release<00:06:06.550> I<00:06:06.820> think<00:06:07.120> that<00:06:07.390> these<00:06:07.870> on<00:06:08.140> biz

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
game's release I think that these on biz

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.500 
game's release I think that these on biz
presence<00:06:08.890> especially<00:06:09.130> within<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.910> community

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
presence especially within the community

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.900 
presence especially within the community
is<00:06:10.750> definitely<00:06:11.560> massive<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.460> course<00:06:12.700> I

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
is definitely massive and of course I

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.090 
is definitely massive and of course I
think<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.480> possibly<00:06:13.750> more<00:06:14.350> people<00:06:14.740> might<00:06:14.950> be

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
think that possibly more people might be

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.100 
think that possibly more people might be
interested<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:15.700> zombies<00:06:16.120> this<00:06:16.330> year<00:06:16.630> then
