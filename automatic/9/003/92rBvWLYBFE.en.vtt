5 connector which made it interesting

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900 
5 connector which made it interesting
for<00:00:48.570> me<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.140> reasons<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.730> they<00:00:50.730> means

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
for me for two reasons one they means

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
for me for two reasons one they means
that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> wake<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> music<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.079> your

iPhone<00:00:52.649> 5<00:00:53.059> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.239> better<00:00:54.480> quality

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
iPhone 5 which is a better quality

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
iPhone 5 which is a better quality
speaker<00:00:55.170> than<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.710> iPhone<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
speaker than what your iPhone is so you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.099 
speaker than what your iPhone is so you
kind<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> enjoy<00:00:57.300> waking<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:57.930> bit

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
kind of enjoy waking up a little bit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.020 
kind of enjoy waking up a little bit
more<00:00:58.289> than<00:00:58.500> normal

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
more than normal

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
more than normal
secondly<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.660> charges<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.230> iPhone<00:01:01.649> which

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
secondly it charges your iPhone which

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
secondly it charges your iPhone which
kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> displaces<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> whole<00:01:03.899> idea<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
kind of displaces the whole idea of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
kind of displaces the whole idea of
having<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> charged<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> separate<00:01:05.909> cable

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
having it charged with a separate cable

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
having it charged with a separate cable
on<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.510> bedside<00:01:07.080> table<00:01:07.470> anyway<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.580> it's

got a large snooze button as well which

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
got a large snooze button as well which
if<00:01:10.799> you've<00:01:11.220> woken<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.060> iPhone

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
if you've woken up with your iPhone

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
if you've woken up with your iPhone
before<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.619> playing<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.040> can

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
before you know how I'm playing it can

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
before you know how I'm playing it can
be<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.430> try<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> silence<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> turn<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.720> off

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
be to try and silence it and turn it off

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
be to try and silence it and turn it off
so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> Handy<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:19.020> was

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so that was kind of Handy but that was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
so that was kind of Handy but that was
the<00:01:19.200> biggest<00:01:19.380> feature<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:20.310> obviously<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the biggest feature now obviously when I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310 
the biggest feature now obviously when I
started<00:01:21.060> looking<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> okay<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> look

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
started looking at it okay well I look

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.890 
started looking at it okay well I look
at<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> clock<00:01:22.680> radio<00:01:22.830> should<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.340> try<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
at a clock radio should actually try and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
at a clock radio should actually try and
seriously<00:01:24.900> look<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:26.040> key<00:01:26.280> features

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
seriously look at one two key features
on<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.150> enjoyed<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> jewel

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
on it which I enjoyed was the jewel

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
on it which I enjoyed was the jewel
alarm<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.070> quite<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> fact<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> can

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
