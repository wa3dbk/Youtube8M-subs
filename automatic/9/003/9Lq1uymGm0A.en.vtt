hey welcome back all today I'll be
showing<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.149> portal<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
showing you how to make a portal to the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.559 
showing you how to make a portal to the
nether<00:00:04.190> all<00:00:05.190> right<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:05.640> they're<00:00:05.879> obviously

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
nether all right so they're obviously

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.570 
nether all right so they're obviously
multiple<00:00:07.140> ways<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.560> making<00:00:07.859> portals<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
multiple ways of making portals to the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.000 
multiple ways of making portals to the
nether<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> easiest<00:00:10.019> ways<00:00:10.200> obviously<00:00:10.500> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
nether the easiest ways obviously to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.250 
nether the easiest ways obviously to
collect<00:00:11.340> some<00:00:11.580> obsidian<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.309> make<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.639> four

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
collect some obsidian and make it four

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.300 
collect some obsidian and make it four
across<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.410> five<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> down<00:00:17.820> 2<00:00:18.480> 3<00:00:18.990> 4<00:00:19.439> 5<00:00:21.800> 2<00:00:22.800> 3

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
across and five up and down 2 3 4 5 2 3

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.420 
across and five up and down 2 3 4 5 2 3
4<00:00:23.699> 5<00:00:24.320> now<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> only<00:00:25.560> problem<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> way

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
4 5 now the only problem with this way

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
4 5 now the only problem with this way
is<00:00:26.699> sometimes<00:00:27.539> people<00:00:27.869> don't<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.140> diamond

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is sometimes people don't have diamond

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.250 
is sometimes people don't have diamond
pics<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.250> wasting<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.869> willing<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
pics or not wasting are not willing to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.250 
pics or not wasting are not willing to
waste<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:33.300> obviously<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.840> simpler

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
waste them so you obviously need simpler

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.080 
waste them so you obviously need simpler
way<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:35.880> using

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
way to do this and that is by using

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.959 
way to do this and that is by using
buckets<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.809> lava<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.430> way<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> make

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
buckets of lava so the way to make

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
buckets of lava so the way to make
obsidian<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.670> need<00:00:41.850> lava<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.129> still

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
obsidian is you need lava that is still

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
obsidian is you need lava that is still
so<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.809> make<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.320> little<00:00:46.680> hole

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so you can do is you make a little hole

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.479 
so you can do is you make a little hole
here<00:00:47.390> actually<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.539> make<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:49.050> cross

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
here actually you can make you for cross

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.840 
here actually you can make you for cross
because<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.059> dimensions<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> need

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
because that's the dimensions you need

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:03.770 
because that's the dimensions you need
three<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:57.140> three<00:01:02.090> alright<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.420> four

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
three for three alright so that's four

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
three for three alright so that's four
right<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
right there then we're you're going to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
right there then we're you're going to
want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> need<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.840> four

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
want to do is you need to put four

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
want to do is you need to put four
buckets<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> lava<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> middle

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
buckets of lava right in the middle

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.710 
buckets of lava right in the middle
there<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> sloping

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
there and as you can see this is sloping

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
there and as you can see this is sloping
down<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> were<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.920> water<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
down so if you were to put water on this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.149 
down so if you were to put water on this
at<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> moment<00:01:15.330> um<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.439> work<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
at the moment um it would not work and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.030 
at the moment um it would not work and
it<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:17.520> turn<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.240> cobblestone

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
it would only turn into cobblestone

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600 
it would only turn into cobblestone
however<00:01:20.090> because<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.600> almost<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.400> see<00:01:23.400> now

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
however because I almost have see now

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
however because I almost have see now
it's<00:01:23.790> completely<00:01:24.210> still<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.890> water

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it's completely still so if I put water

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's completely still so if I put water
near<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.270> actually<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.820> turn<00:01:29.820> into

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
near it it's actually going to turn into

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
near it it's actually going to turn into
obsidian

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 

so<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.220> saw<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> made<00:01:41.820> forbes

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so as you just saw that made forbes

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
so as you just saw that made forbes
singing<00:01:42.570> box<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> build<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.310> where

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
singing box now to build it up where

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
singing box now to build it up where
you're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.150> is<00:01:45.299> around<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you're going to need to do is around the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.710 
you're going to need to do is around the
end<00:01:46.530> blocks<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.330> would<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
end blocks here so this would be the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
end blocks here so this would be the
second<00:01:49.140> block<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.670> you're<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> need<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
second block I you're going to need to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
second block I you're going to need to
put<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.080> lava<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.520> water

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:55.790 

you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.040 

so<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> fifth<00:02:57.360> now<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:57.900> I'm

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
so this is the fifth now and then I'm

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.110 
so this is the fifth now and then I'm
going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.410> start<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.730> side<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
going to have to start on that side and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.800 
going to have to start on that side and
build<00:03:00.510> up<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.990> then<00:03:01.290> go<00:03:01.500> across<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:05.690> mean<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
build up and then go across I mean the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.480 
build up and then go across I mean the
great<00:03:06.960> thing<00:03:07.200> about<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.440> method<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.130> it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
great thing about this method is it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.030 
great thing about this method is it
doesn't<00:03:08.880> require<00:03:09.120> diamonds<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.560> downside

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
doesn't require diamonds on the downside

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.060 
doesn't require diamonds on the downside
though<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.400> takes<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.380> lava<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.770> water

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
though it takes a lot of lava and water

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.100 
though it takes a lot of lava and water
which<00:03:14.820> could<00:03:15.090> mean<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.300> lot<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.510> trips<00:03:15.840> back<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
which could mean a lot of trips back and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.580 
which could mean a lot of trips back and
forth<00:03:16.410> if<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> lava<00:03:18.150> source<00:03:18.590> on

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
forth if you don't have a lava source on

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.900 
forth if you don't have a lava source on
near<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.070> top<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.780> where<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.020> are<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.730> we're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
near the top of where you are so we're

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.460 
near the top of where you are so we're
going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> move<00:03:24.240> on<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.630> next<00:03:24.660> now<00:03:25.110> over

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
going to move on to the next now over

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.890 
going to move on to the next now over
here<00:03:25.800> we<00:03:26.870> build<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
here we build up like this so this is a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.400 
here we build up like this so this is a
second<00:03:31.830> high<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.600> now<00:03:33.600> if<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.840> want<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.170> try

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
second high and now if you want to try

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.760 
second high and now if you want to try
to<00:03:34.470> cheat<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.100> little<00:03:35.520> go<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:36.060> above

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
to cheat this little go like above

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.980 
to cheat this little go like above
remember<00:03:37.770> lava<00:03:38.100> down<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:39.270> like<00:03:39.630> about<00:03:39.840> two

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
remember lava down for like about two

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.680 
remember lava down for like about two
blocks<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.520> doesn't<00:03:41.760> work<00:03:42.090> either<00:03:42.330> so

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
blocks this that doesn't work either so

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.950 
blocks this that doesn't work either so
you<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.960> do<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.110> one<00:03:43.380> by<00:03:43.560> one<00:03:43.800> going<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.960> so

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
you have to do a one by one going up so

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.450 
you have to do a one by one going up so
there's<00:03:46.140> really<00:03:46.260> nowhere<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.680> cheat<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.220> in

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
there's really nowhere to cheat this in

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.910 
there's really nowhere to cheat this in
that<00:03:47.640> respect<00:03:48.090> which<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.960> a<00:03:48.990> little<00:03:49.680> bit<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.860> a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
that respect which is a little bit of a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:53.370 
that respect which is a little bit of a
disappointment

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.670 

ok<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.310> now<00:04:54.730> I'm<00:04:54.940> five<00:04:55.270> blocks<00:04:55.570> high<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.200> would

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
ok so now I'm five blocks high I would

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.550 
ok so now I'm five blocks high I would
have<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.950> do<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.250> go<00:04:57.490> across<00:04:57.760> now<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:59.290> what<00:04:59.470> I'm

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
have to do is go across now so what I'm

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.690 
have to do is go across now so what I'm
going<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.740> want<00:04:59.890> to<00:05:00.010> do<00:05:00.130> is<00:05:00.250> I'm<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.520> want

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
going to want to do is I'm going to want

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.270 
going to want to do is I'm going to want
to<00:05:00.790> build<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.420> little<00:05:02.170> trench<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.680> either<00:05:02.890> side

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
to build a little trench on either side

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.060 
to build a little trench on either side
to<00:05:03.460> keep<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.850> lava<00:05:04.120> from<00:05:04.420> going<00:05:04.720> down<00:05:05.070> then

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
to keep the lava from going down then

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.920 
to keep the lava from going down then
just<00:05:06.100> like<00:05:06.700> before<00:05:06.910> on<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> bottom<00:05:07.600> I'm<00:05:07.780> just

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
just like before on the bottom I'm just

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.510 
just like before on the bottom I'm just
going<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.140> put<00:05:08.200> two<00:05:08.470> things<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:08.860> lava<00:05:09.100> in<00:05:09.310> here

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
going to put two things in lava in here

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.330 
going to put two things in lava in here
and<00:05:10.000> then<00:05:10.120> put<00:05:10.300> water<00:05:10.540> on<00:05:10.690> top<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.350> quench<00:05:12.160> it

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
and then put water on top to quench it

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.690 
and then put water on top to quench it
and<00:05:12.520> turning<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.850> new<00:05:12.970> obsidian<00:05:14.490> after<00:05:15.490> that

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
and turning a new obsidian after that

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.920 
and turning a new obsidian after that
you've<00:05:15.850> pretty<00:05:16.060> much<00:05:16.150> done<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.660> hard<00:05:16.870> part

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
you've pretty much done the hard part
