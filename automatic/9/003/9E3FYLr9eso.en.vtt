how<00:00:19.100> does<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.370> old<00:00:19.490> eq<00:00:19.910> shit<00:00:20.120> he's<00:00:20.240> done<00:00:20.420> sound

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
how does the old eq shit he's done sound

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.890 
how does the old eq shit he's done sound
so<00:00:21.440> it's<00:00:21.530> really<00:00:21.680> good<00:00:21.950> it's<00:00:22.100> pretty<00:00:22.610> minimal

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
so it's really good it's pretty minimal

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.310 
so it's really good it's pretty minimal
it's<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.650> little<00:00:25.010> bit<00:00:25.300> in<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.570> bottom<00:00:26.960> as

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
it's just a little bit in the bottom as

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.160 
it's just a little bit in the bottom as
in<00:00:27.680> hundred<00:00:28.400> cycles<00:00:28.640> but<00:00:29.119> that<00:00:29.660> varies<00:00:30.020> from

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
in hundred cycles but that varies from

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.770 
in hundred cycles but that varies from
