00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
of the screen to make it a little bit

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.460 
of the screen to make it a little bit
easier<00:05:18.639> on<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.030> eyes<00:05:19.210> as<00:05:19.510> you're<00:05:19.960> reading<00:05:20.169> I

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
easier on the eyes as you're reading I

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.690 
easier on the eyes as you're reading I
also<00:05:20.770> want<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:20.979> mention<00:05:21.039> that<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.400> screen<00:05:21.639> has

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
also want to mention that the screen has

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.000 
also want to mention that the screen has
a<00:05:21.910> flicker<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.539> safe<00:05:22.870> reader<00:05:23.289> mode<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:23.860> that's

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
a flicker of safe reader mode so that's

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.379 
a flicker of safe reader mode so that's
going<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.220> reduce<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.580> screen<00:05:24.850> flicker<00:05:25.150> to

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
going to reduce the screen flicker to

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.120 
going to reduce the screen flicker to
reduce<00:05:25.660> eyestrain<00:05:25.930> while<00:05:26.800> you're<00:05:26.949> actually

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
reduce eyestrain while you're actually

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.939 
reduce eyestrain while you're actually
using<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.910> monitor<00:05:28.620> also<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:29.680> can<00:05:29.919> use

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
using the monitor also you can use

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.580 
using the monitor also you can use
