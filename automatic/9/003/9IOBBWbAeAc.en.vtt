00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
one place put this in a real-life

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.480 
one place put this in a real-life
context<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:25.860> take<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> look<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:43.950 

they<00:02:30.490> say<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.810> works<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:35.730> reproduction

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.190 

the<00:02:44.960> worst
