00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.570 

today<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.829> talk<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.310> pressure

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
today we're going to talk about pressure

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.329 
today we're going to talk about pressure
regulators<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:03.840> let's<00:00:04.080> remember<00:00:04.290> that<00:00:05.250> we

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
regulators but let's remember that we

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.760 
regulators but let's remember that we
have<00:00:05.490> pipe<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.210> basically<00:00:06.750> male<00:00:07.200> threads

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
have pipe that is basically male threads

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.339 
have pipe that is basically male threads
on<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.069> outside<00:00:08.630> so<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
on the outside so that you can have a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.190 
on the outside so that you can have a
connection<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> female<00:00:12.509> thread<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
connection with the female thread and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.939 
connection with the female thread and
the<00:00:13.830> female<00:00:14.219> threads<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.080> inside<00:00:16.619> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the female threads are on the inside of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.200 
the female threads are on the inside of
the<00:00:17.460> pipe<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.050> that's<00:00:19.050> where<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.680> inject<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the pipe and that's where we inject the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.810 
the pipe and that's where we inject the
male<00:00:21.420> threads<00:00:21.980> now<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> pressure<00:00:23.460> regulator

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
male threads now the pressure regulator

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
male threads now the pressure regulator
looks<00:00:24.300> something<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
looks something like this this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
looks something like this this
particular<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> senator<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.650> senator

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
particular one is senator and senator

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
particular one is senator and senator
makes<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.160> best<00:00:29.369> quality<00:00:30.029> pressure<00:00:30.630> regular

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
makes the best quality pressure regular

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.220 
makes the best quality pressure regular
I<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.969> don't<00:00:32.969> work<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> company<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I know of I don't work for the company I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530 
I know of I don't work for the company I
don't<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.739> money<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> love<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> pressure

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
don't make money but I love the pressure

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
don't make money but I love the pressure
regulator<00:00:36.930> reason<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.129> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
regulator reason that this is so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
regulator reason that this is so
important<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.500> bolted

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
important is that it's it's bolted

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
important is that it's it's bolted
together<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.610> heavy-duty<00:00:41.969> plastic<00:00:42.360> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
together it's heavy-duty plastic it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.040 
together it's heavy-duty plastic it's
thick<00:00:43.170> walls<00:00:43.789> it<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.360> any<00:00:45.629> amount<00:00:45.719> of

thick walls it can take any amount of
use<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.530> fact<00:00:46.800> we're<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> try<00:00:47.760> driving

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
use in fact we're going to try driving

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.400 
use in fact we're going to try driving
over<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.870> happens

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.890 

holy<00:00:57.980> Toledo<00:00:58.400> it's<00:00:59.030> still<00:00:59.360> in<00:00:59.570> shape<00:00:59.870> that

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
holy Toledo it's still in shape that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.569 
holy Toledo it's still in shape that
didn't<00:01:00.500> crack

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
didn't crack

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
didn't crack
fantastic<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> pressure<00:01:04.470> regulators

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
fantastic now the pressure regulators

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
fantastic now the pressure regulators
got<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.280> come<00:01:05.570> after<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.260> filter<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> we

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
got to come after the filter that we

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.960 
got to come after the filter that we
talked<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.369> before<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:10.400> for<00:01:11.400> two<00:01:11.550> reasons

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
talked about before and for two reasons

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
talked about before and for two reasons
one<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.850> filter<00:01:15.300> has<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.690> have<00:01:15.930> full<00:01:16.770> house

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
one the filter has to have full house

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.430 
one the filter has to have full house
pressure<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:18.000> usually<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.510> 60<00:01:18.869> pounds<00:01:19.290> per

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
pressure which usually is 60 pounds per

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.140 
pressure which usually is 60 pounds per
square<00:01:19.470> inch<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.640> turn<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
square inch so that we can turn this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
square inch so that we can turn this
valve<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> flush<00:01:22.530> dirt<00:01:23.130> off<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.030> filter<00:01:25.100> then

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
valve and flush dirt off the filter then

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.040 
valve and flush dirt off the filter then
we<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.490> need<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.780> pressure

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
we also need a have the pressure

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.950 
we also need a have the pressure
regulator<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:29.369> between<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.750> drip

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
regulator in between this and the drip

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
regulator in between this and the drip
fittings<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.040> drip<00:01:32.280> irrigation

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
fittings because the drip irrigation

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.469 
fittings because the drip irrigation
fittings<00:01:33.390> tend<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.140> blow<00:01:34.320> apart<00:01:34.740> after<00:01:35.430> 40<00:01:36.090> 45

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
fittings tend to blow apart after 40 45

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.350 
fittings tend to blow apart after 40 45
psi<00:01:37.110> pounds<00:01:37.530> per<00:01:37.740> square<00:01:37.860> inch<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.000> want<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
psi pounds per square inch so we want to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160 
psi pounds per square inch so we want to
keep<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.960> fittings<00:01:40.320> below<00:01:41.479> 45<00:01:42.479> pounds<00:01:42.990> per

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
keep those fittings below 45 pounds per

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
keep those fittings below 45 pounds per
square<00:01:43.200> inch<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
square inch so we have to have this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
square inch so we have to have this
pressure<00:01:45.750> regulator<00:01:46.380> attached<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
pressure regulator attached to the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.770 
pressure regulator attached to the
filter<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.920> filter<00:01:50.600> there's<00:01:51.600> always

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
an arrow that tells you what direction

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.660 
an arrow that tells you what direction
to<00:01:54.330> put<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> filter<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.399> pressure

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to put the filter and on the pressure

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.669 
to put the filter and on the pressure
regulator<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.600> always<00:01:57.810> an<00:01:58.080> arrow<00:01:58.289> that

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679

metal I say get the middle cost more but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
metal I say get the middle cost more but
it<00:02:49.010> really<00:02:49.400> make<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.640> difference<00:02:49.760> over<00:02:50.420> the
