it's a higher protein content really for
african-american<00:02:40.020> hair<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.620> strip

the protein out our hair when when we
relax<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.430> has<00:02:44.550> more<00:02:44.760> protein<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
relax it so it has more protein in it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020 
relax it so it has more protein in it
than<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.290> ordinary<00:02:46.770> coconut<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.910> can
