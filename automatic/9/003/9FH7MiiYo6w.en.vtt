 walk along with doctor's division 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.560

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.899

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:14.849
 Doctor Digi is very handy 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.269
 for example you can do the assignments from the law book 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.699
 large on the whiteboard that makes it a lot easier 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.789
 to explain in class without econo on the bar 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.589
 and under the hand you have an extra exercise that is not in the book 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.589
 they see the toes whether they are right or not 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 set 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.700

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.750
 a lot 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 to talk about 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.790

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.420
 play with words but also during the spelling lesson 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.370

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440
