all those things have gone well so I am
certainly<00:01:58.049> happy<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> slow

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
certainly happy with that it is a slow

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.700 
certainly happy with that it is a slow
process<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.320> something<00:02:01.530> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
process and it's not something that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.670 
process and it's not something that's
done<00:02:01.950> overnight<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> can't<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.439> sure<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
done overnight and you can't be sure of
it<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.430> certainly<00:02:05.579> hope<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.210> over

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it but I would certainly hope that over
