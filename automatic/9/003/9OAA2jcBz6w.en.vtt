00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.009

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.259
 I am sony cepit fan and today I am going to 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.750
 mention some curiosities of the game 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.080
 sonic heroes or as I declared one of 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.879
 my favorite games of all life 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.830
 clarifying all this this information the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.180
 Remove the sony wii from visiting your page 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.990
 and blah blah blah 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.060
 let's start 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.220
 in the first level in order that I 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.800
 tics in seaside the char tells me something 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.430
 yes yes yes but I may say 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 either sea or in English if you go with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 the character speed very fast and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.670
 you stop moving the analog stick on 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.580
 character will continue to run sometimes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.980
 even falls to the void with the team rose and 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.140
 puts their voices in Japanese when using 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.300
 cream at the moment it's going to fly says 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 a phrase something like that with imos that in 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.700
 Spanish means eating the speed of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 the speed is the same as the flight time 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.650
 of the fly is the same but the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.540
 powers of the powers are different 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.550
 shadow at the end of team gac tells you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 to rich after she says I'll be back 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.690
 for the emeral master nothing has changed 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 but rus in no time of the game 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.520
 said she was a jewelry thief and in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.720
 rus changes costume curiously 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 only in this game 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 this game had many sales even 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.369
 many on playstation 2 a weird thing 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 is that metal sonic here can change 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.730
 shape 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.100

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.680
