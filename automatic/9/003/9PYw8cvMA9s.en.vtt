a<00:02:27.420> couple<00:02:28.320> things<00:02:28.440> I've<00:02:28.650> learned<00:02:28.680> over<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
a couple things I've learned over the

a couple things I've learned over the
years<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.450> separate<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.720> decoys<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.830> some

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
years that separate my decoys from some

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.590 
years that separate my decoys from some
of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.280> other<00:02:32.310> taxidermy<00:02:32.970> decoys<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.510> the

of the other taxidermy decoys on the
market<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.080> main<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.560> probably<00:02:35.310> being<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
market the main one probably being the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.760 
market the main one probably being the
posture<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> bird<00:02:36.540> through<00:02:37.410> trial<00:02:37.650> and

posture of the bird through trial and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.990 
posture of the bird through trial and
error<00:02:37.920> I've<00:02:38.160> kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.430> figured<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.970> best

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
error I've kind of figured out the best

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.570 
error I've kind of figured out the best
posture<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> Jake<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:41.130> draw<00:02:41.340> those

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.240 
them that you have to carry in and out
of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> field<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.470> make<00:03:19.590> some<00:03:19.800> cumbersome

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
of the field and make some cumbersome

of the field and make some cumbersome
these<00:03:20.460> just<00:03:20.730> work<00:03:21.210> a<00:03:21.330> lot<00:03:21.510> better

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.910 

I<00:03:49.840> developed<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> decoy<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.349> of<00:03:51.590> necessity

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
I developed the decoy out of necessity

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.770 
I developed the decoy out of necessity
for<00:03:52.370> bow<00:03:52.550> hunting<00:03:52.849> I<00:03:52.970> needed<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.360> get<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.599> bird

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
for bow hunting I needed to get the bird

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.020 
for bow hunting I needed to get the bird
in<00:03:53.930> close<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.590> hold<00:03:55.160> him<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.370> until<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.819> got

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
in close and hold him there until I got

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.970 
in close and hold him there until I got
just<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.360> right<00:03:56.420> shot<00:03:56.780> angle<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.379> was<00:03:57.830> able

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
just the right shot angle and was able

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.619 
just the right shot angle and was able
to<00:03:58.129> get<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.310> shot<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.879> works<00:03:59.180> great<00:03:59.360> for

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
to get a shot and it works great for

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.750 
to get a shot and it works great for
that<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.410> obviously<00:04:01.099> if<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.340> works<00:04:01.519> good<00:04:01.730> for

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that but obviously if it works good for

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.309 
that but obviously if it works good for
that<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.239> works<00:04:02.390> good<00:04:02.540> for<00:04:02.599> shotgun<00:04:03.110> hunting

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
that it works good for shotgun hunting

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.289 
that it works good for shotgun hunting
too<00:04:03.620> especially<00:04:04.519> if<00:04:04.580> you're<00:04:04.700> taking<00:04:04.849> a<00:04:05.060> youth
