00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
that's heavily heavily swatched but when

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.770 
that's heavily heavily swatched but when
you<00:06:07.260> share<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.160> out<00:06:08.310> like<00:06:09.300> you<00:06:09.450> would<00:06:09.600> with<00:06:09.750> a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
you share it out like you would with a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.280 
you share it out like you would with a
blush<00:06:10.260> brush<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:11.370> is<00:06:11.910> definitely<00:06:12.420> a<00:06:12.630> skin<00:06:13.050> tone

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
blush brush it is definitely a skin tone

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.810

it's<00:06:13.470> just<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.680> little<00:06:13.800> darker<00:06:14.280> and<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.460> think<00:06:14.700> it

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
it's just a little darker and I think it

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.300 
it's just a little darker and I think it
makes<00:06:14.970> it<00:06:15.510> works<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.930> lot<00:06:16.110> better<00:06:16.170> I<00:06:16.620> think<00:06:17.190> it

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
makes it works a lot better I think it

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.330 
makes it works a lot better I think it
works<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.550> lot<00:06:17.640> better<00:06:17.700> for<00:06:18.030> me<00:06:18.150> for<00:06:18.360> contouring
