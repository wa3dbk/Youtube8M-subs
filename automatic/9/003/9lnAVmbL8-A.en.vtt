00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hi, friends, Miguel, for a revolution and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.180
 I'm going to start this video by making them a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.429
 question will be a good idea to run if 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.929
 Our goal is to lose weight 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.670
 who can tell us that if there are some 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.469
 You can say no for X or because 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.230
 surely everyone has their idea 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.400
 have an answer to this question and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 in this video I will be 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.619
 developing my answer and because 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 now let's break down several points 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.480
 one first of all how many calories are 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.510
 burn for running and this is a number 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 very variable it can be from 50 up 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.640
 2,500 calories or more and what will 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.520
 depend on this figure will depend one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the body weight of the person two of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 the distance traveled and three of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.789
 speed with which this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.950
 distance for example a person of 50 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.719
 kilos traveling the same distance in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 the same time as a person of 100 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 kilos then the 50 kilos will have 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.250
 lower energy expenditure than 100 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.690
 kilos is not so much the difference but yes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.489
 it's a considerable difference that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have to take into account and this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.500
 number will be very variable now if 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.330
 I have to give an approximate that would be 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310
 very risky but if I have to say 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.540
 a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 I would say 250 kilo calories now can 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.770
 depend I repeat but we are also 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.299
 talking about a person that surely 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.310
 does not have a great physical condition 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.619
 then it will not run much nor will it 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.080
 run very fast and surely it's not 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.299
 training to become a marathon runner or 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.950
 to run a marathon surely if your 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.720
 goal is to lose weight this is something 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.119
 that probably will not happen then 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.090
 250 calories would be a good approximate 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.060
 point number 2 the feed if the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 person that our 250 calories and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.390
 then he goes to eat and retrieves it in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 foods that are not going to be very 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.289
 nutritionally rich then better 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.360
 do not do anything to the person because 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.220
 these same 250 calories that just 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 burn is recovering them and in 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 question of energy balance we are 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.289
 leaving tables this is better than not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.909
 do anything you do not waste time 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.890
 person because it will stay the same for 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.110
 that goes to run health for the effects 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.849
 of cardiovascular benefits that I'm 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.159
 leaving aside if the person wants 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.560
 lose weight then it will not serve 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.739
 nothing if you eat recover 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.840
 what just running in food 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.770
 who is eating this is a point that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.060
 you have to take into account the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.340
 23 power when we run 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.560
 we are not having the right encouragement 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
 so that our muscle grows and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.769
 we want our muscle 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.200
 grow especially a person who has 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.250
 been in physical activity for a long time 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.709
 time wants this person needs and you 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.900
 would greatly benefit increase your 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.610
 muscle mass since the hormonal change 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.620
 that is generated will be of great help 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 so that the person can have a better 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.000
 state of health and so that the person 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.100
 can burn more calories by the simple 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.049
 fact of being alive and by the simple 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000
 done doing their activities 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.560
 metabolic of the day with day as 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.540
 breathe that our heart can 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.400
 etcetera etcetera the body is going to burn 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 a little more calories the more 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 have muscle and run is not a 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.840
 activity that stimulates growth 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.540
 muscle and it's something that you have to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.690
 take into account and 4 make the distinction 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.540
 between losing weight or losing fat if 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.600
 a person starts to run then it is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.400
 very likely to lower your musculature and 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.400
 it's something we do not want to go for 7 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.230
 little muscle the person and lowers even more 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.379
 then the hormonal profiles very 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.110
 are likely to be modified in a 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.879
 way not very favorable then not 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.860
 we want this to happen we do not want that 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.390
 lower our musculature because it comes from 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.040
 the hand with what is known as the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.709
 rebound effect that is when people 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.470
 they lose weight and then they go up 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.480
 they even go up a little more than what 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.099
 they thought before and it's something that we do not believe 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.989
 are these four points that we have to 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.579
 take into account then what would be my 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.010
 answer would be a good idea to run for 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.019
 lose weight not if what you want is 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.799
 lose weight then instead of running 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.799
 You can reduce your energy consumption and 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.379
 ready is what you need to get off 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.480
 weight is not ideal, I recommend a 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.939
 strength training a workout 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.109
 that stimulates muscle growth and 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.939
 when I say this, the people 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.650
 imagine that they have to be very 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.269
 muscular and not far from the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.340
 reality simply have more 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.290
 amount of muscle that we had 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 before, it will improve our appearance and 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.190
 will improve our physical condition 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.680
 our state of health 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.000
 then run from run to lower 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.070
 weight is good idea 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.020
 better do not do it if you're not going to do it 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.850
 ok and you have to take these four 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.620
 points in mind to do it well and still 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.160
 doing it well there is a high 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.800
 probability that it does not go well for you 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.450
 are things then I want to see your 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.240
 comments below if someone has 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.100
 had success in quotes running 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.690
 because there may be some success is what 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.270
 only thing you're going through is the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.620
 body weight you can lose weight but 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.540
 that does not necessarily mean that 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.970
 You are lowering fat the dog and I 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.330
 is doing ham because the dog 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.669
 he runs and as he is running he is 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.880
 angry with what I'm saying what 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.870
 I feel friend 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.699
 this is I want to see your comments 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.610
 about who has benefited from 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.020
 run and why do you think this and who has 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.090
 stopped running because he discovered that he did not 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.050
 It was his thing but friends I'm talking 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.050
 exclusively 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.660
 the point of losing weight and not the 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.090
 health effects that the 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.710
 made to run well friends then they 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.710
 I'm talking very soon bye
