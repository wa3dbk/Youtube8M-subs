00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello everyone, and where are your friends with you and Fox? 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.200
 today we are looking at 3 and james mod 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.130
 This mod we add to the game two new 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.470
 stone it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 rubies and sapphires and also allow us 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 crafting of these tools and let 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 emerald tool paints which 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.710
 we had the game but only as 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.970
 payment itself as well as this mod 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 will add a triple stone which 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 obtained from these three stones if their 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.680
 put it all together which means from 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.550
 he can also be in front of the tools and he 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 very effective 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 what can be said started by 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 efficiency all these stones are the same 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 absolutely identical no weaker than diamonds 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 but in metal level prints but by 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.530
 strength they are all different means the most 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.600
 their strength is actually emerald he 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 even stronger than a diamond and enough of it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 much more time in second place 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 we have 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 sapphire and on the third rubens but if we 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.659
 all put them together it turns out 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.420
 triple stone which is both in strength and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 As much as two times better than efficiency 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 diamond meaning it is very cool and worth 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 to do it because with such picks 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.860
 swords there and shovels 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 you can do much more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.409
 Action to do it much faster than 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 diamonds let's look at triple 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.580
 stone with a brief of it anything i 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 I think you should not show how to craft 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.350
 out of the ordinary of these stones because in this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.930
 absolutely nothing complicated this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 simple craft ordinary tools like 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.770
 you do it with wood stones there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 iron don't know diamonds 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 all recipes are exactly the same simple 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.640
 let's look now at triple c 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.429
 we only need for this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.770
 three pebbles here such I will make it 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.229
 start one show and then later on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 let's make the tools just 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.479
 take one gemstone 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.750
 come and do the following here 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.840
 we put sapphire here we put 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.209
 emerald and here we put the diamond and oh my gosh 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.819
 we get a triple to meter stone 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.410
 this is a wonderful kamik from which we 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.349
 we can already make our tool and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.079
 now let 's get on the cheek and two 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.569
 precious Komi so that we will have three 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.269
 triple stones and we can make a hole 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.150
 I'll show you how it works just 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.519
 wonderful mod and which adds 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.019
 krypton cheat he is no special 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.810
 add benefits because find 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.569
 all these stones are quite difficult but not 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.879
 however nevertheless very cool mod 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.379
 which will ease your game here we are 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.060
 got three three centuries doing me a pickaxe 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.209
 ordinary rector that is and pickaxe ready 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.900
 see how it drips see opa opa 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.280
 everything is gone to me here for example i'm for 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
 comparisons are able to cry like this 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.639
 diamond pickaxe will drip see here 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.430
 we have a diamond, but such a diamond 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.910
 and here it is diamond and here 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.430
 triple 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.650
 I think everything can be seen with the naked eye 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.840
 you see for yourself that the correct stone is 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.650
 cool well can do the tools 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 also 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.299
 and from here all these stones 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.079
 said no worse than a diamond dripping but 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.780
 about part 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.389
 more emerald on this all this mod 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.889
 nothing else adds but that 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.780
 again quite enough for that 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.819
 to enjoy the game 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.590
 Insert mode is for fun and 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.849
 not like some just worth mods for 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.370
 order to put fashion 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.239
