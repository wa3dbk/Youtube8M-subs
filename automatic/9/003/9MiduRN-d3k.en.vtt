00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.050 
and I will post my results I imagine
that<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:09.420> may<00:04:09.690> fit<00:04:10.020> with<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.560> bit<00:04:10.739> of

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
that it may fit with a little bit of

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.410 
that it may fit with a little bit of
force<00:04:12.590> but<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.700> quite<00:04:15.000> snug

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
force but it is going to be quite snug

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.220 
force but it is going to be quite snug
but<00:04:15.720> anyhow<00:04:16.049> there<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.040> go
