00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.320
 [music] 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.190
 Hi there, this is a special edition from 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.310
 auruma 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.099
 damn it happened then what was said 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.789
 quite a long time since the release of new 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.189
 the face since the players already 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.189
 about two months ago jumped 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.309
 the bar 4 900 cups everyone talked about it 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.000
 when will there be a player with five thousand 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.670
 cups 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.980
 developers rushed and introduced a new 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.079
 legendary league and this dude in 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.110
 actually found it today 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.720
 that is, today here at 9 o'clock 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.730
 evenings and mask 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.760
 2100 player under the name Shannen wyatt i'm so 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.360
 I understand he was in the Arab clan 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.820
 champions yeah i mean ora champ ora would 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.860
 champions here us for some reason he 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 now is without a plan we have long 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.630
 seen in the top and he is the first player who 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.750
 got five thousand cups and actually 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.920
 became a flash legend both in direct and in 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.780
 figuratively 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.119
 besides he got his 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 legendary league then equestrian first 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.179
 the man who reached five 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.979
 thousand naturally he will go down in history 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:27.100
 previous dude who got first 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.819
 4000 cups it was over a year ago 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.289
 even maybe more than a year and a half ago he 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.929
 really became a legend 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.359
 If you search about him infu very much 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.179
 old articles but unfortunately probably 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.999
 no longer playing and so what is this 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.039
 man really like i said 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:47.859
 we saw in the top of his already very, very 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.109
 for a long time he hung that first second third 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.719
 place that is constantly 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.419
 Chasing race with other dudes 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:59.499
 and it is worth noting that we still have 

00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:02.109
 getting ready on the way at least 1 2 3 4 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.240
 legends that will but alas they already 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.300
 there will be no 1 that is, it will be all 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 absolutely not 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.030
 see full 10 quietly man plays 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.640
 long enough salt judging by the selected 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.420
 an obstacle that is basically not 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 rashid 148 well and of course 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.370
 It is worth noting that at such high 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.750
 goblets infusion means just huge 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.210
 and therefore in no way infusion 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.580
 money in the game can not be obtained at this 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.140
 moment of 5000 cups is just 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 unreal well really but i don't know yes no 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.470
 you know probably unreal here i 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.930
 communicated with one of the crowd out claims 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.000
 that everyone at such high cups spend 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.730
 well there i don't know two hundred three hundred bucks for 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560
 Season on this here in order of things I not 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.470
 I know, if I'm shocking you, this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.180
 information yes that's exactly because 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.320
 4,500 plus 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 Well, that's 4 500+ cups, this is absolute 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.780
 Well, as if the donators in the game but actually 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 Donata's philosophy of winning the same 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.910
 the very thing that I was also a man explained 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.280
 says for example a new movie came out you 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.920
 downloaded it 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
 somewhere there looked at the pirated version and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 said a and my principles I will not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.910
 pay not for the money that is here 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 about the same if you play 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.810
 the game if it starts for you if you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.480
 want to get some achievements 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.670
 please bless and no one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.940
 in principle, you can still show 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.560
 even without money the cool results in 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.900
 Well, I congratulate this man 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.470
 let's see what they do in general 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.890
 profile see what is here 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.239
 pay attention worth paying here 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.320
 attention to the number of town halls ie he 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.320
 4400 town hall destroyed the conqueror 7730 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.300
 five wins really well such 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.160
 average results that have happened 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.870
 however we saw more and more on 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.019
 It is worth noting that he is already in the champ 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.390
 more precisely, he was already a champion 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.150
 champions have been around for a very long time 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.360
 so there is no season there 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.900
 you know 500.000 uah so this does not happen 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.880
 It is worth noting that for this season season 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.989
 when did we start the season let's 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.270
 let's see the season with us and it ends 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.250
 that is, 1 day 10 hours left until 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:33.210
 the end of the season and at this stage he has 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.390
 eighty-seven wins and 7 asad 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.789
 won well, cool results for 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.550
 such high cup eighty seven 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.370
 wins, in principle, it’s okay to watch 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.380
 there are more to his rivals 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.090
 there is a sotochka but they all have everything in 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.460
 principle sotochka understand this well 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.910
 plus or minus yes that is that's nice but 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.630
 IS-7 Assad is also generally averaged. 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.729
 data that is, as if there were chances 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.919
 all I understand all that is like 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.610
 at least in the top 10 everyone had chances 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.190
 get this achievement first but 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.040
 fortanulo of course 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:14.370
 Shamin Shanin damn that I constantly 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.900
 problems with nicknames so something like that well 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.230
 and what else is in his profile 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.840
 I do n’t even know gold 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.180
 600 stolen 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.740
 600 million principle, no such straight 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.580
 super grand know 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:35.070
 some achievements shredder walls well 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.760
 as if here is the usual top player 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.650
 mediocre enough that is here 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.580
 oil is four times more than the norm 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.320
 heroic theft all stolen very 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.600
 cool yeah no they do n't have anything like that 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.510
 phenomenal therefore basically this and 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.200
 even very motivated but also by 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.450
 about the war hero these 190 stars as 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.610
 would probably when blood appeared he 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.950
 test it and then just scored 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.860
 so here too are the players who 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.280
 procurement prey on whom they simply 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.100
 clog so the game is divided into those who 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.150
 either the cup the emphasis on the cup whether side well 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.450
 That something like this 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.490
 so we have a legend flash and I have you 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.860
 I congratulate congratulations again this 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.720
 the player really is this 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.240
 really great 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.090
 first legend I thought what else would have 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.370
 wait a month can wait longer 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.320
 following legends and we will follow 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.600
 what will happen in the legendary league 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.990
 because there your rules there your 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.510
 tournament like village same season yes 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.370
 therefore also quite interesting as it is 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.919
 everything will work out but he has this value 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.410
 looks pretty good though many 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.169
 they say that purple 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.720
 resembles a crystal league and could 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.910
 developers take one of the colors of the rainbow 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.950
 only the other who did not meet in 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.780
 leagues before this then there is a lot of criticism by 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.610
 about this, but as for me 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.729
 that's exactly how he looks from him 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.010
 profiles are generally quite good so that somehow 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.810
 so with you was aurum put huskies 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.430
 subscribe to the channel write to 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.900
 comments how do you feel about what u 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.900
 We have a legend of flash and 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.009
