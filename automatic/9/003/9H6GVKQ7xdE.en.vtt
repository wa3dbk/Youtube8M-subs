00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 hello to all what to do 35 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.379
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 little video from the nash series of their 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.529
 is today actually I chose to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.029
 you simply present two 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.830
 the time of the ultimate catalog 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.939
 phishing so ceded them a little bit 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.980
 more upscale than theirs that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 I was able to present previously but 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 that's when they're relatively 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.360
 accessible anyway it's not either 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 theirs at 50 euros 40 euros 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.320
 it is actually for fishing so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.730
 destroyed in ultra light and especially in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 veins of very fast water this is at 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.190
 to say that it is from then on that they hold 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 very much the current i'm going to start 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 by introducing the small goal is goal 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.210
 makes cloud take race and then I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 will introduce you rice or who 45s 2 duo 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.710
 so we attack right away with the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.890
 small buffet doras of take cloud 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 then this time it will be 4 3 cm for 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 4.5 g so it's relatively light without 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 theirs actually that will sink quickly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 by the fact that it is very dense and it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.880
 will actually emit a relatively 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.880
 serious is relatively weak 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.619
 I hope you hear it all 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.049
 just what benefit it's going to have a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.150
 serious noise is low it will avoid 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.500
 scare fish fearful the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 opening day and at the same time it's going 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 so allow to have on time that the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 fish will be able to spot more 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150
 easily if the water is a little bit 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 tinted when others have loaded at 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 level of armament we he is armed 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.150
 in fact two black triples strong of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 to do and without a barb then it's the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.570
 tripe that are very pungent and the fact 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.950
 they are barbless it's a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.299
 big advantage when fishing no kill 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.820
 that is to say that we will be able to get 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.509
 the fish easily and it will avoid 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.189
 hurt him 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.320
 of course it will be necessary to leave a tension 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.970
 constant between the fish is your 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.579
 cane otherwise you risk in fact everything 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.070
 simply to get on a blow of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.549
 head at the level of the colors it is 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 available in ten colors 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.740
 relatively natural but you have 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.090
 also colors a little more 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.680
 flashy that can allow you to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.750
 to fish in the waters a little tinted 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 afterwards it's up to you to adapt so the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 color according to the type of fish 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.890
 you search according to the waters that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.450
 you fish for what is defined 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 so this is a lure that is very very 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
 well finished I really like 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.160
 this little fins that we find 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.520
 often actually on take lures 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.200
 cloud 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.959
 it gives a little more realism 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.300
 to theirs and to actually push this 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.490
 realism even further you have some 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.260
 very natural eyes and the fault retailer 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 water perceived operculum where yes 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.300
 it's the same thing almost 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.920
 scales actually are not visible 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.660
 we see them a little bit of sub we see 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.489
 that there are kinds of streaks actually 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.500
 on theirs but it does not come out 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.700
 Verry much 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.840
 on the other hand the painting really holds 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.330
 well it's a lure that has a duration of 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.800
 life which relatively large ie 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.910
 that even if you damage the hooks it 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.680
 you'll just have to change them 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.989
 the painting will maintain ie 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.730
 that neither fish nor hooks are going 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.930
 leave marks on the paint and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.850
 you will be able to watch this time 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.739
 long enough at the level of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.110
 use so I use them in 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.209
 simply to fish for 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.800
 holes in fast flowing water then 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.180
 I will explain it is in their 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.519
 fact that is very dense bond that goes 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 to sink quickly and at the same time 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.580
 a lure that holds the current very well 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.870
 so you will be able to use it by 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.430
 example for fishing for torrents or 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.860
 small rivers with water flows 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.510
 very important and when you go 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.799
 need to go down a little bit 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.660
 in the water layer to fetch 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.519
 the fish in a basin for example 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.650
 you can use this lure as they 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.140
 flow fast when you launch 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.720
 it will go down in the water layer is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.230
 simply in fact it goes no no 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.459
 more to get to the bottom 3 meters away 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.530
 it will get to the bottom faster 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.940
 because their classics often when we 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.860
 uses a flowing lure that flows 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.600
 relatively slowly it is thrown at 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.010
 where you want to fish is everything 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.690
 simply it will go down so much 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.579
 slowly in the layer of water that with 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.470
 the fast current theirs it will already be 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.180
 surrendered to perpetuity so no you go 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.920
 can really sin where we are and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.390
 dug a little bit more your peach 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.730
 good now we attack with the little 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.510
 rookie of duos so it's rice or who 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.700
 45 s is as its name indicates 4,5 cm 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.799
 and he's cool in s for thinking in 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.420
 English so it's 4 g which is getting 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.239
 intended in fact for fishing in ultra 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.680
 light again is actually it's 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.140
 a lure that will sink but more 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.269
 slowly that the little doha buffet 6 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.190
 so who will be less dense at the level 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.520
 of the noise it makes a noise a little bit 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.020
 more acute than the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.190
 make race so it will complement each other 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.259
 in fact it's gold going 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.310
 complete and a little more noise 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.310
 loud we hear a little better 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.900
 here I hope you get along 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.830
 well at the level of the armament 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.970
 I do not know if you saw it but in 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.250
 done I'm pricking myself up 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.259
 fingers everywhere without their younger ones 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.210
 Triple actually very very pricking 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.740
 hooks are relatively late may by 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.240
 against the spiciness and very very good so 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.310
 it's an advantage when you have trouble 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.530
 shoe these fish there trout actually 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.479
 the least shots that you 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.979
 give it when she has it in your mouth 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.380
 iron the rest what the hook goes 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.389
 to penetrate the flesh without problem 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.759
 penetrates both the fingers at the level 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.349
 colors then it is available in 8 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.280
 colors so it's all colors 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.080
 metallised 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.669
 so I call it laser colors 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.259
 in fact simply gave up colors that 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.710
 have a lot of reflections that are very 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.360
 brilliant so it metallic colors 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.250
 with different variants you have 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.080
 rather natural color like this one 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.819
 with small dots on a small 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.979
 little like a young trout and you have 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.599
 also completely different colors 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.259
 of style at the all- silver hour with 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.490
 some reflections on it and it's at 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.199
 level of finishes so this is a 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.520
 lure who is very very well finished me 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.139
 in fact I like a lot about this their 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.699
 the aggressive aspect that it has is to say 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.039
 that the eye is not a classic eye 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.599
 round you have a really good eye 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.759
 visible and well defined against it 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.380
 a little more elongated and indulges 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.029
 to lure a little bit more 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.490
 aggressive a little more modern me I 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.000
 find it nice you have the detail of 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.460
 the operation 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.620
 as on the small goal done is actually 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.210
 you have the scales here we see 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.770
 really well the fencing at the level of 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.779
 scales there are some brands that make 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.639
 that's nice enough it still gives 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.610
 more realism to lures it grows 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.340
 realism even further no 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.560
 little fins on that there painting 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.120
 it is of very good quality 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.039
 paint does not flake either between 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.500
 the fish that will actually see her 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.909
 mouth and hooks where the stones 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.259
 who could rub on theirs there is 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.699
 no problem the painting holds well 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.590
 it's a lure that has a lifespan 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.139
 which is relatively long still a 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.699
 times and at the level of use in 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.990
 done as you could see it's a 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.520
 lure who is all hungry but really 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.380
 all without however with a whole 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.240
 little bib at the end and so that their 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.370
 actually who is not going to have a lot 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.700
 of batch lot supports will be able to slide 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.560
 around the time 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.240
 without offering resistance too big 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.530
 and so theirs does not go off the hook 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.630
 when fishing in currents 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.340
 very fast that's a big advantage 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.040
 when you want to fish in fact 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.720
 daval upstream so when you want 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.580
 back up the current but who has 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.230
 a lot of water flow theirs in 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.240
 is not going to turn on itself 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.760
 unlike some their classic 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.020
 we will say I do not know I will not go 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.520
 name by name like that because I have 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.080
 not in the lead but here are some of them 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.180
 simply when fishing with a 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.770
 current too high or so with a 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.060
 recovery speed too fast the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.740
 their turns on itself or 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.060
 so theirs schism screen and be 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.040
 to the right or to the left he 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.570
 fatten more according to him it is expected 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.220
 really to fish in torrents 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.610
 in very fast currents and has no 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.650
 problem 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.060
 on top of that as it is cool years 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.190
 allows you to dig a little bit 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.870
 so of course it's not going to be easy to 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.150
 dig when you go upstream 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.530
 with this type of time on the other hand 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.510
 does if you fish down the 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.160
 current you can dig a little bit 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.830
 but it is still more intended for 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.630
 go up the courses here that's it 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.920
 that's it for these two little ones their game 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.540
 you do a nice little editing with 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.860
 lots of pictures for you 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.910
 see theirs in his details of 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.670
 different colors etc 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.180
 and then otherwise we end up for full 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.310
 other videos 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.310
 go ciao everyone has more
