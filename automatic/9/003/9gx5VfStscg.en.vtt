why<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.660> looked<00:00:18.840> at<00:00:18.990> voices<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.650> were<00:00:19.710> looking

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
why we looked at voices we were looking

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.759 
why we looked at voices we were looking
to<00:00:20.369> move<00:00:21.210> away<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.689> paper-pick<00:00:22.140> operation

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to move away from a paper-pick operation

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.550 
to move away from a paper-pick operation
and<00:00:23.039> voice<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.550> come<00:00:23.820> into<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> market

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
and voice it just come into the market

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.740 
and voice it just come into the market
very<00:00:25.560> new<00:00:25.769> technology<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.449> look<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
very new technology and so we look to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.290 
very new technology and so we look to
explore<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> same<00:00:28.650> time<00:00:29.179> one<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
explore that at the same time one of the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
explore that at the same time one of the
main<00:00:30.420> reasons<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.779> choosing<00:00:31.019> voice<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.710> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
main reasons for choosing voice is that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069 
main reasons for choosing voice is that
our<00:00:32.880> operation<00:00:33.390> didn't<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:33.809> fit<00:00:33.960> with

our operation didn't really fit with

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.130 
our operation didn't really fit with
barcodes<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> voice<00:00:36.030> seemed<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> sit<00:00:37.020> on

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
barcodes and voice seemed to sit on

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.670 
barcodes and voice seemed to sit on
because<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:37.790> unique<00:00:38.790> cut<00:00:39.329> number

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680

vital<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.190> us<00:02:07.310> we've<00:02:07.790> had<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.910> number<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.270> things

vital to us we've had a number of things
I<00:02:08.720> think<00:02:08.780> which<00:02:09.020> have<00:02:09.610> evolved<00:02:10.610> from<00:02:10.670> using

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
I think which have evolved from using

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880 
I think which have evolved from using
books<00:02:11.209> where<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.810> once<00:02:12.020> we've<00:02:12.230> set<00:02:12.560> up<00:02:12.590> box

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.560 
books where so once we've set up box

designed it is the real-time information
that<00:03:06.049> we're<00:03:06.170> getting

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that we're getting

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.130 
that we're getting
so<00:03:07.130> as<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> pic<00:03:07.610> ulis<00:03:07.850> picking<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.239> item<00:03:08.570> you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
so as the pic ulis picking the item you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.069 
so as the pic ulis picking the item you
know<00:03:09.230> WMS<00:03:09.829> is<00:03:10.010> updated<00:03:10.810> instantaneously<00:03:11.810> as

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
know WMS is updated instantaneously as

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.890 
know WMS is updated instantaneously as
his<00:03:12.230> person<00:03:12.620> says<00:03:12.829> it<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.910> reach<00:03:14.299> trucks<00:03:14.660> are

that's<00:03:17.810> updated<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> next<00:03:19.400> step<00:03:19.610> we<00:03:19.820> felt

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
that's updated so the next step we felt

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.840 
that's updated so the next step we felt
we<00:03:20.269> wanted<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.810> move<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.440> was<00:03:21.850> physical
