00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.120
 Hello welcome to my game of the month because 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.340
 I lost touching a boxing of something that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.980
 you had had for some time so here 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.230
 he has forgotten the first expansion 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.610
 of the saying now with its seal 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.740
 original comes in a box of these 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.990
 small size that we already knew about 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.189
 expansions of arkham or some expansion 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.650
 of blood bowl also came in this 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.019
 size and the truth is that the box has 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.999
 back a little gives the impression that not 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.260
 closes completely tells us the part of 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.150
 back that has a loja regulation of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.130
 primal good and in stopping what 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.250
 we cancel let's go let's remove the 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.250
 seal 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.109
 but we remove this medical plastic 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.449
 noise to my friend jarque that he likes 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.949
 these plastic noises and we're going to open 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.720
 the box of knowing forgotten now that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.580
 contains 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.990
 we open the little box of knowing 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:02.280
 forgotten and we met first 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.400
 Manuel and I is a simple paper where we 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 will explain imagine how this works 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.180
 expansion although in principle this 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.770
 expansion do not expect much more than a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.689
 new primal and letters 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.390
 speaking the king of Rome here we have the 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.950
 primigenio gig one of the classics of the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.750
 world of lovecraft the games of the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 graf at least here comes your card 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.859
 much that we do not want to spoil the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.810
 surprises from the back we have 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.310
 also a die-cut cardboard sheet 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 and only one that is presented 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 the seal if it does not resist much 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.480
 if it will not shine 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.070
 to look more outside 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.440
 Well yes it's just a fixed sheet 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.680
 we have four life counters two of 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.900
 sanity and we have a sectarian and seven 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.370
 epic monsters worth look normal 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.620
 well they have a fixed distinction there 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.320
 a couple of them do not have proof 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.260
 of sanity but they have 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.149
 see here is a test of perception 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.070
 eye is not usual he knew that the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.740
 rules will tell us about this what is the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.720
 single die-cut and low-load cardboard 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.650
 what they promised us to do 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.780
 this expression we have small letters 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.819
 we take a look we have new letters 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.099
 they look like artifacts 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.990
 other letters these are the objects 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.150
 normal we can buy 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.870
 and we have been good debt must be 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.650
 similar to those that we had nothing out of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.020
 the normal 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.380
 damn blessed is called stage 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.580
 poisoned the normal ones and we see one is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.130
 I missed this lost in the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.069
 time and space very very much of it 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.719
 grass 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.609
 and what more and then spells conditions and 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.030
 clairvoyance or some already known 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:02.639
 others we look new this in 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.730
 how many small letters is here 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.469
 and large letters a few two decks 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.500
 I think that here below there is no 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.719
 nothing else we're going to see these decks of 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.269
 large letters that for what we had 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.069
 promised are extensions of letters 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.829
 look here we have two letters for 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.629
 get to the person in the back 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.120
 84 numbers of primitives however 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.989
 here we have set one two three four 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.150
 five six seven eight more for 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.359
 primigenios we have that blue two more 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.129
 two more good these are these are the 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:46.430
 specials here we have those of track 1 2 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:48.769
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.180
 more to finish primal web this is 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.889
 what he needed eldridge horror from 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.840
 again we have here for all 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.030
 primigenios imagine that for there 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.260
 they will come more because we do not have letters 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.930
 previous 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.730
 yes here 16 for each of those of the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.900
 existing primitives 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.540
 let's open the other March where 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.310
 insists I imagine that in there grave 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.489
 few more there are those there we go to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:18.259
 count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 14 15 16 if you wear one two three four 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.820
 five six seven and eight perfect for 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.770
 that there are the same number of gig cards 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.980
 that of the rest of primigenios we have more 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.260
 portals letters 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.320
 the special letters of him and two more 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.850
 for here Zulu for your figure we have a 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.770
 all have two more for each 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.250
 new expedition letters 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.090
 generic encounters green encounters 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.280
 oranges planets peace and even good 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.620
 bitton cards many 66 more cards of 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.170
 myth that we have yellow and blue green 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.240
 our good colors as you see a 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.880
 bunch of letters that was something more than 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.610
 necessary 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.670
 Well, you have seen many many letters 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.530
 that we needed to expand a 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.390
 little between jet as to its part 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.250
 thematic the said error is not a game 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.310
 that has no replayability despite 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.960
 the few letters but it is exhausted 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.000
 quickly in the thematic part the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.590
 rather narrative part of what letters 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.870
 above all primal would be few like that 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.910
 that this expansion despite its high 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.920
 price is more than recommended if you 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.860
 like the tri jet one step before 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.780
 arkham one of our favorites then 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.100
 just have a boxing today we continue 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.100
 thanks for your time
