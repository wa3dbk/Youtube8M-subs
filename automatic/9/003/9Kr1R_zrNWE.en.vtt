00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
know I'm hoping it's looking bright but

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
know I'm hoping it's looking bright but
obviously<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> next-gen<00:00:43.649> consoles

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
obviously we got the next-gen consoles

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
obviously we got the next-gen consoles
and<00:00:44.460> even<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.850> you've<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> PC<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> like

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and even if you've got a PC but I like

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
and even if you've got a PC but I like
the<00:00:46.230> fact<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> we've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.219> next-gen

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the fact that we've got these next-gen

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.889 
the fact that we've got these next-gen
consoles<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.539> gonna<00:00:48.660> mean<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
consoles because it's gonna mean that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.869 
consoles because it's gonna mean that
the<00:00:49.230> PC<00:00:49.620> version<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.039> even<00:00:50.280> better<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.640> well

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the PC version is even better as well

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.270 
the PC version is even better as well
because<00:00:51.539> obviously<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.440> PC<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because obviously we know that the PC is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.450 
because obviously we know that the PC is
as<00:00:53.550> good<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> ps4<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> Xbox<00:00:55.739> one

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
as good as the ps4 and the Xbox one

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
as good as the ps4 and the Xbox one
depending<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.210> piece<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.600> you've<00:00:57.899> got

last couple of years because you know f1
2013<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.390> people<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.750> gonna

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
2013 I think a lot of people are gonna

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.800 
2013 I think a lot of people are gonna
agree<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.729> opinion<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.509> wasn't

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
agree with this in my opinion it wasn't

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
agree with this in my opinion it wasn't
the<00:01:52.020> best<00:01:52.170> Codemasters<00:01:52.890> game<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.759> opinion

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the best Codemasters game in my opinion

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.819 
the best Codemasters game in my opinion
2012<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.070> 2010<00:01:56.070> will<00:01:56.310> my<00:01:56.399> favorite<00:01:56.880> too<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
2012 and 2010 will my favorite too and

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.020 
2012 and 2010 will my favorite too and
you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.670> personal<00:02:00.000> opinion

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you know that's just personal opinion

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.539 
you know that's just personal opinion
though<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> might<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.869> f1<00:02:01.110> 2013<00:02:01.439> war<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.100> in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
though you might like f1 2013 war but in

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
though you might like f1 2013 war but in
my<00:02:02.939> opinion<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.390> took<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.930> bit<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.259> step

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
my opinion they took a bit of a step

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.170 
my opinion they took a bit of a step
backwards<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.130> f1<00:02:05.399> 2013

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
backwards in f1 2013

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.570 
backwards in f1 2013
yeah<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:06.780> did<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> classic<00:02:08.310> cars

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
yeah they did put in the classic cars

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and stuff but it just I don't think it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
and stuff but it just I don't think it

think they really are trying to focus on
f1<00:02:29.160> 2014<00:02:29.849> now<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.300> I've<00:02:31.200> been<00:02:31.319> unfortunate

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
f1 2014 now so I've been unfortunate

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
f1 2014 now so I've been unfortunate
Frost<00:02:32.190> guys<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:32.970> wanting<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.480> play<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
2013 was a little bit of a letdown it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.479

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
when you look back at it the classic

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.040 
when you look back at it the classic
cars<00:02:43.430> nobody<00:02:44.430> plays<00:02:44.670> them<00:02:44.910> nowadays<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.569> mean

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
first the game first launched but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.809 
first the game first launched but
overall<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.620> G<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.370> it

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
was alright to have them in the game but

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.160 
was alright to have them in the game but
in<00:02:56.640> my<00:02:56.850> opinion<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.080> this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170

2010<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:11.130> finally<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.940> yet<00:03:12.180> we'll

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
2010 and they finally is like yet we'll

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.539 
2010 and they finally is like yet we'll
do<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.590> didn't<00:03:13.860> exactly<00:03:14.100> go<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> plan

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
do that and it didn't exactly go to plan

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.250 
do that and it didn't exactly go to plan
I<00:03:14.970> mean<00:03:15.299> they<00:03:15.360> did<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.750> good<00:03:15.870> job<00:03:16.049> with

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
I mean they did a really good job with

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.750 
I mean they did a really good job with
the<00:03:16.470> classic<00:03:16.830> cars<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.400> they<00:03:17.640> were

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the classic cars I think they were

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.410 
the classic cars I think they were
really<00:03:18.329> fun<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:20.130> opinion<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.209> didn't

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
really fun but my opinion I just didn't

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.729 
really fun but my opinion I just didn't
enjoy<00:03:21.630> them<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:21.930> much<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.290> driving<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
enjoy them as much as driving the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.940 
enjoy them as much as driving the
modern-day<00:03:23.100> cars<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.450> know<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.739> that's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
modern-day cars so you know that that's

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.410 
modern-day cars so you know that that's
just<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.250> thing<00:03:26.459> sometimes<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:27.209> just

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
just a thing sometimes you don't just

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.940 
just a thing sometimes you don't just
enjoy<00:03:27.570> things<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.140> implement<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:28.829> they

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
enjoy things that implement it but they

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.270 
enjoy things that implement it but they
did<00:03:29.160> test<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.609> waters<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> good<00:03:32.190> on

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
did test the waters so you know good on

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.400 
did test the waters so you know good on
them<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.640> doing<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.239> opinion<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
them for doing it in my opinion but and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.140 
them for doing it in my opinion but and
I<00:03:34.590> think<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.220> future<00:03:35.579> games<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.060> you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
I think it's think future games that you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.210 
I think it's think future games that you
probably<00:03:36.450> don't<00:03:36.780> want<00:03:36.989> classic<00:03:37.260> cars<00:03:37.620> maybe

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
probably don't want classic cars maybe

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.120 
probably don't want classic cars maybe
like<00:03:38.519> one<00:03:38.760> or<00:03:38.910> two<00:03:39.560> maybe<00:03:40.560> show<00:03:40.739> more

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
like one or two maybe show more

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.650 
like one or two maybe show more
modern-day<00:03:41.519> classic<00:03:41.850> cars<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.450> makes

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
modern-day classic cars and that makes

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.620 
modern-day classic cars and that makes
any<00:03:42.840> sense<00:03:42.870> maybe<00:03:43.320> some<00:03:43.680> sort<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.340> early<00:03:45.030> 2000

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
any sense maybe some sort of early 2000

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.300 
any sense maybe some sort of early 2000
and<00:03:45.750> cars<00:03:45.930> I'd<00:03:46.200> really<00:03:46.560> enjoy<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.950> see<00:03:47.100> those

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and cars I'd really enjoy to see those

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.599 
and cars I'd really enjoy to see those
in<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> game<00:03:47.730> or<00:03:48.420> maybe<00:03:48.600> like<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.859> 2006<00:03:49.859> Renault

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
in the game or maybe like a 2006 Renault

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.000 
in the game or maybe like a 2006 Renault
or<00:03:50.640> something<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.299> don't<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.109> you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
or something I don't really know but you

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.110 
or something I don't really know but you

what classic cars you would like to see
in<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.829> game<00:03:56.010> does<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.819> quite<00:03:57.000> an

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
in the game does that be quite an

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.090 
in the game does that be quite an
interesting<00:03:57.299> talking<00:03:57.720> point<00:03:58.140> but<00:03:58.440> in<00:03:58.799> my

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
interesting talking point but in my

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.009 
interesting talking point but in my
opinion<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.670> future<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.120> woman<00:04:00.390> 1<00:04:00.569> games<00:04:00.780> is

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
opinion the future of woman 1 games is

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.170 
opinion the future of woman 1 games is
looking<00:04:01.410> quite<00:04:01.590> bright<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.459> next<00:04:02.760> generation

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
looking quite bright the next generation

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.449 
looking quite bright the next generation
of<00:04:03.239> consoles<00:04:03.720> should<00:04:03.989> enable<00:04:04.440> them<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.040> have

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
of consoles should enable them to have

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.000 
of consoles should enable them to have
even<00:04:05.819> more<00:04:06.090> power<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:07.890> always

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
even more power and you know we always

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.410 
even more power and you know we always
know<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.250> codemasters<00:04:08.940> games<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.269> got

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
know that codemasters games have got

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.990 
know that codemasters games have got
absolutely<00:04:09.660> amazing<00:04:10.590> graphics<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.310> I'm

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
absolutely amazing graphics and I'm

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640 
absolutely amazing graphics and I'm
hoping<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.720> step<00:04:12.930> up<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.260> next<00:04:13.410> gen

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
hoping that the step up to next gen

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.440 
hoping that the step up to next gen
consoles<00:04:14.069> is<00:04:14.220> gonna<00:04:14.430> mean<00:04:14.639> that<00:04:15.150> they<00:04:15.239> can

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
consoles is gonna mean that they can

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.390 
consoles is gonna mean that they can
improve<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.019> physics<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.620> damaged<00:04:16.979> engine

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
improve the physics the damaged engine

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.490 
improve the physics the damaged engine
and<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.000> sort<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.299> stuff<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.750> obviously

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
and all that sort of stuff but obviously

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.420 
and all that sort of stuff but obviously
we<00:04:19.680> haven't<00:04:19.799> really<00:04:20.039> got<00:04:20.130> any<00:04:20.280> information

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
we haven't really got any information

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.640 
we haven't really got any information
about<00:04:20.850> f1<00:04:21.060> 2014<00:04:21.539> yet<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.080> can't<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:22.440> say

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
about f1 2014 yet so I can't really say

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.149 
about f1 2014 yet so I can't really say
anything<00:04:22.979> but<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.849> my<00:04:24.300> opinion<00:04:24.530> as<00:04:25.530> ed<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.039> is

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
anything but in my opinion as ed this is

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.379 
anything but in my opinion as ed this is
all<00:04:26.280> my<00:04:26.460> opinion

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
all my opinion

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.529 
all my opinion
that<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.680> acceleration<00:04:29.129> consoles<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.270> really

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
that the acceleration consoles is really

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.330 
that the acceleration consoles is really
going<00:04:30.689> to<00:04:30.749> help<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.199> future<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.889> Formula<00:04:32.219> one

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
going to help the future of Formula one

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.450 
going to help the future of Formula one
games<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.849> I'm<00:04:33.840> hoping<00:04:34.199> Codemasters<00:04:34.889> can

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
games and I'm hoping Codemasters can

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.839 
games and I'm hoping Codemasters can
really<00:04:36.060> improve<00:04:36.509> this<00:04:36.840> official<00:04:37.529> f1<00:04:37.680> 2014<00:04:38.430> if

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
really improve this official f1 2014 if

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.999 
really improve this official f1 2014 if
you<00:04:38.879> will<00:04:39.090> when<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.199> comes<00:04:40.409> out<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.860> think

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
you will when it comes out and I think

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.909 
you will when it comes out and I think
like<00:04:41.129> six<00:04:41.490> seven<00:04:42.120> months<00:04:42.569> I<00:04:42.779> look<00:04:43.169> exactly<00:04:43.590> too

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
like six seven months I look exactly too

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.860 
like six seven months I look exactly too
sure<00:04:44.159> but<00:04:44.699> I'm<00:04:44.849> hoping<00:04:45.389> it's<00:04:45.569> going<00:04:45.659> to<00:04:45.749> be<00:04:45.840> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
sure but I'm hoping it's going to be a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.679 
sure but I'm hoping it's going to be a
