quick note on the view a lot of people
are<00:01:48.149> complaining<00:01:48.509> about<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> obviously

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
are complaining about this is obviously

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.100 
are complaining about this is obviously
something<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.759> used<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
something you have to get used to but it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.319 
something you have to get used to but it
is<00:01:52.259> restrictive<00:01:52.950> football<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> restrictive

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
is restrictive football is restrictive

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
is restrictive football is restrictive
so<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> something<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.409> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.890> cope

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so it's something we need to just cope

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
so it's something we need to just cope
with<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> terms<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> gameplay<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
with in terms of the gameplay to me it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.260 
with in terms of the gameplay to me it
adds<00:01:58.110> an<00:01:58.350> element<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.369> adds<00:01:59.549> difficulty

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
adds an element to it it adds difficulty

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
adds an element to it it adds difficulty
yes<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.780> adds<00:02:00.930> frustration<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.799> times<00:02:02.189> but

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
yes it adds frustration at times but

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
yes it adds frustration at times but
overall<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
overall I think it's a very good way to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.830 
overall I think it's a very good way to
play<00:02:04.979> football<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.729> both<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> offense<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
play football on both the offense and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.459 
play football on both the offense and
defense

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469

actual<00:03:31.500> backwards<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.310> five<00:03:33.500> another<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:34.800> to

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
actual backwards one five another one to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.980 
actual backwards one five another one to
maintain<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.400> block<00:03:35.700> would<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:35.940> six<00:03:36.360> then<00:03:36.750> back

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
maintain a block would be six then back

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.810 
maintain a block would be six then back
to<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> lane<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:37.950> be<00:03:38.070> seven<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.650> then

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
to the lane would be seven and then

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.310 
to the lane would be seven and then
that's<00:03:41.820> really<00:03:41.970> not<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.390> Juke<00:03:42.690> as<00:03:42.900> much<00:03:43.080> as<00:03:43.200> it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
