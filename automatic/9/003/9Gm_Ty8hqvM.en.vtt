we're<00:01:25.870> not<00:01:25.960> actually<00:01:26.140> going<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.740> here<00:01:27.130> with<00:01:27.310> GC

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we're not actually going to here with GC

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.020 
we're not actually going to here with GC
extracting<00:01:29.080> out<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.410> water<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:30.370> trapped<00:01:30.790> in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
extracting out the water is trapped in

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.330 
extracting out the water is trapped in
the<00:01:31.120> way

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the way

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.779 
the way
so<00:01:33.420> what's<00:01:34.420> happening<00:01:34.719> is<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.520> protease<00:01:36.520> is

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
so what's happening is the protease is

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.090 
so what's happening is the protease is
going<00:01:37.179> down<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> machine<00:01:38.469> is<00:01:38.619> extracting

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
going down and the machine is extracting

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.209 
going down and the machine is extracting
some<00:01:39.399> example<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.909> put<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.329> whole<00:01:41.009> feminist<00:01:42.009> in

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
some example I put the whole feminist in

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.850 
some example I put the whole feminist in
Iran<00:01:42.429> but<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.000> was<00:01:43.119> really<00:01:43.420> badly

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
Iran but it was really badly

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.560 
Iran but it was really badly
we<00:01:44.950> can<00:01:45.130> do<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.880> look<00:01:46.090> like<00:01:46.210> an<00:01:46.360> old

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
we can do that and look like an old

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.270 
we can do that and look like an old
lemonade<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.930> lemon<00:01:50.290> juice<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> water

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
lemonade which the lemon juice the water

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:05.250 
lemonade which the lemon juice the water

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
see and now it's going to pour a bunch

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250 
see and now it's going to pour a bunch
into<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.880> glass<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
into the glass so you can see that the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.220 
into the glass so you can see that the
texture<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:17.890> worried<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:19.090> water<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
texture is very worried it is water so

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.280 
texture is very worried it is water so
you're<00:02:20.860> able<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.900> 75%<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
you're able to get 75% of all the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.900 
you're able to get 75% of all the
nutritionals<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.130> plate<00:02:24.430> we've

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
nutritionals on that plate we've

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.990 
nutritionals on that plate we've
extracted<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.780> via<00:02:26.560> juicing<00:02:27.070> it's<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:27.880> as

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
extracted out via juicing it's not as

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.070 
extracted out via juicing it's not as
blue<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.239> your<00:02:28.390> stomach<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:28.959> like

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.020 
having all of it but it's like 75% all
right<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.870> let's<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> taste<00:02:32.470> test<00:02:32.910> here<00:02:33.910> we

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
right so let's do the taste test here we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.850 
right so let's do the taste test here we
go<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.330> pour<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> little<00:02:34.900> bit<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.320> there<00:02:35.530> for

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
go that's pour a little bit in there for

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.140 
go that's pour a little bit in there for
you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.740 

it's<00:02:40.150> definitely<00:02:40.390> drinkable<00:02:42.270> would<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.300> would

I<00:03:19.060> start<00:03:19.570> my<00:03:19.750> days<00:03:19.959> with<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> green<00:03:20.680> smoothie<00:03:20.980> so

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
I start my days with a green smoothie so

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.740 
I start my days with a green smoothie so
I<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.560> blender<00:03:23.560> instead<00:03:23.970> what<00:03:24.970> do

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
I do it in the blender instead what do

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.580 
I do it in the blender instead what do
you<00:03:25.810> smoothie<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.769> well<00:03:27.040> all<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> know<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.000> do

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you smoothie is well all you I know I do

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.960 
you smoothie is well all you I know I do
but<00:03:29.590> there<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> difference<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.549> each<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:30.910> of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
but there is a difference to each one of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.050 
but there is a difference to each one of
them<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.600> we<00:03:32.019> blended<00:03:32.560> all<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.310> there<00:03:33.580> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
them if we blended all that up there you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.880 
them if we blended all that up there you
would<00:03:34.239> need<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.540> add<00:03:34.690> water<00:03:35.019> into<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.620> or

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
would need to add water into that or

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.979 
would need to add water into that or
some<00:03:36.100> kind<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.610> fluid<00:03:36.970> base<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.840> you're

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
some kind of a fluid base so you're

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.949 
some kind of a fluid base so you're
going<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.360> concentration<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.480> nutrients

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
going to the concentration of nutrients

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.039 
going to the concentration of nutrients
just<00:03:41.170> by<00:03:41.320> adding<00:03:41.560> writing<00:03:42.010> also<00:03:42.930> blending<00:03:43.930> up

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
just by adding writing also blending up

I<00:03:55.530> didn't<00:03:56.040> realize<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.610> much<00:03:56.760> was<00:03:57.150> left<00:03:57.390> but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
I didn't realize so much was left but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.080 
I didn't realize so much was left but
well<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.400> for

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
well this is you know this is the for

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.890 
well this is you know this is the for
example<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.630> outside<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.790> our<00:04:02.790> Apple<00:04:03.330> so

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
example the outside of our Apple so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
example the outside of our Apple so
that's<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.350> structure<00:04:04.710> that<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.580> Apple<00:04:06.030> came

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that's the structure that the Apple came

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.180 
that's the structure that the Apple came
in<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.260> what<00:04:07.410> we've<00:04:07.560> done<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.010> we've

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
in and what we've done is we've

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.380 
in and what we've done is we've
attracted<00:04:08.460> at<00:04:08.790> 75%<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.620> nutrient<00:04:11.190> value

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
attracted at 75% of the nutrient value

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.039 
attracted at 75% of the nutrient value
