00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.080
 good afternoon in this opportunity 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.789
 I want to teach you how Inertia 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.669
 the salt this is 'the marina' can 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.430
 find as coarse salt or sea salt 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.950
 does not have any additives or johnny 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.650
 without anything like that and this is a cube 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 of 12 liters what we are going to do with 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:29.140
 this spoon sopera great 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.800
 we will add this amount one 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 OK 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.470
 as I have an aquarium here with a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 water resting already of 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.589
 24 hours a half 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.530
 from calm water and the other half water 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.530
 tap 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 we will start 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.969
 to throw him 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.310
 that's how the salt is dissolving 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 but when we give him a blanket for 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.240
 that salt is well dissolved 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.020
 and once we do not have to be fine 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.020
 dissolved the salt we will exhibit 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.370
 more or less out there that are 12 liters 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 OK 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 but nothing being a bit annoyed 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 back and not good I can not do the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 work 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.750
 this goes well it's that we're going to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.760
 put the water 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.760
 right now 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.960
 It is already as you can see 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.510
 there is the height to then take with 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.870
 a slightly thicker fat hose than 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.769
 the normal ones that we use to aerate and 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.769
 we miss it 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.400
 here 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.050
 and that's all, but we'll do what 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.100
 he 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.580
 finish filling 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 she has in the water changed I have them 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.680
 made the salt every 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.859
 two or three water changes worth 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.709
 then I made a change of salt and 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.290
 then I come back with three more water 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.950
 normal so it helps prevent everything 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.600
 kind of infections and good as can 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.990
 see no 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.160
 do not affect the minimums a good 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.160
 greeting and until the next video
