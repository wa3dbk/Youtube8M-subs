00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
on the other side of the toilet again

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.149 
on the other side of the toilet again
this<00:04:57.659> is<00:04:57.780> probably<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.139> worst<00:04:58.349> night<00:04:58.590> ever<00:04:58.860> for

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
this is probably a worst night ever for

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.369 
this is probably a worst night ever for
a<00:04:59.270> hotel<00:05:00.270> they<00:05:00.389> have<00:05:00.539> to<00:05:00.659> deal<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:00.870> someone

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
a hotel they have to deal with someone

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.170 
a hotel they have to deal with someone
with<00:05:01.949> a<00:05:02.039> UV<00:05:02.370> lineup<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.909> they're<00:05:03.030> not

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
with a UV lineup that they're not

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.939 
with a UV lineup that they're not
expecting<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.720> yeah<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:04.650> just<00:05:04.740> basically

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
expecting that yeah so just basically

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.189 
expecting that yeah so just basically
all<00:05:05.310> around<00:05:05.460> there<00:05:05.789> so<00:05:06.389> what<00:05:06.780> I'm<00:05:06.840> gonna<00:05:06.960> do<00:05:07.080> is

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
all around there so what I'm gonna do is

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.570 
all around there so what I'm gonna do is
get<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.349> little<00:05:07.560> bleach<00:05:07.740> wipe<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.129> show<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.310> how

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
get a little bleach wipe to show you how

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.600 
get a little bleach wipe to show you how
that<00:05:08.970> could<00:05:09.090> be<00:05:09.150> resolved<00:05:09.569> very<00:05:09.750> easily<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:11.520> if

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
that could be resolved very easily so if

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.980 
that could be resolved very easily so if
that<00:05:11.729> kind<00:05:11.849> of<00:05:11.940> stuff<00:05:12.150> bothers<00:05:12.569> you<00:05:12.750> I

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that kind of stuff bothers you I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.149 
that kind of stuff bothers you I
recommend<00:05:13.379> going<00:05:13.590> with<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.919> Clorox

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
recommend going with the Clorox

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.580 
recommend going with the Clorox
disinfecting<00:05:14.460> wipes<00:05:15.180> on<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.110> go<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.560> can

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
disinfecting wipes on the go so you can

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.689 
disinfecting wipes on the go so you can
bring<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.860> way<00:05:16.979> into<00:05:17.159> traveling<00:05:17.610> or

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
bring this way into traveling or

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.790 
bring this way into traveling or
anything<00:05:17.879> like<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.080> would<00:05:19.199> remove<00:05:19.470> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
anything like that and it would remove a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.809 
anything like that and it would remove a
lot<00:05:19.979> of<00:05:20.069> those<00:05:20.190> things<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.460> we're<00:05:20.610> seeing

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819

and do this at the same time he's got a
little<00:05:43.639> wipe<00:05:43.819> here

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.240 

and<00:05:50.930> as<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.170> see<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.500> just<00:05:51.680> wipes<00:05:51.830> off<00:05:52.040> with

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
and as you see that just wipes off with

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.820 
and as you see that just wipes off with
just<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.460> little<00:05:52.640> bit<00:05:52.760> of<00:05:52.820> bleach<00:05:53.590> so<00:05:54.590> it<00:05:54.680> looks

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
just a little bit of bleach so it looks

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.800 
just a little bit of bleach so it looks
like<00:05:54.890> probably<00:05:55.280> uh<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:56.330> know<00:05:56.420> in<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.630> near

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
like probably uh you know in the near

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.300 
like probably uh you know in the near
future<00:05:57.020> this<00:05:57.320> photo<00:05:57.710> should<00:05:57.860> probably<00:05:58.070> do<00:05:58.280> a

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
future this photo should probably do a

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.760 
future this photo should probably do a
little<00:05:58.630> cleaning<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.990> ceiling<00:06:00.440> like<00:06:00.590> that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
little cleaning of the ceiling like that

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.190 
little cleaning of the ceiling like that
with<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.100> bleach<00:06:01.280> rag<00:06:01.750> just<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.840> get<00:06:02.960> rid<00:06:03.140> of

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
with the bleach rag just to get rid of

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.750 
with the bleach rag just to get rid of
all<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.740> kind<00:06:03.920> of<00:06:03.950> thing<00:06:04.130> from<00:06:04.340> showing<00:06:04.550> up

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
all that kind of thing from showing up

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.200 
all that kind of thing from showing up
under<00:06:05.600> UV<00:06:05.960> light<00:06:06.610> so<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.730> looks<00:06:07.880> like<00:06:08.000> what's

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
under UV light so it looks like what's

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.460 
under UV light so it looks like what's
happening<00:06:08.570> here<00:06:08.630> is<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.170> know<00:06:09.260> when<00:06:09.380> the

they're doing you know the basic area is
the<00:06:13.040> top<00:06:13.280> there<00:06:13.640> to<00:06:13.760> clean<00:06:14.000> off<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.270> counter

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.020 
the top there to clean off the counter
areas<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.830> maybe<00:06:15.950> the<00:06:16.100> size<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.700> switching

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030

off the the towels are doing just kind
of<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.370> overall<00:06:19.760> surface<00:06:20.060> stuff<00:06:20.450> it's<00:06:20.660> these

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
of the overall surface stuff it's these

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.690 
of the overall surface stuff it's these
microscopic<00:06:21.440> stuff<00:06:21.950> that<00:06:22.100> you're<00:06:22.220> seeing<00:06:22.430> in

microscopic stuff that you're seeing in

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.000 
microscopic stuff that you're seeing in
the<00:06:23.090> cracks<00:06:23.450> especially<00:06:23.690> of<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.770> rooms

the cracks especially of the rooms

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.760 
the cracks especially of the rooms
towards<00:06:25.850> behind<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.300> toilet<00:06:26.540> and<00:06:26.990> maybe<00:06:27.440> open

towards behind the toilet and maybe open

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.710 
towards behind the toilet and maybe open
the<00:06:27.830> ceiling<00:06:28.190> which<00:06:28.310> are<00:06:28.490> look<00:06:29.360> like<00:06:29.510> that<00:06:29.630> are

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
the ceiling which are look like that are

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.480 
the ceiling which are look like that are
being<00:06:29.930> missed

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
being missed

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.590 
being missed
perhaps<00:06:31.490> because<00:06:31.700> there's<00:06:31.940> no<00:06:32.090> UV<00:06:32.420> light

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
perhaps because there's no UV light

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.410 
perhaps because there's no UV light
under<00:06:33.560> in<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.740> cleaning<00:06:33.980> process<00:06:34.550> and<00:06:34.760> with<00:06:35.390> a

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
under in the cleaning process and with a

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.180 
under in the cleaning process and with a
lot<00:06:35.810> of<00:06:35.840> turnover<00:06:36.380> happening<00:06:36.800> in<00:06:36.920> Las<00:06:37.040> Vegas

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
lot of turnover happening in Las Vegas

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.160 
lot of turnover happening in Las Vegas
I'd<00:06:37.910> imagine<00:06:38.540> that<00:06:38.570> that<00:06:38.840> would<00:06:38.900> be<00:06:39.050> it's

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
I'd imagine that that would be it's

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.980 
I'd imagine that that would be it's
expected<00:06:39.890> on<00:06:40.190> that<00:06:40.730> someone<00:06:41.180> did<00:06:41.420> but<00:06:41.750> so<00:06:41.960> I

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
expected on that someone did but so I

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.750 
expected on that someone did but so I
expect<00:06:42.680> there<00:06:42.860> not<00:06:43.070> to<00:06:43.160> be<00:06:43.280> all<00:06:43.430> that<00:06:43.580> kind<00:06:43.730> of

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
expect there not to be all that kind of

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.280 
expect there not to be all that kind of
stuff<00:06:43.850> happening<00:06:44.300> on<00:06:44.450> the<00:06:44.810> main<00:06:45.020> surface

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
stuff happening on the main surface

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.700 
stuff happening on the main surface
areas<00:06:46.190> of<00:06:46.550> places<00:06:47.300> like<00:06:47.330> the<00:06:47.540> bathroom<00:06:47.710> but

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
areas of places like the bathroom but

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.080 
areas of places like the bathroom but
maybe<00:06:48.920> if<00:06:49.100> it's<00:06:49.280> happening<00:06:49.640> in<00:06:49.730> the<00:06:49.820> cracks

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
maybe if it's happening in the cracks

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.330 
maybe if it's happening in the cracks
that<00:06:50.480> you<00:06:50.870> know<00:06:50.990> just<00:06:51.620> some<00:06:51.770> of<00:06:51.890> the<00:06:51.980> fine
