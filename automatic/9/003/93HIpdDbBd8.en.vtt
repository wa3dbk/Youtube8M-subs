00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
in place so that makes it easy because

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
in place so that makes it easy because
you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> off<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.180> clean<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> out

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and screw it back on this tip is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
and screw it back on this tip is
wonderful<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.190> precise<00:00:41.760> I've

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
wonderful because it's very precise I've

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
wonderful because it's very precise I've
got<00:00:42.540> something<00:00:42.780> prepared<00:00:43.079> applique<00:00:43.500> pieces

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
got something prepared applique pieces

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
got something prepared applique pieces
here<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> allows<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
here and you can see that it allows you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
here and you can see that it allows you
to<00:00:45.629> put<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> tiniest<00:00:46.500> drop<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.129> glue

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to put just the tiniest drop of glue

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
to put just the tiniest drop of glue
here<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.090> seam<00:00:48.300> allowance<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.350> glue<00:00:49.530> your

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
here in your seam allowance to glue your

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.540 
here in your seam allowance to glue your
piece<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.149> now<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> tip<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.550> nylon

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
piece down now because the tip is nylon

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
piece down now because the tip is nylon
it<00:00:53.879> won't<00:00:54.059> rust<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.230> glue<00:00:55.410> doesn't<00:00:55.680> stick

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it won't rust and the glue doesn't stick

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760 
it won't rust and the glue doesn't stick
to<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.719> it's<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> clog<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to it and it's not going to clog this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
to it and it's not going to clog this
tip<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.219> tapered<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> see<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.090> wider<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
tip is tapered to see it's wider at the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
tip is tapered to see it's wider at the
bottom<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> allows<00:01:01.949> air<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.430> into<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
bottom so that allows air up into the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
bottom so that allows air up into the
tip<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> glue<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.629> slide<00:01:03.899> back<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.110> into

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
tip so the glue can slide back down into

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
tip so the glue can slide back down into
the<00:01:04.559> bottle<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> doesn't<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.850> clogged<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the bottle so it doesn't get clogged so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
the bottle so it doesn't get clogged so
after<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.380> tap<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
after I use it I just kind of tap it and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
after I use it I just kind of tap it and
the<00:01:08.040> glue<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.369> slide<00:01:08.549> back<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.119> when

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the glue will slide back down in when

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750 
the glue will slide back down in when
I'm<00:01:09.750> done<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.200> whole<00:01:10.409> application<00:01:10.760> I'll

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
I'm done with my whole application I'll

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
I'm done with my whole application I'll
take<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> tip<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:13.080> rinse<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
take the tip off go rinse it out and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.219 
take the tip off go rinse it out and
then<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.060> storage<00:01:15.299> cap<00:01:15.600> back<00:01:15.780> on

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
then put my storage cap back on

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
then put my storage cap back on
I<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> base<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.090> appliquéd

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I use it to base down my appliquéd

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
I use it to base down my appliquéd
pieces<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> base<00:01:20.340> down

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
pieces you can also use it to base down

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
pieces you can also use it to base down
rickrack<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
rickrack and you could use it to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
rickrack and you could use it to
sometimes<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.000> use<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.540> bindings<00:01:25.080> okay

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
sometimes I use it on my bindings okay

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
sometimes I use it on my bindings okay
especially<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> hurry<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.180> also

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
especially if I'm in a hurry it's also

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
especially if I'm in a hurry it's also
the<00:01:27.720> first<00:01:27.930> side<00:01:28.140> down<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> roll<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
years and I realized that I had this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.330 
years and I realized that I had this
basting<00:01:47.850> glue<00:01:47.880> sitting<00:01:48.450> inside<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.350> quilt<00:01:49.649> in
