how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.210> cycling<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.839> tank<00:00:08.000> it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
how to do the cycling of a tank it's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.790 
how to do the cycling of a tank it's
often<00:00:09.300> made<00:00:09.420> out<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.990> really<00:00:10.260> complex

thing the bottom line is you need

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.900 
thing the bottom line is you need
bacteria<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> help<00:00:14.700> make

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
bacteria that are going to help make

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.269 
bacteria that are going to help make
really<00:00:15.389> toxic<00:00:15.900> fish<00:00:16.109> waste<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:17.100> waste

really toxic fish waste in a waste

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.550 
really toxic fish waste in a waste
that's<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> toxic<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.840> lot<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
that's really not that toxic a lot of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
that's really not that toxic a lot of
expensive<00:00:20.100> items<00:00:20.939> out<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.660> cycling

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
expensive items out there for cycling

expensive items out there for cycling
tanks<00:00:22.640> chemicals<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.939> buy<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
tanks chemicals you can buy and if you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
tanks chemicals you can buy and if you
have<00:00:25.410> no<00:00:25.500> access<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.890> any<00:00:26.010> other<00:00:26.310> fish<00:00:26.519> tanks

or if you don't have several fish tanks
like<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.390> other<00:00:30.539> crazy<00:00:30.960> fish

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
like I do or some other crazy fish

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.040 
like I do or some other crazy fish
people<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.679> that's<00:00:32.430> fine<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> really

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
people do that's fine but it's a really

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.870 
people do that's fine but it's a really
easy<00:00:34.140> cheap<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> actually<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.370> effective

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
easy cheap and actually very effective

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.690 
easy cheap and actually very effective
way<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.719> take<00:00:36.870> care<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> problem<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
way to take care of this problem and the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.670 
way to take care of this problem and the
trick<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.390> take<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> bacteria<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
trick is to take the bacteria from a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
trick is to take the bacteria from a
tank<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.100> doing<00:00:41.340> fine<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.940> move<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
tank that's doing fine and move it to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.389 
tank that's doing fine and move it to
the<00:00:43.140> tank<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.950> starting<00:00:44.280> off

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the tank that you're just starting off

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.400 
the tank that you're just starting off
with<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> take<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.899> tank<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.289> I'm

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
with so you take this tank here I'm

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
with so you take this tank here I'm
doing<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.680> water<00:00:46.860> change<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.610> move<00:00:47.789> some

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
doing a water change on I just move some

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
doing a water change on I just move some
fish<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> filter

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
fish out of it and you take a filter

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830 
fish out of it and you take a filter
here<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> simple<00:00:50.760> sponge<00:00:51.149> filter<00:00:51.570> will<00:00:51.660> do

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
here just a simple sponge filter will do

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.189 
here just a simple sponge filter will do
you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.500> also<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:52.949> gravel<00:00:54.199> you

rock<00:02:18.160> X<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.580> moved<00:02:18.819> from<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.030> freshwater<00:02:19.239> tank

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
rock X was moved from a freshwater tank

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.120 
rock X was moved from a freshwater tank
it<00:02:19.720> probably<00:02:19.959> has<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> good<00:02:20.349> bacteria<00:02:20.560> with<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
it probably has a good bacteria with it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.500 
it probably has a good bacteria with it
well<00:02:21.730> here<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.030> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> take<00:02:22.300> this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
well here I'm going to take this

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
well here I'm going to take this
chocolate<00:02:23.470> milk<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.830> seems<00:02:24.010> horrible<00:02:24.459> oh

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
chocolate milk it seems horrible oh

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.860 
chocolate milk it seems horrible oh
you're<00:02:24.790> pouring<00:02:25.000> waste<00:02:25.269> into<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.630> fish<00:02:25.840> tank

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
you're pouring waste into a fish tank

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.839 
you're pouring waste into a fish tank
well<00:02:26.290> you're<00:02:27.099> actually<00:02:27.310> putting<00:02:27.489> healthy

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
well you're actually putting healthy

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.080 
well you're actually putting healthy
bacteria<00:02:28.060> into<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.599> fish<00:02:28.810> tank<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:30.090> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
bacteria into this fish tank so this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.530 
bacteria into this fish tank so this
healthy<00:02:31.330> bacteria<00:02:33.209> mixes<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.360> here<00:02:36.540> what

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
healthy bacteria mixes in here what

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.000 
healthy bacteria mixes in here what
you're<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.019> if<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.799> have<00:02:38.890> this

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you're going to have if you have this

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.130 
you're going to have if you have this
good<00:02:39.220> circulation<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.870> can<00:02:40.989> see<00:02:41.110> a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
good circulation here as you can see a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.610 
good circulation here as you can see a
couple<00:02:41.500> powerheads<00:02:41.950> helpful<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.610> circulation

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
couple powerheads helpful in circulation

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.780 
couple powerheads helpful in circulation
is<00:02:44.620> you're<00:02:44.739> going<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.950> have<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.310> bacteria

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
is you're going to have that bacteria

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.030 
is you're going to have that bacteria
spread<00:02:46.120> throughout<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.690> attach<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.799> things

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
spread throughout and attach to things

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
spread throughout and attach to things
then<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.400> exposed<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.910> oxygen<00:02:49.030> which<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.450> key

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
then be exposed to oxygen which is key

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.449 
then be exposed to oxygen which is key
because<00:02:50.380> these<00:02:50.709> bacteria<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.250> break<00:02:51.310> down

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
because these bacteria that break down

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.420 
because these bacteria that break down
the<00:02:51.790> waste<00:02:51.970> new<00:02:52.239> fish<00:02:52.420> tanks<00:02:52.810> are<00:02:53.470> aerobic<00:02:54.280> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
the waste new fish tanks are aerobic and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.680 
the waste new fish tanks are aerobic and
they<00:02:54.489> need<00:02:54.670> oxygen<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.390> what's<00:02:58.540> going<00:02:58.660> to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
they need oxygen so what's going to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.420 
they need oxygen so what's going to
happen<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.140> now<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.530> all<00:02:59.709> those<00:02:59.920> bacteria

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
happen here now is all those bacteria

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280 
happen here now is all those bacteria
they<00:03:01.150> were<00:03:01.209> living<00:03:01.569> there<00:03:01.870> eating<00:03:02.110> waste

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
they were living there eating waste

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.449 
they were living there eating waste
they're<00:03:02.530> doing<00:03:02.739> fine<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> worry

you<00:03:05.530> know<00:03:05.650> they're<00:03:05.829> alive<00:03:06.100> because<00:03:06.370> they're

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
you know they're alive because they're

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.180 
you know they're alive because they're
eating<00:03:06.820> an<00:03:07.000> old<00:03:07.180> fish<00:03:07.420> tank<00:03:07.980> they're<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.130> to
