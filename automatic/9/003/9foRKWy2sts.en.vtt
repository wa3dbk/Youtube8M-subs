new snapshot be summoning a fireball as
an<00:00:15.599> example<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> does<00:00:16.500> work<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:17.039> others

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
an example but it does work with others

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
with a spawn egg the firewall will be

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
with a spawn egg the firewall will be
summoned<00:00:27.210> where<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:27.779> currently<00:00:27.960> standing

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
summoned where we're currently standing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.460 
summoned where we're currently standing
well<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.789> summoned<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.869> i<00:00:30.900> explained

that<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> moment<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> how<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.079> actually

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that in a moment so how does it actually

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
that in a moment so how does it actually
work<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.100> command<00:00:53.430> block<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.940> constantly

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
work this command block will constantly

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
work this command block will constantly
check<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> spawn<00:00:55.710> egg<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.980> its<00:00:56.160> own

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
check if we use the spawn egg on its own

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
check if we use the spawn egg on its own
this<00:00:57.000> comparative<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.719> output<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> signal

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this comparative will output is signal

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.080 
this comparative will output is signal
to<00:00:58.829> trigger<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> following<00:00:59.910> command

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to trigger all the following command

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.139 
to trigger all the following command
blocks<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.670> summon<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
blocks the first one will summon the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
blocks the first one will summon the
fiber<00:01:03.420> relative<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> command<00:01:04.769> book

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
fiber relative to the command book

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
fiber relative to the command book
without<00:01:05.939> any<00:01:06.240> velocity<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.500> moving

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
without any velocity so it's not moving

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.820 
without any velocity so it's not moving
at<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.450> these<00:01:09.450> two<00:01:09.750> commands<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.380> magic

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
at all these two commands to the magic

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
at all these two commands to the magic
because<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> new<00:01:11.460> snapshot<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.479> target

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
because a new snapshot we can now target

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.399 
because a new snapshot we can now target
entities<00:01:13.409> commands<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.909> @e<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.170> specify

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
entities commands with @e we can specify

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
entities commands with @e we can specify
them<00:01:16.860> even<00:01:17.130> further<00:01:17.390> here<00:01:18.390> use<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> type<00:01:19.020> for

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
them even further here use the type for

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
them even further here use the type for
the<00:01:19.439> fireball<00:01:20.150> this<00:01:21.150> command<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.780> teleport

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the fireball this command will teleport

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
the fireball this command will teleport
the<00:01:22.409> firewall<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> player<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.700> can

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the firewall to the player so we can

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
the firewall to the player so we can
left-click<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.479> shoot<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.799> actually

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
left-click to shoot it we actually

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.950 
left-click to shoot it we actually
teleport<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> fireball<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.479> after<00:01:27.689> we

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
teleport the fireball up a bit after we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
teleport the fireball up a bit after we
teleported<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> player<00:01:29.150> otherwise<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
teleported into the player otherwise the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
teleported into the player otherwise the
fireball<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.290> closer<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> ground

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fireball would be closer to the ground

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.569 
fireball would be closer to the ground
and<00:01:32.909> would<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.210> difficult<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.720> use<00:01:34.490> finally<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
and would be difficult to use finally we

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.190 
and would be difficult to use finally we
just<00:01:35.820> reset<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> mobile<00:01:36.570> users<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
just reset the mobile users for the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
just reset the mobile users for the
player<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> repeat<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.820> process<00:01:39.229> here

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
player so we can repeat the process here

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
player so we can repeat the process here
to<00:01:40.470> use<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.829> actual<00:01:41.159> name<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> command

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to use my actual name in the command

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
to use my actual name in the command
because<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.930> couldn't<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.040> I'm

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because I couldn't use at any but I'm

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.609 
because I couldn't use at any but I'm
pretty<00:01:44.280> sure<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> snapshot<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
pretty sure this in the snapshot it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.670 
pretty sure this in the snapshot it
might<00:01:46.829> already<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.280> fixed<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> next<00:01:48.060> one

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
might already be fixed then the next one

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.749 
might already be fixed then the next one
this<00:01:49.680> video<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.430> quick<00:01:50.640> demonstration

of one thing that is possible you slap
shot<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.240> few<00:01:54.450> adjustments<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.170> can

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
shot with a few adjustments you can

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
shot with a few adjustments you can
really<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> process<00:01:56.130> multiplayer

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
really make the process multiplayer

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749 
really make the process multiplayer
friendly<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> lot<00:01:58.020> faster<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:59.549> always
