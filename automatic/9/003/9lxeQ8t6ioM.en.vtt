going to get into effect veiler now we
all<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.099> fail<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.429> does<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
all know what if I fail or does you

all know what if I fail or does you
discard<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.539> hand<00:00:30.869> during<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> main<00:00:31.289> phase

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
discard from hand during the main phase

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530 
discard from hand during the main phase
you<00:00:32.160> target<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> monster<00:00:33.060> on<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.240> field<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you target a monster on the field you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.049 
you target a monster on the field you
negate<00:00:33.840> its<00:00:34.050> effects<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
negate its effects now the thing is it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
negate its effects now the thing is it
lasts<00:00:36.510> until<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.899> end<00:00:37.079> phase<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
lasts until the end phase and the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
lasts until the end phase and the
question<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> well<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.180> constitutes<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
question is well what constitutes at it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
question is well what constitutes at it
as<00:00:40.289> an<00:00:40.530> ending<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> N<00:00:41.039> face<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.399> exactly

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
as an ending on the N face what exactly

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.420 
as an ending on the N face what exactly
happens<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:43.020> most<00:00:43.260> people<00:00:43.559> assume<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.100> soon

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
happens now most people assume as soon

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
happens now most people assume as soon
as<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> n<00:00:44.820> phase<00:00:45.030> occurs<00:00:45.360> its<00:00:45.809> effect

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
as the n phase occurs its effect

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
as the n phase occurs its effect
suddenly<00:00:46.920> fizzles<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
suddenly fizzles but that's not how the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
suddenly fizzles but that's not how the
card<00:00:48.719> works<00:00:48.780> that's<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.620> works<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
card works that's how the game works and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
card works that's how the game works and
a<00:00:50.399> resolution<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:51.180> must<00:00:51.420> occur<00:00:51.719> once<00:00:52.170> an

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a resolution still must occur once an

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.270 
a resolution still must occur once an
effect<00:00:52.590> activates

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
effect activates

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
effect activates
in<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:54.030> case<00:00:54.359> effect<00:00:54.809> failures<00:00:55.199> effect

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in this case effect failures effect

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.299 
in this case effect failures effect
lingers<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.579> resolves<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> n<00:00:57.840> phase

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
lingers and then resolves on the n phase

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.380 
lingers and then resolves on the n phase
so<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> works

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
so this is the way it works

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
so this is the way it works
turn<00:01:00.930> player<00:01:01.199> always<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> first

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
turn player always has the first

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
turn player always has the first
opportunity<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> resolve<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.629> effect<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.559> can

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
opportunity to resolve an effect he can

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.650 
opportunity to resolve an effect he can
choose<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> resolve<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> choose

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
choose to resolve it or you can choose

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.630 
choose to resolve it or you can choose
to<00:01:07.230> have<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.530> opponent<00:01:07.800> resolve<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.370> effect

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to have an opponent resolve an effect

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
to have an opponent resolve an effect
first<00:01:08.910> so<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.210> passes<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> priority<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
first so he passes a priority to the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
first so he passes a priority to the
opponent<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.040> point<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> opponent<00:01:12.000> can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
opponent at this point the opponent can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
opponent at this point the opponent can
choose<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.480> resolve<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.840> effect<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.350> pass<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
choose to resolve in effect or pass it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
choose to resolve in effect or pass it
back<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.310> turn<00:01:14.580> player<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.750> point<00:01:16.050> turn

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
back to turn player at this point turn

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.710 
back to turn player at this point turn
player<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.100> forced<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.580> resolve<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.120> effect<00:01:18.480> if

player is forced to resolve in effect if
his<00:01:19.230> opponent<00:01:19.440> chooses<00:01:19.800> not<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> whether<00:01:20.790> or

here's<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.830> example<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.540> attack

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
here's an example you have an attack

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
here's an example you have an attack
position<00:01:28.020> wind-up<00:01:28.590> zenmaines<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.880> attack<00:01:30.180> my

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
position wind-up zenmaines you attack my

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240

higher<00:01:30.660> attack<00:01:31.080> box<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.620> that's<00:01:31.740> also<00:01:31.980> an

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
higher attack box and that's also an

you and resolving my mind control effect

so<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.329> really<00:02:34.540> important<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.959> note

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
so this is really important to note

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.420 
so this is really important to note
because<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.319> lot<00:02:35.469> of<00:02:35.500> people<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.920> mix<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.250> up

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
because a lot of people do mix this up

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.099 
because a lot of people do mix this up
and<00:02:36.670> they<00:02:36.969> say<00:02:37.120> oh<00:02:37.150> well<00:02:37.480> you're<00:02:37.629> on<00:02:37.719> n<00:02:37.900> phase

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
and they say oh well you're on n phase

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.690 
and they say oh well you're on n phase
you<00:02:38.349> don't<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.829> use<00:02:38.980> those<00:02:39.159> effects<00:02:39.489> or

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
you don't get to use those effects or

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.309 
you don't get to use those effects or
you<00:02:39.879> do<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.329> use<00:02:40.419> the<00:02:40.540> effect<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.169> in

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
you do get to use the effect but in

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.140 
you do get to use the effect but in
these<00:02:41.469> specific<00:02:41.950> scenarios<00:02:42.400> as<00:02:42.579> you<00:02:42.819> can<00:02:42.969> see

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
these specific scenarios as you can see

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.729 
these specific scenarios as you can see
this<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.480> exactly<00:02:43.870> how<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.109> works

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
this is exactly how it works

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.199 
this is exactly how it works
so<00:02:45.010> hopefully<00:02:45.189> this<00:02:45.459> can<00:02:45.639> clarify<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:46.120> few

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
so hopefully this can clarify a few

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.330 
so hopefully this can clarify a few
things<00:02:46.719> now<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.439> next<00:02:47.680> ruling<00:02:48.069> I'm<00:02:48.159> going<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
things now the next ruling I'm going to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.339 
things now the next ruling I'm going to
cover<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.819> spirit<00:02:49.269> Reaper<00:02:49.569> now<00:02:50.109> a<00:02:50.139> lot<00:02:50.290> of

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
cover is on spirit Reaper now a lot of

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.619 
cover is on spirit Reaper now a lot of
people<00:02:50.590> get<00:02:50.709> confused<00:02:50.829> as<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.669> what<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.329> and

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
people get confused as to what is and

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.089 
people get confused as to what is and
what<00:02:52.659> isn't<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.199> continuous<00:02:53.650> effect<00:02:53.889> and

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
what isn't a continuous effect and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.490 
what isn't a continuous effect and
nine-time<00:02:55.000> sometimes<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.750> best<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.199> to<00:02:56.230> do

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
nine-time sometimes the best thing to do

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.379 
nine-time sometimes the best thing to do
is<00:02:56.859> just<00:02:57.129> look<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.430> up<00:02:57.489> online<00:02:57.730> it'll

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
is just look it up online it'll

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.259 
is just look it up online it'll
immediately<00:02:58.629> appear<00:02:59.379> on<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.069> wiki<00:03:00.280> page<00:03:00.790> if

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
immediately appear on the wiki page if

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.420 
immediately appear on the wiki page if
it's<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.540> trigger<00:03:01.750> continuous<00:03:02.469> ignition<00:03:02.859> etc

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
it's a trigger continuous ignition etc

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.699 
it's a trigger continuous ignition etc
and<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.599> way<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:04.989> determine<00:03:05.290> what<00:03:05.590> it

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
and that way you can determine what it

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.789 
and that way you can determine what it
really<00:03:05.829> does<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.989> no<00:03:07.989> more<00:03:08.169> confusion<00:03:08.469> on

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
really does and no more confusion on

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.069 
really does and no more confusion on
that<00:03:08.829> but<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.819> case<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.299> spirit<00:03:10.780> Reaper

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
that but in the case of spirit Reaper

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.349 
that but in the case of spirit Reaper

its effect to destroy itself when it's

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.509 
its effect to destroy itself when it's
targeted<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> continuous<00:03:14.590> effect<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.400> same

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
targeted is a continuous effect the same

though<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.620> always<00:03:26.949> good<00:03:27.189> to<00:03:27.220> make<00:03:27.459> sure<00:03:27.639> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
though it's always good to make sure and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.879 
though it's always good to make sure and
look<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:28.000> up<00:03:28.120> by<00:03:28.689> just<00:03:28.989> looking<00:03:29.409> at<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.709> fact

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
look it up by just looking at the fact

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.619 
look it up by just looking at the fact
that<00:03:29.949> it<00:03:30.280> can't<00:03:30.579> logically<00:03:31.000> fit<00:03:31.299> into<00:03:31.419> the

that it can't logically fit into the

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.689 
that it can't logically fit into the
chain<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.169> were<00:03:32.319> effect<00:03:32.889> that<00:03:33.040> activated

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
chain if it were effect that activated

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.399 
chain if it were effect that activated
for<00:03:34.209> example<00:03:34.509> it<00:03:34.659> would<00:03:34.780> make<00:03:34.930> absolutely<00:03:35.319> no

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
for example it would make absolutely no

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.319 
for example it would make absolutely no
sense<00:03:35.590> if<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.829> activated<00:03:36.250> dark<00:03:36.549> hole<00:03:36.729> and<00:03:37.000> Zen

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
sense if you activated dark hole and Zen

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.879 
sense if you activated dark hole and Zen
means<00:03:37.569> chained<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.199> that<00:03:38.229> dark<00:03:38.560> hole<00:03:38.739> to

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
means chained to that dark hole to

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.409 
means chained to that dark hole to
protect<00:03:39.159> itself<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.909> just<00:03:40.120> doesn't<00:03:40.299> make<00:03:40.359> any

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
protect itself it just doesn't make any

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.210 
protect itself it just doesn't make any
sense<00:03:40.689> so<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:41.620> one<00:03:41.859> of<00:03:41.949> the<00:03:42.009> ways<00:03:42.099> to

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
sense so that's one of the ways to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.219 
sense so that's one of the ways to
determine<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.699> now<00:03:43.120> spirit<00:03:43.629> Reaper<00:03:43.870> the

determine that now spirit Reaper the

thing is and all continuous effects like

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.179 
thing is and all continuous effects like
the<00:03:46.689> ones<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.959> mentioned<00:03:47.019> they<00:03:47.799> have<00:03:48.040> to

would be destroying them has to
completely<00:03:51.970> resolve<00:03:52.180> for<00:03:52.780> their<00:03:52.870> effects<00:03:53.139> to

Reaper

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.920

then<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.610> destroy<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.300> gain<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.480> thousand

then you destroy it you gain a thousand

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.260 
then you destroy it you gain a thousand
and<00:04:39.110> then<00:04:39.260> spirit<00:04:39.710> Reaper<00:04:40.040> would<00:04:40.640> activate<00:04:41.090> at

and then spirit Reaper would activate at
this<00:04:41.390> point<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:41.900> can't<00:04:42.200> because<00:04:42.530> it's

this point but can't because it's

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.470
