all-weather mats which are coming with
the<00:03:15.079> vehicle<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.669> like<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.269> idea<00:03:17.599> of<00:03:17.840> just

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
the vehicle now I like the idea of just

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.319 
the vehicle now I like the idea of just
being<00:03:18.590> able<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.979> push<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> button<00:03:19.639> basically

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
being able to push a button basically

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.360 
being able to push a button basically
and<00:03:20.569> you're<00:03:20.900> able<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.169> fold<00:03:21.500> down<00:03:21.739> these<00:03:22.040> seats

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
and you're able to fold down these seats

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.099 
and you're able to fold down these seats
so<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.579> may<00:03:22.819> already<00:03:23.000> be<00:03:23.180> aware<00:03:23.419> that<00:03:23.629> this<00:03:23.959> is

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
so you may already be aware that this is

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.780 
so you may already be aware that this is
what<00:03:24.259> happens<00:03:24.680> with<00:03:24.859> these<00:03:25.069> but<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
what happens with these but the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520
