replacement for the CNC levers the shift

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
replacement for the CNC levers the shift
tips<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.259> available<00:01:19.590> different<00:01:20.250> sizes<00:01:20.700> of

different<00:01:20.850> offsets<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
different offsets so that they can

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010 
different offsets so that they can
accommodate<00:01:22.979> different<00:01:23.520> boot<00:01:23.670> sizes<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.509> what

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
accommodate different boot sizes so what

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
accommodate different boot sizes so what
you'll<00:01:25.140> notice<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.920> excuse<00:01:26.490> me<00:01:26.610> what

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you'll notice here here excuse me what

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
you'll notice here here excuse me what
you'll<00:01:26.820> notice<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you'll notice on this one is it's got a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
you'll notice on this one is it's got a
zero<00:01:29.390> plus<00:01:30.390> zero<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.990> means<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
zero plus zero so that means it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
zero plus zero so that means it's
basically<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.650> stock<00:01:31.950> size<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.540> we

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
basically a stock size right then we

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.060 
basically a stock size right then we
look<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.079> replacement<00:01:34.710> tips<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
look at these replacement tips we have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.569 
look at these replacement tips we have
over<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.579> another<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.720> plus<00:01:37.439> zero<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.369> one

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
over here another one plus zero this one

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.660 
over here another one plus zero this one
over<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> orange<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.320> plus<00:01:40.710> 20<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
over here the orange one is a plus 20 so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
over here the orange one is a plus 20 so
if<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> two<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> these<00:01:42.509> together

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
if we look at the two of these together

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
if we look at the two of these together
you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.430> quite<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you can see that's quite a bit of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
you can see that's quite a bit of
difference<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> means<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
difference and that means if you have a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
difference and that means if you have a
larger<00:01:46.890> boot<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> better<00:01:48.119> size

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
larger boot this would be a better size
