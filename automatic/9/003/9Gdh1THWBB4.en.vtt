still you can put it in the tool and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.380 
still you can put it in the tool and
then<00:01:54.899> you'll<00:01:55.110> stop<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:56.009> sooner

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
then you'll stop it a little bit sooner

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.760 
then you'll stop it a little bit sooner
