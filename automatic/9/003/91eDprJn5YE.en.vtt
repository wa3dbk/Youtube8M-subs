over-the-door double hook and I use that
for<00:01:47.970> extra<00:01:48.780> hanging<00:01:48.990> space<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.009> drawing

for extra hanging space when I'm drawing

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.660 
for extra hanging space when I'm drawing
things<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.720> okay<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> hang<00:01:52.490> things<00:01:53.490> like

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
things that are okay to hang things like

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.389 
things that are okay to hang things like
hoodies<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> sweatshirts<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.130> gives<00:01:56.310> me

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
hoodies and sweatshirts it just gives me

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.139 
hoodies and sweatshirts it just gives me
some<00:01:56.640> extra<00:01:56.909> space<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.509> hanging<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:59.610> guess

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
some extra space for hanging and I guess

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
some extra space for hanging and I guess
that's<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.659> much<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.280> any

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that's pretty much it if you have any

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.130 
that's pretty much it if you have any
questions<00:02:02.969> let<00:02:03.540> me<00:02:03.570> know
