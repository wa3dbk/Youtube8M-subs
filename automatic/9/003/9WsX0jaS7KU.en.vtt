vide about like this about this i I'm
sorry<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.529> found<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:16.949> last<00:00:17.220> night

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
sorry I just found this out last night

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.130 
sorry I just found this out last night
you<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> didn't<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.050> before

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you know I didn't know about it before

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960 
you know I didn't know about it before
so<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.130> didn't<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.699> you

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so if I didn't know about it you

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700 
so if I didn't know about it you
probably<00:00:21.150> don't<00:00:21.270> either<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.199> when<00:00:22.590> you

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
probably don't either but when you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.910 
probably don't either but when you
actually<00:00:22.890> shoot<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:23.730> gun<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.900> KSG<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.650> kind

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
actually shoot your gun the KSG is kind

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.320 
actually shoot your gun the KSG is kind
of<00:00:26.010> good<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> pump-action<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of good but it's a pump-action as you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
of good but it's a pump-action as you
can<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> shoot<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
can see here when you shoot it if the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
can see here when you shoot it if the
pump<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> that's<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:30.900> fast<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
pump it and that's not as fast as you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.749 
pump it and that's not as fast as you
can<00:00:31.380> shoot<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.740> between<00:00:32.040> shots<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> found

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
can shoot in between shots when I found

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.130 
can shoot in between shots when I found
a<00:00:32.850> trick<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> let<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.780> double

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
a trick that's going to let you double

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.130 
a trick that's going to let you double
the<00:00:34.170> speed<00:00:35.360> even<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.870> more<00:00:37.079> than

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the speed even a little bit more than

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
the speed even a little bit more than
double<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> shoot<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.430> three<00:00:39.270> times<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
double you can shoot two three times in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.729 
double you can shoot two three times in
the<00:00:40.260> mountain<00:00:40.620> takes<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> shoot<00:00:41.790> twice

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
the mountain takes you to shoot twice

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
the mountain takes you to shoot twice
which<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.550> changes<00:00:44.879> everything<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.450> know

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
which is the changes everything you know

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
which is the changes everything you know
it<00:00:45.660> makes<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> KSG<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.559> better<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it makes the KSG a lot better now it is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
it makes the KSG a lot better now it is
a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.180> tricky<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
a little tricky to do but you know it it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.310 
a little tricky to do but you know it it
takes<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.420> getting<00:00:51.510> used<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.020> here

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
takes a little getting used to but here

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.569 
takes a little getting used to but here
it<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> hit<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.340> trigger

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it is you want to hit the right trigger

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
it is you want to hit the right trigger
X<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.600> push<00:00:54.840> forward<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> same<00:00:55.320> time

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
X and then push forward at the same time

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
X and then push forward at the same time
then<00:00:56.219> when<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.850> fast

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
then when you do it really really fast

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
then when you do it really really fast
as<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.899> i'm<00:00:58.079> shooting<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.920> much

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
as you can see i'm shooting so much

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
as you can see i'm shooting so much
faster<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:01.020> three<00:01:01.500> times

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
faster you can get about three times

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170 
faster you can get about three times
even<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.430> look<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> bottom<00:01:02.940> right

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
even if you look on the bottom right

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
even if you look on the bottom right
it's<00:01:03.420> sometimes<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.680> messed<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:05.010> there

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it's sometimes I kind of messed up there

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's sometimes I kind of messed up there
it<00:01:05.519> does<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.570> while<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.350> used

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it does take a little while to get used

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
it does take a little while to get used
to<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.130> sometimes<00:01:08.310> even<00:01:08.850> doesn't<00:01:09.150> even

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to but it's sometimes even doesn't even

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
to but it's sometimes even doesn't even

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
take out the bullet that you just shot
that<00:01:11.909> changes<00:01:12.270> everything<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.960> makes<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that changes everything that makes it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
that changes everything that makes it
