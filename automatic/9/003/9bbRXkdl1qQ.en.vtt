00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
released nuts sparked a little bit of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.029 
released nuts sparked a little bit of
controversy<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.359> ho<00:00:24.720> let's<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> again<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.349 
controversy so ho let's do it again I
don't<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.580> one's<00:00:26.760> gonna<00:00:26.910> actually

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
don't think this one's gonna actually

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359

define<00:00:27.689> any<00:00:27.990> controversy<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.010> honest<00:00:29.250> at

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
define any controversy to be honest at

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
define any controversy to be honest at
all<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:30.119> it'll<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:30.990> interesting<00:00:31.289> because

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
all but it'll be interesting because

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.790 
all but it'll be interesting because
it's<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.759> discussion<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.540> whether<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.590> they

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's a discussion on whether or not they

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
it's a discussion on whether or not they
should<00:00:34.829> hit<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> banlist

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

the hands have kind of been thrown in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
the hands have kind of been thrown in
every<00:00:38.190> deck<00:00:38.430> possible<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.329> they're<00:00:40.079> seen

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
cards and a big kind of hurdle for your

getting them rolling it means that your

getting them rolling it means that your

that fire or ice hands and play around
it<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.289> many<00:00:55.469> decks<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> actually

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it there's not many decks to actually

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.549 
it there's not many decks to actually
set<00:00:56.640> cards<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> current<00:00:57.870> matter<00:00:58.109> apart

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
gears with the armor so on so forth so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.509 
gears with the armor so on so forth so
there<00:01:04.229> aren't<00:01:04.409> many<00:01:04.680> decks<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> will

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
there aren't many decks that will

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.640 
there aren't many decks that will
actually<00:01:05.939> set<00:01:06.299> something<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
actually set something so you can go

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
actually set something so you can go
maybe<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.369> six<00:01:08.640> times<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> ten<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
maybe like six times out of ten is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
maybe like six times out of ten is
probably<00:01:09.930> gonna<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> hands<00:01:10.979> they

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
probably gonna be one of the hands they

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
probably gonna be one of the hands they
kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> facilitate<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.650> special<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
kind of facilitate a special bit of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
kind of facilitate a special bit of
antimatter<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.970> certain<00:01:15.390> decks<00:01:15.689> they're<00:01:16.020> just

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
antimatter in certain decks they're just

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.980 
antimatter in certain decks they're just
generically<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.330> might

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
generically good for what they do might

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
generically good for what they do might
sound<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.590> contradicting<00:01:20.070> myself<00:01:20.490> with

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
sound like I'm contradicting myself with

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
sound like I'm contradicting myself with
the<00:01:21.270> original<00:01:21.750> discussion<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> still

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the original discussion but I still

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.090 
the original discussion but I still
believe<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.790> aren't<00:01:24.090> broken<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.259> still<00:01:25.740> stand

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
believe they aren't broken I still stand

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
believe they aren't broken I still stand
by<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> statement<00:01:26.610> saying<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.900> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
by the statement saying that they are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
by the statement saying that they are
very<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.770> cards<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.520> said<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
very good cards and I said that in the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
very good cards and I said that in the
previous<00:01:30.390> video<00:01:30.869> don't<00:01:31.710> believe<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.340> watch

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
previous video don't believe me go watch

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
previous video don't believe me go watch
it<00:01:32.549> again<00:01:32.759> whether<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.780> should<00:01:33.810> hit

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it again whether or not they should hit

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.969 
it again whether or not they should hit
the<00:01:34.200> banlist

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the banlist

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.670 
the banlist
is<00:01:35.100> an<00:01:35.759> interesting<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is an interesting one I don't think this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
is an interesting one I don't think this
should<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.890> bands<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:38.820> believe

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
should be bands like I don't believe

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.359 
should be bands like I don't believe
they're<00:01:39.509> warranted<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.170> bands<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
they're warranted to be bands because it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
they're warranted to be bands because it
just<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:42.060> sense

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
just doesn't make sense

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
just doesn't make sense
pon<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.740> doesn't<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.460> do

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
pon them to to doesn't really do

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
pon them to to doesn't really do
anything<00:01:45.270> apart<00:01:45.479> from<00:01:45.750> maybe<00:01:46.049> free<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.560> two

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
really gonna make much of a difference

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
really gonna make much of a difference
because<00:02:03.509> people<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.049> still<00:02:04.200> gonna<00:02:04.350> play<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.890> -

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
if you put it 2-1 then people won't play

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190

abandon them is just completely

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.420

me why you would do that I can see why
they<00:02:32.850> might<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:34.950> mind<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.340> doesn't

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
they might but in my mind it doesn't

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.700 
they might but in my mind it doesn't
make<00:02:35.670> sense<00:02:35.880> maybe<00:02:36.210> Konami<00:02:36.960> didn't<00:02:37.260> mind<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
make sense maybe Konami didn't mind it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.170 
make sense maybe Konami didn't mind it
might<00:02:37.830> make<00:02:37.980> sense<00:02:38.190> they've<00:02:38.550> kind<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.910> taken

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
might make sense they've kind of taken

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
might make sense they've kind of taken
the<00:02:39.660> matter<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.990> little<00:02:40.500> bit<00:02:40.590> by<00:02:40.710> storm<00:02:41.070> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the matter a little bit by storm and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.820 
the matter a little bit by storm and
everyone<00:02:42.060> plays<00:02:42.300> them<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.810> said<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.440> just

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
everyone plays them as I said I just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.010 
everyone plays them as I said I just
feel<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.490> aren't<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.180> problem<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
feel that they aren't the problem in the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.200 
feel that they aren't the problem in the
matter<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:47.070> there<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.400> many<00:02:47.520> different

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
matter like there are many different

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.900 
matter like there are many different
decks<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.930> play<00:02:49.200> Fire<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.980> Ice<00:02:50.160> hands<00:02:50.490> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
decks that play Fire and Ice hands and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.600 
decks that play Fire and Ice hands and
basically<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> said<00:02:51.960> every<00:02:52.470> deck<00:02:52.710> puts<00:02:53.340> like

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
basically as I said every deck puts like

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.730 
basically as I said every deck puts like
two<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.210> three<00:02:54.240> copies<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.960> there<00:02:55.170> tear<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
two or three copies in there tear is the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.470 
two or three copies in there tear is the
best<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.100> my<00:02:56.190> opinion<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.330> least

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
best in my opinion because it's at least

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.090 
best in my opinion because it's at least
a<00:02:57.690> less<00:02:57.840> clogged<00:02:58.050> innocent<00:02:58.440> dead<00:02:58.590> Rory<00:02:58.860> I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a less clogged innocent dead Rory I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.910 
a less clogged innocent dead Rory I
believe<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.880> they<00:03:00.270> should<00:03:00.300> be<00:03:01.080> put<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.680> maybe

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
believe that they should be put to maybe

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.030 
believe that they should be put to maybe
one<00:03:02.310> if<00:03:02.670> people<00:03:03.240> are<00:03:03.390> moaning<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:04.290> much<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
one if people are moaning that much and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.490 
one if people are moaning that much and
people<00:03:05.640> feel<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.420> actual<00:03:06.720> game<00:03:07.140> state

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
people feel that the actual game state

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.880 
people feel that the actual game state
is<00:03:07.770> ruined<00:03:08.250> by<00:03:08.580> them<00:03:08.850> because<00:03:09.200> that's<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
is ruined by them because that's the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.800 
is ruined by them because that's the
only<00:03:11.430> thing<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.940> could<00:03:12.060> happen<00:03:12.240> either

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
only thing that could happen either

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.260 
only thing that could happen either
point<00:03:13.140> them<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.680> banning<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.640> them<00:03:14.760> to

point them to one banning one of them to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.270 
point them to one banning one of them to
make<00:03:15.450> them<00:03:15.630> kinda<00:03:15.960> just<00:03:16.110> pointless<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
make them kinda just pointless and to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.250 
make them kinda just pointless and to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
make them not playable we have a lot of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
make them not playable we have a lot of
decks<00:03:19.590> coming<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.460> are<00:03:20.640> gonna<00:03:20.850> be<00:03:21.000> very

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
decks coming out that are gonna be very

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
decks coming out that are gonna be very
strong<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.230> feel<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:23.130> should<00:03:23.370> really
