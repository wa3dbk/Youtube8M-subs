00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.770
 now they are very quiet and lazy 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.170
 with a weapon of this idem and plastic 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.239
 and even the victim recognized the water that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.860

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.170
 guidelines so that it does not 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.959
