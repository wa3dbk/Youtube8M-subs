00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.660
 we celebrate today a new anniversary of the May Revolution of 1810 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.459
 in that historic day 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.689
 the patriots gathered in the town hall of buenos aires 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.970
 with the support of many people who attended the square 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 making an important decision for our future 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.730
 sharmarke the first government between fatherland 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.710
 which was the first meeting headed by Cornelio Saavedra Mariano Moreno and Juan 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 jose step 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 do not know if they will be simple 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 because it implied without specifying more of internal 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.630
 this is because it started alert against the Spanish troops that wanted to 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.560
 conquest of the government 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.600
 but we are also mundane because although the vast majority agrees or 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.520
 I agree with a government of our own, they cut the ties that united us that made us 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 depend on Spain 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 there were different visions about policy and economic orientation 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 that the new creole government should have 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.310
 the spirit of the May Revolution 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 it spread little by little with the provinces of the interior 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.760
 and by the end of that year the totality of the non-existent province in that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.550
 time 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.930
 they had sent their own representatives to form the board 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.000
 large the governing body that was placed at the first board 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.650
 meeting 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.370
 the meadow of independence was long 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.860
 but much more extensive were the internal struggles that began in 1810 and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.380
 they finished more than 60 years later when it is done affirmed the organization 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.920
 national with the integration of the provinces of the interior and Buenos Aires 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.730
 in a single federal government 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 more than two centuries of that day have passed 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.130
 perhaps until now the most important in our history as a country 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.760
 during this time we were giving shape to our homeland 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 word that means the land of the parents 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.090
 to know our history is to know where we came from and where we are going 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.920
 that is why the national dates are cut, it has to be used to think about the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.110
 present and to ask ourselves if each one of us makes his contribution to 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.969
 build day by day the great country that our parents dreamed 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.319
 in this difficult work of building a homeland that has 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.619
 200 a year of life 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.579
 we have had successes and failures 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.659
 sometimes 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.950
 we have fallen in internal struggles that have pushed us back 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:48.899
 but many other times we Argentines have worked hard to build a 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.379
 great country 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.309
 It is in those cases when we use the message left to us by those who 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.349
 rainy day of may 1810 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.489
 they decided that it was time to walk alone and tell the world I want a 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.519
 new country were doing thank you
