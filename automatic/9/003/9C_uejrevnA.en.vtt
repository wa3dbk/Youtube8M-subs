just<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.250> year<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
just one year but at the same time you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
just one year but at the same time you
know<00:00:55.020> people<00:00:55.530> say<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.309> change

a<00:00:56.760> lot<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.239> year<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.170> happen

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
a lot in one year and a lot can happen

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700 
a lot in one year and a lot can happen
that<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.910> true<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.480> mean<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> doesn't<00:01:01.559> feel

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that is so true I mean it doesn't feel

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.020 
that is so true I mean it doesn't feel
like<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> year<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.760> break<00:01:03.000> down

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
like a year if I really break down

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
like a year if I really break down
everything<00:01:03.510> I've<00:01:03.690> done<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.019> feels<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
everything I've done it feels like in

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
everything I've done it feels like in
much<00:01:05.100> longer<00:01:05.580> time<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.720> year<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
much longer time because one year in the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
much longer time because one year in the
long<00:01:07.470> term<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.159> short<00:01:08.430> amount<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> time

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
long term is a very short amount of time

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
long term is a very short amount of time
and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.570> feels<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.740> longer<00:01:11.040> amount

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and it feels like a much longer amount

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
and it feels like a much longer amount
of<00:01:11.460> time<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.270> still<00:01:12.630> remember<00:01:12.960> making<00:01:13.290> my

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of time and I still remember making my

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
of time and I still remember making my
first<00:01:13.740> video<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.310> remember<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.150> video<00:01:15.390> took

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
first video I remember that video took

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
first video I remember that video took
the<00:01:16.229> longest<00:01:16.500> amount<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.009> time<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.340> make

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the longest amount of time to make

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
the longest amount of time to make
compared<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> any<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.630> other<00:01:18.780> videos

compared to any of my other videos

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170 
compared to any of my other videos

then rehearsing that script and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
then rehearsing that script and
recording<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> audio<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> entire<00:01:26.220> day
