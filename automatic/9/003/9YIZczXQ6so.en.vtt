00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Speak, I'm training the channel. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm here to send the first video of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
 channel and how to improve your vision 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.309
 game in the game league of legends 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.099
 So the first step was a lot of people. 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.049
 so speak the stand of buying age 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.660
 mainly in health but this now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.300
 that the sport can only buy three 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 guardians an upgrade so the vacancies are 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 very important in the game because of her 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 vision and protect you against 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 gangs 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.080
 It is very important that you do not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 being beaten or not always keeping 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 all approach lenses will also go 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 provide several benefits not only 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 for the game but for his own team 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.780
 and it will not only help the sim in your 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 own region but as your team 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.250
 whole will see where the position of the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 enemy game he can go up in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 thing and such this here is something that I 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.090
 I would like to discuss it because I really like it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 a lot of people are missing this if you 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.449
 let's say you're in the top line you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 're losing 0/3 da silva does the damage 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.040
 then it is very important if you 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.409
 stay at 4 in the tower make amateur and not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.659
 Giving you the catch in the face of the amateur. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.460
 defense or in the car and not giving other 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.860
 thing you do not save your flash 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.479
 others are your suit you win 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 You'll be giving goldini to the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 enemy and he will take advantage of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.659
 minions and own goal from our front 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.549
 do not die for the inhibitor 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 this is also a very simple thing 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.290
 But I see a lot of burying, let's say your 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 inhibitors table you are your team in which 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
 Is not dead but only you have what? 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.790
 Do you defend him or leave you? 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.680
 take along 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.049
 the answer is practically simple you 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 lets take because soon 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.680
 he is coming back and you 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 the hair his team when he is born him 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 will do a thesis 5 x 4 really will 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
 lose you go there alone you will 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 to die anyway he did not take the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 inhibitor anyway, so you do not have 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.619
 reason for you to defend if he goes 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 back to the same notion of robotic I know if it 's a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.960
 important thing but little takes the person 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.759
 account of having a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 what skill your enemy can 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.680
 Use on you and what skill does he have? 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.649
 and we will contact you are against 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.959
 sadness in the law however it is a is to be 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.330
 that he can escape very easily and with 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.319
 Who kissed benches and I dropped the rocket? 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.870
 more or less 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.999
 second aid not detecting powers 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.040
 so much do you see she used it in the next 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.319
 18 seconds you will be able to give a 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.719
 kiss good and she'll have to close or 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 ends up in death this is also 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.650
 very important in the midi to know 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.560
 when your enemy has useful or even 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.239
 own flash nerds so if you have to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.189
 of buttons and care 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.170
 enemies will help you a lot more 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.370
 to have a sense in yourself then that's it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.049
