right<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.700> something<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.150> don't<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.330> it's

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
right to do something I don't know it's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
right to do something I don't know it's
just<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.720> punk<00:04:43.960> rock<00:04:44.230> kind<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.650> purplish

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
just like a punk rock kind of purplish

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.920 
just like a punk rock kind of purplish
neon<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.710> more<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:47.950> neon<00:04:48.310> purple<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.930> don't

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
neon and more like neon purple I don't

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.230 
neon and more like neon purple I don't
know<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.980> that's<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.520> purple<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.000> bottom

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
know and that's the purple at the bottom

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.810 
know and that's the purple at the bottom
so<00:04:52.270> those<00:04:52.570> are<00:04:52.660> all<00:04:52.690> four<00:04:53.440> colors<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.130> these
