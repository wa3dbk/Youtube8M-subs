but<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> oldest<00:03:17.980> dock<00:03:18.460> you<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.700> find<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
but the oldest dock you can find the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.930 
but the oldest dock you can find the
most<00:03:19.300> decrepid<00:03:19.900> beat-up<00:03:20.230> dock<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.940> can

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
most decrepid beat-up dock like this can

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.120 
most decrepid beat-up dock like this can
hold<00:03:22.120> fish<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.680> that's<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
water closest to the water the better

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.170 
water closest to the water the better
but<00:03:26.080> these<00:03:26.890> platform<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.550> poles<00:03:27.790> they<00:03:28.000> like

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
but these platform the poles they like

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.480 
but these platform the poles they like
them<00:03:28.450> too<00:03:28.600> because<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:30.070> know<00:03:30.100> kind<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.400> like

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
the whole bridge situation you just kind

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.230 
the whole bridge situation you just kind
of<00:03:32.980> dissect<00:03:33.160> where<00:03:33.730> they're<00:03:33.880> at<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.180> the
