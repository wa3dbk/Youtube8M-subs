00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
set to be released in early 2015 but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.860 
set to be released in early 2015 but
what<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.760> might<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.090> surprising<00:00:39.510> which

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
what I think might be surprising which

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 
what I think might be surprising which
is<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.200> theory<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.100> they've<00:00:41.430> been

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is my theory is that they've been

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.630 
is my theory is that they've been
developing<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.390> DLC<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.770> while<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
developing this DLC for a while now and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.130 
developing this DLC for a while now and
they're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> release<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
they're going to release it in this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
they're going to release it in this
timeframe<00:00:46.440> probably<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> few<00:00:47.370> months<00:00:47.700> time

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
timeframe probably in a few months time

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
timeframe probably in a few months time
a<00:00:48.420> sixth<00:00:49.020> ELC<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:50.190> sense

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
a sixth ELC would also make sense

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
a sixth ELC would also make sense
because<00:00:50.910> due<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> rocky<00:00:51.989> start<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
because due to the rocky start of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
because due to the rocky start of
battlefield<00:00:52.860> 4<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.309> strove<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.789> many<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
battlefield 4 which strove way many of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000 
battlefield 4 which strove way many of
fans<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> fact<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.590> battlefield

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fans and with the fact that battlefield

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
fans and with the fact that battlefield
hardline<00:00:56.550> did<00:00:56.760> end<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> getting<00:00:57.149> delayed<00:00:57.690> too

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
hardline did end up getting delayed too

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
hardline did end up getting delayed too
early<00:00:58.379> 2015<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.520> top<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.270> could

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
early 2015 and on top of that they could

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
early 2015 and on top of that they could
bring<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> dlc<00:01:01.530> free<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.399> could<00:01:02.609> get

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

maps you would like to see in
battlefield<00:01:10.979> 4<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.060> 3<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> took<00:01:12.900> me

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
battlefield 4 now as for my 3 it took me

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
battlefield 4 now as for my 3 it took me
a<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.290> time<00:01:13.560> thinking<00:01:13.830> about<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.520> I've

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a bit of time thinking about it but I've

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.249 
a bit of time thinking about it but I've
come<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.299> three<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
come up with three that I think of the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.429 
come up with three that I think of the
best<00:01:16.470> first<00:01:17.250> CN<00:01:17.880> crossing<00:01:18.450> second<00:01:19.020> Grand

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
best first CN crossing second Grand

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.830 
best first CN crossing second Grand
Bazaar<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.950> third<00:01:20.250> epicenter<00:01:21.090> epicenter

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
Bazaar and third epicenter epicenter

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
Bazaar and third epicenter epicenter
being<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.290> map<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.009> aftermath<00:01:23.490> DLC<00:01:24.240> my

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
being a map of the aftermath DLC my

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.999 
being a map of the aftermath DLC my
thinking<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:25.830> more

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
thinking here is that we need more

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
thinking here is that we need more
linear<00:01:26.250> maps<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> game<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.360> bear<00:01:27.630> for

linear maps in the game now bear for

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
linear maps in the game now bear for
from<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.350> point<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.710> view<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> terrible<00:01:29.579> map

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
from my point of view had a terrible map

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
from my point of view had a terrible map
design<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.750> were<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:30.990> many<00:01:31.350> angles

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
design because there were so many angles

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
design because there were so many angles
you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.220> shot<00:01:32.460> from<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.329> many<00:01:33.450> flank

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you can be shot from so many flank

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
you can be shot from so many flank
routes<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.500> flanked<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
routes you can get flanked by that it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
routes you can get flanked by that it
kills<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> map<00:01:36.240> flow<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.229> ends<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.530> making

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
kills the map flow and it ends up making

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
kills the map flow and it ends up making

the batch of cluster the great thing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
battlefield 4 because there are so many

different<00:02:04.710> routes<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.490> getting<00:02:05.670> shot

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
different routes you're getting shot

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
different routes you're getting shot
from<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.210> top<00:02:06.450> down<00:02:06.990> below<00:02:07.409> under<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> map

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
from up top down below under the map

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
from up top down below under the map
around<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> map<00:02:08.729> sideways<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> think

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
around the map sideways so I think

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.960 
around the map sideways so I think
simple<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> better<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.849> would<00:02:11.940> be

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
simple is better and I think it would be

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.590 
simple is better and I think it would be
a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.450 
a
in<00:02:12.630> addition<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> game<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:13.950> as<00:02:14.190> for

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
in addition to the game now as for

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.610 
in addition to the game now as for
weapons<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.150> would<00:02:15.360> only<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:15.750> sense<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.350> me

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
weapons it would only make sense to me

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.290 
weapons it would only make sense to me
that<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.220> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.490> bring<00:02:17.760> back<00:02:17.970> maps

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that if you're going to bring back maps

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.150 
that if you're going to bring back maps
from<00:02:18.480> battlefield<00:02:18.990> 3<00:02:19.290> you're<00:02:19.740> going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> have

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
from battlefield 3 you're going to have

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040 
from battlefield 3 you're going to have
weapons<00:02:20.580> from<00:02:20.760> battlefield<00:02:21.240> 3<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.840> way

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
weapons from battlefield 3 now the way

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.810 
weapons from battlefield 3 now the way
it<00:02:22.290> would<00:02:22.440> most<00:02:22.620> likely<00:02:22.950> work<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> you're

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it would most likely work is that you're

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.850 
it would most likely work is that you're
going<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.270> five<00:02:24.750> because<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:25.710> how

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to have five because that's how

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.290 
going to have five because that's how
many<00:02:26.040> we've<00:02:26.310> had<00:02:26.490> before<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> previous

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
many we've had before in the previous

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.900 
many we've had before in the previous
still<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:28.080> not<00:02:28.290> only<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.770> battlefield<00:02:29.160> 4<00:02:29.400> but

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
still see not only for battlefield 4 but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.490 
still see not only for battlefield 4 but
for<00:02:30.090> battlefield<00:02:30.450> 3<00:02:30.690> as<00:02:30.780> well<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.200> you'd<00:02:31.320> most

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
for battlefield 3 as well so you'd most

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.980 
for battlefield 3 as well so you'd most
likely<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.340> carbine<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.270> assault<00:02:33.600> rifle

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
likely get a carbine and assault rifle

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.320 
likely get a carbine and assault rifle
sniper<00:02:34.200> rifle<00:02:34.830> or<00:02:34.920> pistol<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.060> shotgun

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
sniper rifle or pistol and a shotgun

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.240 
sniper rifle or pistol and a shotgun
that's<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> way<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> normally<00:02:37.380> works<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's the way it normally works and I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.560 
that's the way it normally works and I
don't<00:02:38.490> think<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.850> going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.300> any

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
don't think it's going to be any

don't think it's going to be any

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
releasing this thing I think the only

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.280 
releasing this thing I think the only
way<00:02:53.550> they<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> only<00:02:54.990> way

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
way they can do this and the only way

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.890 
way they can do this and the only way
it'll<00:02:55.470> work<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.400> either<00:02:56.610> one<00:02:57.360> release

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it'll work is if you either one release

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710 
it'll work is if you either one release
it<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> free<00:02:58.590> DLC<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.400> number<00:03:00.060> two<00:03:00.300> at<00:03:00.510> the
