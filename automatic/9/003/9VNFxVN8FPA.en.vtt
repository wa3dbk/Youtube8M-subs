I<00:00:36.810> did<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> vlog<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> wee<00:00:38.160> while<00:00:38.340> ago<00:00:38.610> he

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I did a vlog on it a wee while ago he

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.120 
I did a vlog on it a wee while ago he
was<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.720> Thomas<00:00:40.050> motorcycle<00:00:40.680> no<00:00:40.830> fault<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
was not Thomas motorcycle no fault of

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.020 
was not Thomas motorcycle no fault of
his<00:00:41.220> own<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:46.370> suffered<00:00:47.370> quite<00:00:47.820> horrific

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
his own and suffered quite horrific

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.830 
his own and suffered quite horrific
injuries<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:51.060> problem<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.540> he<00:00:51.810> couldn't

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
injuries and the problem was he couldn't

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700 
injuries and the problem was he couldn't
get<00:00:52.140> insured<00:00:52.440> who's<00:00:52.740> diabetic

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.480 

and<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.650> or<00:00:58.650> maybe<00:00:58.950> he<00:00:59.160> couldn't<00:00:59.340> afford

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
and so this or maybe he couldn't afford

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.070 
and so this or maybe he couldn't afford
to<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.940> insured<00:01:00.240> perhaps<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> answer

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
to get insured perhaps that's the answer

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.590 
to get insured perhaps that's the answer
