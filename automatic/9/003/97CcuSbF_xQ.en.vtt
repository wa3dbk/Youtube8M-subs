00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I've hit down if we look at the divot

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
I've hit down if we look at the divot
where<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:15.960> divots<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.920> going

the<00:01:55.380> left<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:58.200> hit<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> straight

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
shot my dipper has to be going a

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
shot my dipper has to be going a
fraction<00:02:04.049> left<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.619> talking<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.340> two

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
fraction left and I'm talking like two

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
fraction left and I'm talking like two
degrees<00:02:06.659> left<00:02:07.020> three<00:02:07.290> degrees<00:02:07.619> they're<00:02:07.770> not

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
degrees left three degrees they're not

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
degrees left three degrees they're not
massive<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.300> enough<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
massive but it's enough I just do

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.240 
massive but it's enough I just do
another<00:02:10.590> one

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.500 

so<00:02:15.250> I've<00:02:15.310> moved<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.580> ball<00:02:15.760> forwards<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so I've moved the ball forwards just to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
so I've moved the ball forwards just to
try<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:16.960> reference<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.560> first<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
try and not reference the first of it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.140 
try and not reference the first of it
they're<00:02:18.310> still<00:02:19.300> another<00:02:19.570> one<00:02:23.910> okay<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> mean

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
they're still another one okay I mean

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.880 
they're still another one okay I mean
that<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> sweet<00:02:25.900> strike<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.350> can't<00:02:26.620> hit<00:02:26.740> that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that is a sweet strike I can't hit that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
that is a sweet strike I can't hit that
any<00:02:27.070> better<00:02:27.310> again<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.910> look<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.180> my<00:02:28.300> dipper

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
any better again if we look at my dipper

that dipper is not going straight that
dipper<00:02:32.200> again<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.490> left<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.630> all

that they're going too far left
obviously<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.910> take<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.330> extreme

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
obviously you can take this to extreme

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
obviously you can take this to extreme
it<00:03:02.050> can<00:03:02.440> go<00:03:02.650> too<00:03:02.710> far<00:03:03.130> left<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.550> yes<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.940> are

it can go too far left and yes you are

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
it can go too far left and yes you are
coming<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:04.570> through<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.020> across<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.440> but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
coming out through in and across it but

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.260 
coming out through in and across it but
if<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.100> want<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.340> hit<00:03:06.460> straight<00:03:06.670> shots<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:07.240> a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
medium iron on the way down where you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980 
medium iron on the way down where you
should<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.280> taking<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.670> divot<00:03:09.940> that's<00:03:10.120> four

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
should be taking a divot that's four

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.750 
should be taking a divot that's four

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
the way down I'm hitting my six time

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.500 
the way down I'm hitting my six time
which<00:03:15.550> means<00:03:15.700> I'm<00:03:15.880> going<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> take<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.240> divot

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
which means I'm going to take a divot

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.420 
which means I'm going to take a divot
after<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.990> ball<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.709> divot<00:03:18.100> should<00:03:18.310> be

going<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.750> target<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.320> two<00:03:20.500> or<00:03:20.650> three

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
going at the target to two or three

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.580 
going at the target to two or three
degrees<00:03:20.980> left<00:03:21.400> never<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.470> be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
honest if you're not really too much at

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.940 
honest if you're not really too much at
it<00:03:25.300> always<00:03:25.480> edging<00:03:26.110> more<00:03:26.290> towards<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.770> left

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
it always edging more towards the left

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040 
it always edging more towards the left
side<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:28.209> makes<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> little<00:03:28.690> clearer<00:03:28.959> of

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
side that makes it a little clearer of

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.600 
side that makes it a little clearer of
where<00:03:29.260> your<00:03:29.410> divots<00:03:29.800> should<00:03:29.980> be<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.459> gives

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
where your divots should be and gives

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.250 
where your divots should be and gives
you<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.730> bit<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.880> an<00:03:31.000> idea<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.959> what<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.230> should

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
you a bit of an idea of what you should

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.390 
you a bit of an idea of what you should
