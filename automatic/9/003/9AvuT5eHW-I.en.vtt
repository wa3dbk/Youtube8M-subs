and you're controlling it or maybe

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
and you're controlling it or maybe
you're<00:00:26.189> playing<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> game<00:00:26.519> separately<00:00:27.060> on

the TV and all those different
combinations<00:00:29.340> what's<00:00:30.060> exciting<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
combinations what's exciting is that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100 
combinations what's exciting is that
OnLive<00:00:31.669> was<00:00:32.669> designed<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> exactly<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
OnLive was designed to do exactly that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560 
OnLive was designed to do exactly that
sort<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.559> thing<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.059> part<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.450> parcel

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
sort of thing but it's part and parcel

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
sort of thing but it's part and parcel
to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.320> live<00:00:37.530> works<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:38.100> some

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to the way on live works not some

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
to the way on live works not some
special<00:00:38.760> mode<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.690> falls<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
special mode it just falls out of the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
special mode it just falls out of the
fact<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.950> cloud<00:00:41.280> gaming<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.629> play

never been done in a game before and
that<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.770> they've<00:01:38.400> made<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> high-performance

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that is they've made a high-performance

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
that is they've made a high-performance
game<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.140> couldn't<00:01:40.409> possibly<00:01:40.439> run<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
tablet be touch aware and the reason

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
tablet be touch aware and the reason
they<00:01:44.460> did<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.210> know<00:01:45.390> about

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they did that is because they know about

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.840 
they did that is because they know about
cloud<00:01:45.960> gaming<00:01:46.290> cloud<00:01:47.159> gaming<00:01:47.399> makes<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
