00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's gonna be sorting these by size how

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's gonna be sorting these by size how
do<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.709> just<00:01:58.920> pick<00:01:59.219> Kansas

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.300 

over<00:02:14.420> here<00:02:14.600> we're<00:02:14.780> stacking<00:02:15.050> books<00:02:15.980> we're

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
over here we're stacking books we're

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.150 
over here we're stacking books we're
gonna<00:02:16.400> make<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:17.090> 10<00:02:17.840> foot<00:02:18.110> wide<00:02:18.290> by<00:02:18.620> 14

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
gonna make that a 10 foot wide by 14

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.330 
gonna make that a 10 foot wide by 14
foot<00:02:19.400> tall<00:02:20.020> tower<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.290> books<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.040> right<00:02:22.220> now

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
foot tall tower of books so right now

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.430 
foot tall tower of books so right now
I'm<00:02:22.490> kind<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.790> separated<00:02:23.240> by<00:02:23.360> size<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.320> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
I'm kind of separated by size so it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.200 
I'm kind of separated by size so it's
easier<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:24.950> them<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.220> there<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.060> can

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
easier to get them on there so we can

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.520 
easier to get them on there so we can
keep<00:02:26.360> building<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.520> before<00:02:28.520> we're<00:02:29.530> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
keep building it up before we're just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.500 
keep building it up before we're just
going<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.160> finding<00:02:31.550> them<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> now<00:02:32.120> we've<00:02:32.300> got

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
going and finding them and now we've got

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.960 
going and finding them and now we've got
the<00:02:33.410> sizes<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:34.490> have<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.670> go<00:02:34.790> look

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the sizes so we don't have to go look

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
the sizes so we don't have to go look
for<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.240> certain<00:02:35.540> size<00:02:35.720> while<00:02:36.320> we're<00:02:36.470> putting

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
for a certain size while we're putting

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.640 
for a certain size while we're putting
it<00:02:37.010> together<00:02:37.160> putting<00:02:37.580> them<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> next

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
it together putting them up in the next

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.780 
it together putting them up in the next
sections<00:02:39.650> we'll<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.040> have<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.250> whole<00:02:40.580> roll

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790

and I don't really plan anything so I

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.490 
and I don't really plan anything so I
just<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.760> gotta<00:03:42.269> get<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> structure<00:03:42.989> up<00:03:43.200> first

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
just I gotta get the structure up first

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.899 
just I gotta get the structure up first
and<00:03:43.739> then<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.889> look<00:03:44.099> at<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> structure<00:03:44.760> and

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
and then I look at the structure and

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.119 
and then I look at the structure and
kind<00:03:45.689> of<00:03:45.780> decide<00:03:46.049> what<00:03:46.079> I'm<00:03:46.319> gonna<00:03:46.439> paint<00:03:46.709> I'll

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
kind of decide what I'm gonna paint I'll

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.369 
kind of decide what I'm gonna paint I'll
have<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.489> an<00:03:47.639> idea<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:48.419> not<00:03:48.599> really<00:03:48.959> until

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
have like an idea but not really until

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.129 
have like an idea but not really until
it's<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.909> and<00:03:50.909> then<00:03:51.209> I'll<00:03:51.329> usually<00:03:51.510> start<00:03:52.049> a

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
it's up and then I'll usually start a

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.319 
it's up and then I'll usually start a
little<00:03:52.290> bit<00:03:52.530> smaller<00:03:52.949> then<00:03:53.669> work<00:03:53.970> into<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
little bit smaller then work into the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.939 
little bit smaller then work into the
piece<00:03:54.510> because<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.870> obviously<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> can't

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
piece because you obviously you can't

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.849 
piece because you obviously you can't
erase<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.000> don't<00:03:57.329> use<00:03:57.870> projectors<00:03:58.650> or

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
erase and I don't use projectors or

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.969 
erase and I don't use projectors or
anything<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.989> kind<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.229> go<00:04:01.409> for<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.739> I

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
anything so I kind of just go for it I

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.129 
anything so I kind of just go for it I
swear<00:04:02.579> man<00:04:02.819> every<00:04:03.090> time<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.329> try<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.569> plan

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
swear man every time I try to plan

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.229 
swear man every time I try to plan
anything<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:04.829> it's<00:04:05.099> disastrous

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
anything it's it's disastrous

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.589 
anything it's it's disastrous
it<00:04:07.109> looks<00:04:07.290> really<00:04:07.440> stiff<00:04:08.209> but<00:04:09.209> if<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.389> just

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
it looks really stiff but if I just

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.439 
it looks really stiff but if I just
paint<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.079> tend<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.669> think<00:04:11.669> you<00:04:11.819> make<00:04:11.970> mistakes

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
paint I tend to think you make mistakes

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.399 
paint I tend to think you make mistakes
and<00:04:12.659> then<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.870> have<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.079> work<00:04:13.229> off<00:04:13.379> your

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
and then you have to work off your

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.129 
and then you have to work off your
mistake<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.280> becomes<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.329> lot<00:04:15.510> more

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
mistake and it becomes a lot more

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.849 
mistake and it becomes a lot more
that<00:04:16.439> way<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.999> think<00:04:17.999> a<00:04:18.090> lot<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.419> people<00:04:18.859> take

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
that way I think a lot of people take

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
that way I think a lot of people take
books<00:04:20.189> really<00:04:20.430> seriously<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.539> they<00:04:22.349> they

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
books really seriously and they they

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.970 
books really seriously and they they
think<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.249> I'm<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.669> destroying<00:04:24.650> new<00:04:25.650> books

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980
