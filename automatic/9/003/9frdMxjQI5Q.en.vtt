00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.459
 good evening who is she simply 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.010
 exhibitor of the pizzeria 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.650
 gabanelli has therefore a pizza maker we have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.200
 today for three generations 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.210
 wow and tell us since you are 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.850
 at all but from there his brother thing of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 he and his father even before them 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 and therefore follows in the center area 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.940
 of ship between capuana door and fork 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.710
 historical try 70 of the theater why 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.460
 all his 50 years of career 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 pizza I complimented to do it I followed 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 for about fifteen years as well 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.280
 pizzaiolo to those who violate the pizzicato not 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 never finish 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 among the cities twenty years ago I decided 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.609
 to put on this really you don't work 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.989
 very much also with the INPS and the post office 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.289
 story close to who you are for each of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 their 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 yes we say in the area even if not 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.069
 it seems somewhat actuated let's say more 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.129
 offices and for every institution that surrounds us 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:02.760
 there is a pizza that is more successful than 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.920
 a tall guy for example was close 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.049
 the loreto mare hospital go on 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 of our cool fresh units good 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.830
 this is enough for that example lin 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 these go crazy for our level 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.030
 with endives when they call that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 want domicile and orders are 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.360
 10 12 advance always equal defect 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.789
 themselves are not called napoletanagas 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 another pizza symbol of the company 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.190
 our pizza sausage and broccoli 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.229
 that is as a colleague who then sausage i 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.420
 hair that cooks mom that is why 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.179
 this is a trattoria now by 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 historic trattoria tradition more than 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.770
 four generations indeed karma in the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 most beautiful house woman for this hundred 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 years of local is the pizzeria restaurant 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 including 1820 opened the first winery 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 my great-grandmother in the borough of borough 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.759
 sant'antonio abbot 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.100
 from there he had all his 4 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 life so that he had the only neighborhood 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 and come closer and houses first 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.360
 you talked about dents and tanning yes 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.250
 because adriano where I've always worked 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.910
 the monthly unit echoed the look 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.460
 after this they always work from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 two pizza makers seem to have what two 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.330
 never because it is possible to bargain hundreds 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 of lace only one person who ran a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.190
 marker who laid the px 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.930
 it reaches two and what you look at 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 vanoni various ingredients and then there is in the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.900
 form and therefore was a kind of 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.209
 unique assembly line an e 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.209
 functional kitchen and they were done so a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.790
 rhythm and released then you feel too 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.270
 recognizes that the baker is a big one 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.770
 essential role I can give you to do 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.690
 the picture of the average joyfulness of that 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.880
 nardÃ² da vinci that spa one 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 incapable person and fails to whom 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.430
 there was how I would like it to end it 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.489
 result you see the customer remains 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.860
 satisfied indeed spoke to us of the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.959
 crust of your filling that is born 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 that white level was born however from 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.510
 others not having an oven with flames 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.400
 high because always having to do i 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.680
 lace and there are not but calm 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.320
 flames but for some months he was asking us for a 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.130
 stuffed in white we put ourselves in a 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.200
 veil of pecorino romano over after 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.350
 having spread some gold under gold is 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.510
 possible to protect it 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.160
 otherwise putting only the oil there 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.220
 it would lead to burning the mind with 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.530
 a moment however, it has become 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.690
 then an essential peculiarity in the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.370
 pizza because people like everything has 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.350
 a sense that talking about this 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.840
 magnificent oven and we can not 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.000
 regardless of the certainty of master nesta 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.490
 than the master fund builder 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.670
 nesta is a family of faul dico 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.310
 structures of master bakers 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.900
 in fact samast ernesto from generations 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.730
 then there was the son of master est e 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.370
 now there are the western grandchildren 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 I tell an anecdote that during the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.790
 construction of this base of the log 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.000
 for twenty years as if it had been 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.680
 others were built yesterday 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.580
 workers do in the room doing some work 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.920
 electricians suddenly on DVD 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.350
 remaster windows said look who decides 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.019
 who has to work I have them because me 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430
 with these present I do not know that I work 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.600
 I never adequate to the laces to 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.389
 90 others happened to me this problem 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.820
 pass and I wanted which one that order 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.370
 April 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.840
 they were afraid they would copy the new one 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.850
 way to build out so when 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.670
 they have to build an oven owe us 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.800
 there must not be only one present 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.210
 no one else saw you as a job 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.070
 dovetti asks guys in the part of 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.020
 electricians self-remembering of 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.970
 leave their job in half and 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.740
 come back but they spread out I hear 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.020
 but Neapolitan like your father said 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.910
 when he told us more 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.430
 nice oral said in Italian but never 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.960
 said when your father when he finds is 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.370
 success i 'm done is your father pass by 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.680
 I do not remember precisely remains silent in 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.479
 no more colorful will not vote for you no 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.009
 because his father got angry saying 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.280
 marina this name of this in the greens 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.750
 Neapolitan is almost untranslatable 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.150
 because rightly he said he goes by 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.550
 data on direct lines good and good fabric 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:20.009
 Jade decided to fatigue and eventually 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:22.560
 send it hurt and the oven lives but me 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.090
 I can tell you it's an oven tomorrow 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.139
 to now give any kind of annoyance in 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.240
 smoke that has a minimal appeal 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.400
 heat dispersion and this is a 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.889
 point to advantage because 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.290
 we know well that to make an excellent one 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.800
 cooking the bottom must always have one 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.330
 optimal homogeneous colony almost always 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.699
 the same when we have a van there 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.160
 we are always a high dispersion 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.539
 bring us line not so much for consumption 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.139
 after doing that you fail to 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.639
 reach the ideal temperature but 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.710
 what fascinates you about pizza 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.860
 even to make you change your mind and 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.960
 let your creativity quit university 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:08.080
 that creativity in this work by 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.139
 I started to create universities 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.479
 I started the faculty without success 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.340
 chemical engineering being perido vivi e 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.690
 it did not remain would have been little crisis 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.440
 the lower room I am absolutely not 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.449
 no 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.330
 here instead in the pizza so it is like 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:29.919
 the kitchen the pizza that is to the 66 of the ideas 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:33.729
 You test the savor if you are a one 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.729
 culture can understand if they go 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.669
 matched well together a mushroom with a 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.220
 pure ham I don't know a ricotta with 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.990
 a kind of milk flower and since then 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.660
 all new pizzas are born, all tracks 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.480
 different 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.650
 I have some success on this thing 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.650
 because they tell me they are 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.470
 a precise term I do 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.030
 the particular interest did the 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.660
 with the pizza code lever 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.550
 civil 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.400
 the pizza is not about me 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.169
 happy with your passion and I ask you 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.949
 one thing never lose this 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.949
 promised enthusiasm
