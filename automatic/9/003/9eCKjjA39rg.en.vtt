all<00:00:00.420> right<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.690> figured<00:00:00.989> it's<00:00:01.140> about<00:00:01.170> time<00:00:01.319> to

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
all right I figured it's about time to

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.110 
all right I figured it's about time to
make<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.280> since<00:00:02.550> it's<00:00:02.730> pretty<00:00:03.030> much

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
make a video this since it's pretty much

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.610 
make a video this since it's pretty much
done<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.770> nexus<00:00:05.609> 7<00:00:06.170> replacement<00:00:07.170> for

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
done this is a nexus 7 replacement for

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.910 
done this is a nexus 7 replacement for
the<00:00:07.760> s2000<00:00:08.760> radio<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.410> see<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.710> fits

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920

in there very nicely no side-to-side
slop<00:00:14.639> forward<00:00:15.299> back<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.870> pat<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.500> properly

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
slop forward back if you pat it properly

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.950 
slop forward back if you pat it properly
there's<00:00:17.250> no<00:00:17.430> slop<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:17.970> either<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:20.930> have<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
magnet in the cover I drill that hole

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.540 
magnet in the cover I drill that hole
put<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> magnet<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> magnetic

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
put a magnet in there the magnetic

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
put a magnet in there the magnetic
sensor<00:00:27.119> from<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> Nexus<00:00:27.689> 7<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.380> there

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
whatever I already had it all started up

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
whatever I already had it all started up
bar<00:01:26.430> figured<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.530> so

bar figured out what was going up so
there<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> works<00:01:30.270> great<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
there there it is so it works great and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
there there it is so it works great and
from<00:01:33.180> outside<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> car<00:01:33.840> people<00:01:34.140> won't<00:01:34.439> can't

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
from outside the car people won't can't

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
from outside the car people won't can't
tell<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.820> stock<00:01:36.150> you'd<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
tell that it's not stock you'd have to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
tell that it's not stock you'd have to
know<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> car<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.890> well<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
know the car really well to know that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.830 
know the car really well to know that
you've<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.270> vent<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.630> you're

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you've got the little vent up you're

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
you've got the little vent up you're
missing<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:41.220> you'd<00:01:41.369> also<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> get

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
missing and then you'd also have to get

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
missing and then you'd also have to get
down<00:01:42.270> low<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.670> anyway<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
down low in it I don't know so anyway I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
down low in it I don't know so anyway I
don't<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> adds<00:01:46.020> any<00:01:46.320> extra<00:01:46.950> theft

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
don't think it adds any extra theft

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
don't think it adds any extra theft
factor<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.509> car<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.960> already<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.409> high

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
factor in this car it's already so high

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.840 
factor in this car it's already so high
um<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> wireless<00:01:56.219> charger

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
um the it's got a wireless charger

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.880 
um the it's got a wireless charger
behind<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> whole<00:01:58.409> thing<00:01:58.439> can

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
behind there and so the whole thing can

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.060 
behind there and so the whole thing can
lift<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> comes<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:01.070> even

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
lift up and then it comes out even

seat and all that mess so that's it and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.600 
seat and all that mess so that's it and
then<00:02:43.110> everything<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.709> goes<00:02:43.980> right<00:02:44.220> back<00:02:44.370> in

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
then everything just goes right back in

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.539 
then everything just goes right back in
there<00:02:44.819> no<00:02:45.120> problem<00:02:45.630> well<00:02:46.560> minor<00:02:46.890> difficulties

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
there no problem well minor difficulties

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.750 
there no problem well minor difficulties
but<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.150> never<00:02:48.360> take<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:50.040> then

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
but you never take this out and then

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.380 
but you never take this out and then
this<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.269> slips<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.630> back<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.290> there

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
this just slips right back up in there

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.000 
this just slips right back up in there
maybe<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.239> go

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
maybe there we go

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.380 
maybe there we go
that's<00:02:59.010> it<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.650> there<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.970> there's<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that's it so there it is and there's the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.900 
that's it so there it is and there's the
view<00:03:03.630> from<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> driver's<00:03:04.349> view<00:03:05.190> even<00:03:05.819> if

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
view from the driver's view even if

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.460 
view from the driver's view even if
you're<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.299> tall<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.110> pretty

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you're really tall I mean that's pretty

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.660 
you're really tall I mean that's pretty
tall<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.000> still<00:03:09.269> see<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:11.370> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
tall so you can still see it and then I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.199 
tall so you can still see it and then I
had<00:03:11.970> carve<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.810> tray<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.370> see<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.819> yeah

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
had carve the tray out you see that yeah

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.280 
had carve the tray out you see that yeah
right<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:17.570> otherwise<00:03:18.570> he<00:03:18.810> couldn't<00:03:18.989> get<00:03:19.140> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
right there otherwise he couldn't get to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.670 
right there otherwise he couldn't get to
the<00:03:19.380> home<00:03:19.560> button<00:03:20.010> see<00:03:20.280> stuff<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.440> well<00:03:22.440> that's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the home button see stuff so well that's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.430 
the home button see stuff so well that's
the<00:03:23.100> Nexus<00:03:23.670> 7<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.239> an<00:03:24.359> s2000<00:03:25.290> radio<00:03:26.100> slot
