if I actually bought it or if I

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.520 
if I actually bought it or if I

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
accidentally didn't buy it and it said I

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.140 
accidentally didn't buy it and it said I
did<00:05:45.770> buy<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:45.920> so<00:05:46.160> when<00:05:46.310> I<00:05:46.340> went<00:05:46.550> back<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:47.000> was

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
did buy it so when I went back on it was

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.750 
did buy it so when I went back on it was
actually<00:05:47.300> in<00:05:47.630> neck<00:05:47.930> items<00:05:48.320> which<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.520> robe<00:05:49.670> is

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
actually in neck items which the robe is

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.790 
actually in neck items which the robe is
and<00:05:49.940> neck<00:05:50.060> items<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.020> guess<00:05:51.290> I<00:05:51.410> can<00:05:51.560> kind<00:05:51.740> of

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and neck items and I guess I can kind of

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.470 
and neck items and I guess I can kind of
see<00:05:51.950> why<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:52.700> I<00:05:52.730> thought<00:05:53.030> it<00:05:53.120> was<00:05:53.210> in<00:05:53.330> body

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
see why now I thought it was in body

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.450 
see why now I thought it was in body
items<00:05:53.870> but<00:05:54.440> I<00:05:54.470> just<00:05:54.770> think<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:55.070> guys<00:05:55.190> don't

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
items but I just think you guys don't

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.680 
items but I just think you guys don't
know<00:05:55.520> it's<00:05:55.610> in<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.760> neck<00:05:55.850> items<00:05:56.150> but<00:05:56.480> this<00:05:56.600> is

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
know it's in the neck items but this is

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.300 
know it's in the neck items but this is
what<00:05:56.840> you<00:05:56.930> look<00:05:57.080> like<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.440> in<00:05:57.710> my<00:05:57.800> opinion<00:05:57.890> I

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
what you look like and in my opinion I

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.770 
what you look like and in my opinion I
think<00:05:58.340> that<00:05:58.670> looks<00:05:58.880> really<00:05:58.940> really<00:05:59.390> sick<00:05:59.690> I

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
think that looks really really sick I

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.170 
think that looks really really sick I
think<00:05:59.840> it<00:06:00.020> looks<00:06:00.140> awesome<00:06:00.790> just<00:06:01.790> the<00:06:01.880> way<00:06:02.030> the

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
think it looks awesome just the way the

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.240 
think it looks awesome just the way the
staff<00:06:02.420> glows<00:06:02.690> in<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:02.990> way<00:06:03.170> that<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:04.070> robe

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
staff glows in the way that of the robe

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.610 
staff glows in the way that of the robe
is<00:06:04.430> I<00:06:04.610> think<00:06:04.820> it's<00:06:05.090> really<00:06:05.300> awesome<00:06:05.390> now<00:06:06.350> what

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
is I think it's really awesome now what

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.140
