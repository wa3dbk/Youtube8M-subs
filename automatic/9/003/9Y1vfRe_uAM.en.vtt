someone mentioned in one of my videos um

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.960 
someone mentioned in one of my videos um
that<00:00:22.470> his<00:00:22.800> breed<00:00:23.220> might<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.970> Bombay<00:00:25.039> um<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that his breed might be Bombay um and I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
that his breed might be Bombay um and I
think<00:00:27.269> he<00:00:27.480> might<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.720> mixed<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.619> but

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
think he might be mixed with that but

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
think he might be mixed with that but
he's<00:00:29.310> definitely<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.090> case<00:00:30.359> he<00:00:30.480> doesn't
