 Welcome to my channel and today we are going 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.929

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.280
 minecraft 1.8 2014 beauty is leaving the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.660
 version today 2 September is 2014 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 We'll learn how to create a server. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 because I'm sure a lot of people 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 has difficulty feeling there does not know the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 that doing beauty will do the following if 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 I enter the brand website minecraft 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 this link will be in the description if it goes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 come here multiplayer saw and will stay 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 here you will start downloading the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.820
 from the server 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 when you download a server if you create a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.309
 paste and put it inside crack beauty 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.809
 in the passionate desktop server 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.879
 Nicole mother in here 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 the following 'you will run and will 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.950
 open normally when you open your 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 server it would create a lot of thing 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.000
 more and created the world soul the map nÃ© 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 but it's different now with this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.600
 update you go you need to do 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 the following you can see only the server 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 Then I came here in beauty and comes 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.540
 here at the end where it is fauzi and places 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.040
 trunk but before saving the show to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.049
 you when it opens here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 note the properties only have these 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.990
 two things you can then type 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 nothing to create a server 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.780
 so it's just you come here it's not there where 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 was false four save closes open 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 Okay, now we're going to fix the law. 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.140
