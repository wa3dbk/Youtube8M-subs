00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 I think he tries to assimilate certain things 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.500
 agents to identify 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.660
 to your classmates 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.809
 but I'm not, I'm very happy to be here 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.809
 and since we are here we are going to waste 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.059
 make a good match on Wednesday 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.589
 every afternoon 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.239
 to unify criteria with my colleagues 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.169
 there is not much time to train 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.759
 The most important thing is to get a good result and that we are 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.329
 three of those summoned on this list because he was going to kill us to try 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.600
 to begin 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 in later 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.700
 I will try to reverse that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.539
 try to make it the best 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.640
 the best way things i tata april 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.780
 and as that is not all 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.120
 they look for a no call, I do not think black is a good opportunity 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.460
 for 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.710
 to demonstrate and to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 so that the technician convinced us to take into account and good is what 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.869
 we look is what it is 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.760
 we are 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.110
 he did not want to enter 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.530
 already for the years that we have when we go we are going to try this section 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.370
 experience and if we are here it is because you 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.670
 montmelÃ³ then we have to try to set aside football 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.550
 this is if we play the way to play and do better in each game that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.820
 also in this control 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.160
 before colombia 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.630
 it's about doing things very well per year 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 but this must have a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 no opposition 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.410
 is the best political moment pac to oscar 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.600
 can be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.740
 let's hope york i'm fine i feel very good physically and mentally 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.090
 and hopefully yes no 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 I do not know I do not know the establishments who decides who plays and who does not and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.550
 I'm waiting for the opportunity, you have to keep working for just better and 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.920
 some details are missing but you have to keep working to 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 so that it gives the opportunity and when it is lost you have to take advantage of it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.759
 yes clear you learn from and both b players who are experienced as well as 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.829
 the gala last call 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.189
 ps it was my turn to be with the best twenty players from mexico and 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.309
 no doubt learn it and I tell you that opportunity and when you see it you have to 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:29.879
 seize it 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.679
 ask for help from google 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.479
 many years trying to return alba to the selection and for one reason or another not 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.569
 it was given right now I'm here only 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.739
 I'm enjoying it, I'm 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 I'm trying to create stockings 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.989
 the most possibilities for a future previously this 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.359
 if it happens it is enough time 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.889
 I'm going quiet because I know I worked that outfit a lot during 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.999
 five years to return 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:07.249
 nor the new decisions more inclined that were here today they bow 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.149
 I'm here 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.479
 after the incident the system simply try to take advantage 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.859
 and if you do not keep you, you have no case because 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.159
 it does not help us 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.340
 the husband that exist 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.899
 at a certain time yes 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 I think the hardest part is going to be easy to keep 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.489
 I think the important thing is to take into account 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.839
 being in 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.009
 cendoya in the calls 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.839
 if I talk about playing or not or 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:39.949
 over time the ono 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.149
 and take advantage 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.869
 the court or with your center touch 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.869
 not win anything 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.589
 a bad tournament 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.519
 messi I do not qualify 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.249
 both politicians 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.020
 very bad step of all 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.850
 titles as we make up the selection but that's not why we're going to 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:03.950
 they attend 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.060
 bonus bad streak for good and more in the selection not us 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.980
 we have to raise our faces like we did at the same time we went back to the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.039
 two clubs did not follow opportunity opportunity 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.969
 i good 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.069
 but also that we are again in the meeting 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.020
 conforming a session that wasted so much that thousands returned 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.240
 9 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.189
 what carson noticed 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.970
 well thought with that 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.710
 for you 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.129
 yes no we can not moderate 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.110
 I think 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.520
 play play as 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550
 as at that time 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.699
 I left behind that and well I have many things ahead 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.469
 I think that 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.419
 siena continuity that they give you 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.889
 at first I thought 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.020
 will do well the things pointed 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.529
 all the confidence 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.419
 i with this that nobody 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.379
 not thinking no of the pp was playing minutes and one will be taken advantage of 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.659
 process 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.080
 and I will continue doing it 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 blocks is what I needed 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.759
 it would be another question 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.039
 to be the competition of the flight always have competition 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.770
 it's a loyal fight that pique 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.490
 well teams everywhere 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.349
 I can understand it 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.549
 and for that it is necessary to work it I always speak redouble efforts 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.909
 lara 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.949
 try to do things well to search 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.199
 a place in the ownership or as always but with players all but 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.439
 forever 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:38.689
 profession of faith 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.689
 with scissors 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.779
 the minors to the competition 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.439
 the East 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.539
 target much more attention in which city healing 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.809
 the competition counts the girls the competition that the one that had you 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.999
 you say nothing to the strikers is not always enough 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.689
 that's why it's good and it's good because 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.019
 today it's about erick to keep very competitive pretreatment draw what 

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:14.949
 better so that you can win a non-position and rehearsal than nine others 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.509
 Rebeca questions that the selection has tried to drive the owner to try 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.279
 to be the one the player 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.349
 but they say that to put the goals that can conclude things to the team
