before killing blood queen Lana though

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
before killing blood queen Lana though
and<00:00:29.519> basically<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and basically to do this you have to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
and basically to do this you have to
bite<00:00:31.949> three<00:00:32.550> other<00:00:32.730> people<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bite three other people and so the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
bite three other people and so the
easiest<00:00:34.649> way<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
easiest way to do this is to get to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990 
easiest way to do this is to get to
other<00:00:36.360> people<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.250> one<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> them<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
other people and one of them is going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
other people and one of them is going to
be<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.360> class<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> battle<00:00:40.469> res<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.829> a

be a class that has a battle res like a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
be a class that has a battle res like a
shaman<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.550> druid<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> warlock<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
I preferably prefer a warlock because

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.549

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
addition to this they can just soul

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.029

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
early so just have them resurrect the
moment<00:02:45.540> before<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> option<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
moment before you have the option to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.830 
moment before you have the option to
actually<00:02:47.040> bite<00:02:47.460> them<00:02:47.670> another<00:02:48.360> reason<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
actually bite them another reason to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960 
actually bite them another reason to
have<00:02:49.140> level<00:02:49.470> 96<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.190> they<00:02:50.340> are<00:02:50.430> really

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
have level 96 because they are really

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
have level 96 because they are really
really<00:02:51.240> easy<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.780> kill<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:53.040> doing

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
really easy to kill like if you're doing

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.350 
really easy to kill like if you're doing
this<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.610> two<00:02:53.760> other<00:02:53.940> people<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.270> they're

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this with two other people in they're

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.030 
this with two other people in they're
both<00:02:54.480> level<00:02:54.750> 100<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.470> gonna<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.800> quite

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
both level 100 it's gonna be quite

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740 
both level 100 it's gonna be quite
difficult<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:56.970> they're<00:02:57.120> level<00:02:57.360> 90<00:02:57.630> it's

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
difficult but if they're level 90 it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.180 
difficult but if they're level 90 it's
going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.020> be<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> lot<00:02:58.290> easier<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.920> now

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
going to be a lot easier for you now

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.290 
going to be a lot easier for you now
there's<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.460> few<00:02:59.610> things<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.150> to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
there's a few things that you have to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.030 
there's a few things that you have to
look<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.050> first<00:03:01.290> thing<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
look out for the first thing is going to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.280 
look out for the first thing is going to
be<00:03:02.220> blood<00:03:02.670> mirror<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.180> basically<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.050> will

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
be blood mirror and basically this will

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.620 
be blood mirror and basically this will
link<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.800> damage<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.820> take<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
have two people then that other person

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.960 
have two people then that other person
is<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.010> linked<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.850> for

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
is going to be linked with you but for

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
however for the people who are level 90

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.590 
however for the people who are level 90
and<00:03:26.220> whatnot<00:03:26.550> they're<00:03:26.760> going<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.180> taking<00:03:27.510> a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.240 
and whatnot they're going to be taking a
beating<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.500> why<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.710> want<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> have

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
beating so that's why you want to have

the person with good self heals to be

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.540 
the person with good self heals to be

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
so much heroic leaping everywhere so I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.510 
so much heroic leaping everywhere so I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
can negate as much damage as humanly

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.130 
can negate as much damage as humanly
possible<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.420> warlock<00:03:42.750> does<00:03:42.959> not

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
possible so that the warlock does not

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.050 
possible so that the warlock does not
die<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.740> addition<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.430> before<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.910> can

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
die in addition to this before you can
