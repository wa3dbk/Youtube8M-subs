00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 this is a stove device 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:15.120
 here from mounted boiler snezha century then 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.310
 caps specifically to less 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.449
 the firewood woke up they burn out 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:28.199
 edit under the covers of the conservation is here 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 the main pipe which is hot she 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.920
 thick and here from 8 of these pipes 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.739
 horizontal non vertical berlin 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 talnik and tank welded from this side 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.090
 and tank welded on this side 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.969
 square rectangular would even say 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.350
 here it is visible and the bottom of the lake can be seen here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 from here such a construction allows 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 when the gap is lit enough to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.400
 you can even put a little more than 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.400
 the spell was not strong and pours it 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 tivat pipes and then pipes through 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.490
 rectangular here is cooked this is such 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.189
 the resistor goes away and goes up 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 here here the diameter gets bigger 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.680
 so that hot water even without a pump will 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 going up here is luck 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.439
 look here expansion tank which 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 should be what was at the bottom a little bit 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:50.420
 water more than a liter all collected on the coupling with 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.630
 the lock-nut and grease oil can 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 putty fix look further 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 collected here again that is possible in 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.180
 any moment to disassemble if necessary and here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 This is the grandfather 's know-how, see at an angle 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.719
 went further 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:19.780
 and here it goes to the kitchen 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:27.420
 threesome made into the kitchen and several 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:30.219
 three batteries worth it here 1 2 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.079
 you can rely on it 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:39.450
 cooking utensils to dry and 3 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:43.799
 she is tied from the boiler through the tap 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 through the boiler and went here and the pipe bottom 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.629
 right up to the stove boiler can you boiler 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.010
 faucets only regulate and all 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:03:00.569
 temperature because the kitchen is not necessary 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.519
 so hot it was so boiler 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.989
 show roll 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:11.469
 hood such a design here would be 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.560
 it would be nice to make a tank of stainless steel 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.840
 around the water was heated 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.919
 hot this pipe is hot when the boiler 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.549
 working on the first division constantly on 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.879
 even when the second city in the -35 to standing on 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.489
 second branch 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:36.819
 as she walked away from the boiler tank line hit 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:39.370
 below comes here and again below 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:44.650
 cold water rises rises 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.139
 rising at an angle this knee is done 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.750
 in order to 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.750
 plant I did not forget to be afraid not to 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.909
 prevented to open the doors and here through 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.419
 knee again enters katya cold then 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:04.989
 warmed up and see a bunch of horizontal 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:13.370
 snezha century registers which heats up 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:17.419
 and again passed through this riser 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.630
 A pack of course to do more noise diameter 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:25.760
 hot water rises under its own power 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:29.660
 without a pump although their grandfather and the pump it costs 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.290
 by wire above the wall hanging zelenenky 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.290
 such a bottom 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.979
 as 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.979
 or
