bird's eye can't really define what the
bird<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> maybe<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.829> sort<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> eagle<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.090> mean

the<00:00:43.379> feathers<00:00:43.770> look<00:00:43.980> extremely<00:00:44.610> weird<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> be

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the feathers look extremely weird to be

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
the feathers look extremely weird to be
an<00:00:45.059> eagle<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.899> not<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:47.750> anything<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.260> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
an eagle but not really anything I have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
an eagle but not really anything I have
in<00:00:49.890> particular<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.489> could<00:00:50.640> relate<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
in particular that could relate to a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.990 
in particular that could relate to a
team<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.289> player<00:00:52.530> even<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.850> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
team or even a player even and then you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
team or even a player even and then you
have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> thrones<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> background<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
have a thrones of the background as you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
have a thrones of the background as you
can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.300> let<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.320> cover

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
can see right there so let me just cover

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.459 
can see right there so let me just cover
the<00:00:58.890> obvious<00:00:59.340> stuff<00:00:59.489> first<00:01:00.260> tarantula<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the obvious stuff first tarantula I

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.920 
the obvious stuff first tarantula I
think<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.430> relates<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.149> Kevin<00:01:03.600> Durant

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
think that relates to Kevin Durant

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980 
think that relates to Kevin Durant
because<00:01:04.409> his<00:01:04.559> nickname<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:04.949> durantula<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.210> if

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
because his nickname is durantula and if

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
because his nickname is durantula and if
you<00:01:07.080> didn't<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.220> know

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you didn't know that then now you know

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
you didn't know that then now you know
because<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> extremely<00:01:10.080> long<00:01:10.290> wingspan

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because he has a extremely long wingspan

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.640 
because he has a extremely long wingspan
and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> guess<00:01:11.810> he<00:01:12.810> has<00:01:12.960> 88<00:01:13.770> arms<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.450> know

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
and I guess he has 88 arms so you know

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
and I guess he has 88 arms so you know
got<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> nickname<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.670> obviously<00:01:18.030> Derrick

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
got that nickname and obviously Derrick

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
got that nickname and obviously Derrick
Rose's<00:01:18.720> last<00:01:19.140> name<00:01:21.049> contributes<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.549> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Rose's last name contributes to the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.660 
Rose's last name contributes to the
roses<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:25.320> another<00:01:25.530> hint<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.549> have

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
roses so that's another hint you have

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
roses so that's another hint you have
the<00:01:26.790> thrones<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> background<00:01:27.900> which

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the thrones of the background which

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
the thrones of the background which
obviously<00:01:28.770> resembles<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> king<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> there's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
obviously resembles a king and there's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
obviously resembles a king and there's
only<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.740> guy<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> nickname<00:01:33.030> within

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
only one guy with the nickname within

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.550 
only one guy with the nickname within
King<00:01:34.380> James<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.100> LeBron<00:01:36.030> James<00:01:36.420> Kevin<00:01:37.140> Durant

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
King James so LeBron James Kevin Durant

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
King James so LeBron James Kevin Durant
and<00:01:37.710> Derrick<00:01:38.009> Rose<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.579> far<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.150> there's<00:01:39.780> been

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and Derrick Rose so far but there's been

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.069 
and Derrick Rose so far but there's been
some<00:01:41.040> people<00:01:41.400> contemplating<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
some people contemplating on what the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.810 
some people contemplating on what the
bird<00:01:43.259> could<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.710> maybe<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.460> mean<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> high

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
bird could be maybe can mean a high

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.770 
bird could be maybe can mean a high
flyer<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> far<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:48.090> I've<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
flyer but so far what I've got out of it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.960 
flyer but so far what I've got out of it
is<00:01:48.930> either<00:01:49.200> Blake<00:01:49.530> Griffin<00:01:50.009> or<00:01:50.189> Kobe<00:01:50.520> Bryant

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
is either Blake Griffin or Kobe Bryant

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.899 
is either Blake Griffin or Kobe Bryant
so<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.649> don't<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.829> how<00:01:52.979> exactly<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.610> relates

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
