00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.320 
hello everyone today I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.020> make<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.850> scrollview<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.120> your

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
you how to make a scrollview in your

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.990 
you how to make a scrollview in your
application<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.290> example<00:00:07.799> trophies<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.610> this

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
application for example trophies in this

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.740 
application for example trophies in this
example<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.740> gonna<00:00:11.330> use<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.540> example

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
example so I'm gonna use this example

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
example so I'm gonna use this example
and<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.620> walk<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.340> through<00:00:14.610> step<00:00:14.820> by<00:00:14.849> step

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and just walk you through step by step

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
and just walk you through step by step
because<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> took<00:00:16.260> takes<00:00:16.800> more<00:00:17.100> than<00:00:17.130> 10

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because it took takes more than 10

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.090 
because it took takes more than 10
minutes<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:19.949> it's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
minutes to do in a way because it's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
minutes to do in a way because it's
complicated<00:00:21.029> process<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.660> interface<00:00:22.080> builder

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
complicated process in interface builder

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.410 
complicated process in interface builder
so<00:00:23.010> here's<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.550> we're<00:00:23.640> gonna<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:24.029> it's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
so here's what we're gonna make it's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.540 
so here's what we're gonna make it's
just<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.930> type<00:00:25.170> thing<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.439> it'll<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
just this type thing but it'll go for a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
just this type thing but it'll go for a
more<00:00:26.820> distance<00:00:27.529> because<00:00:28.529> um<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.960> Scrolls<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
more distance because um it Scrolls I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.389 
more distance because um it Scrolls I
mean<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.769> become<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> scrollview

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
mean like this will become a scrollview

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.110 
mean like this will become a scrollview
so<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.820> Xcode<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:37.230> would<00:00:37.620> do

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
so let's go to Xcode so you would do

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.950 
so let's go to Xcode so you would do
file<00:00:39.120> new<00:00:39.660> project<00:00:40.700> or<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.090> click<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.420> xcode

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
file new project or you click on xcode

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
file new project or you click on xcode
and<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.430> file<00:00:45.329> new<00:00:45.570> project<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:47.480> then

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and you go file new project and then

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
and you go file new project and then
make<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.899> views<00:00:49.170> based<00:00:49.320> application<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
make a new views based application and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
make a new views based application and
call<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.910> scroll<00:00:51.300> view<00:00:51.590> well<00:00:52.590> we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
call it you know scroll view well we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
call it you know scroll view well we
call<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> scrollview<00:00:53.520> yeah<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
call it scrollview yeah so you do that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650 
call it scrollview yeah so you do that
and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and then you so when you don't that you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.069 
and then you so when you don't that you
get<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.579> you'd<00:00:59.579> open<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.079> scrollview

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
get this and you'd open up scrollview

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
get this and you'd open up scrollview
view<00:01:01.350> controller<00:01:01.770> dot<00:01:02.070> H<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.149> off

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
view controller dot H actually first off

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
view controller dot H actually first off
you<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> info.plist<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.820> down

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you go into the info.plist which is down

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
you go into the info.plist which is down
here<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> resources<00:01:06.869> portion<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
here in the resources portion and you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
here in the resources portion and you
find<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> initial<00:01:10.049> interface<00:01:10.380> orientation

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
find the initial interface orientation

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
find the initial interface orientation
and<00:01:11.189> make<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> landscape<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.720> how<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> do

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and make it landscape right how you do

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.429 
and make it landscape right how you do
that<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.430> plus<00:01:14.960> it'll<00:01:15.960> open<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that is you go to this plus it'll open a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.090 
that is you go to this plus it'll open a
new<00:01:17.180> well<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.930> mean<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
new well you have to do it I mean you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
new well you have to do it I mean you
open<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> plus<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.880> open<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> new<00:01:21.210> row<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
open a plus it will open a new row and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
open a plus it will open a new row and
then<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> find<00:01:22.890> initial<00:01:23.340> interface

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
then you find initial interface

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.350 
then you find initial interface
orientation<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:26.180> landscape<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
orientation and you go landscape you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
orientation and you go landscape you
know<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> understand<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> bugging

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
know you understand and now it's bugging

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.569 
know you understand and now it's bugging
up<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> me<00:01:30.210> cancel<00:01:31.140> alright<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.400> how

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
up on me cancel alright so that's how

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.620 
up on me cancel alright so that's how
you<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.780> already<00:01:33.960> did<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> then

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
you do that I already did it and then

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
you do that I already did it and then
you<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> scroll<00:01:37.320> view<00:01:37.500> view

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you go into the scroll view view

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
you go into the scroll view view
controller<00:01:38.820> dot<00:01:38.939> H<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.530> an

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
controller dot H and you make an

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.170 
controller dot H and you make an
iboutlet<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> scroll<00:01:42.899> view<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.939> then<00:01:44.939> call

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
iboutlet you I scroll view and then call

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.380 
iboutlet you I scroll view and then call
it<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.600> scroller<00:01:46.310> or<00:01:47.310> whatever<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.149> want

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it the scroller or whatever you want

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
it the scroller or whatever you want
really<00:01:48.600> doesn't<00:01:48.990> matter<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> make

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
really doesn't matter and then you make

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.880 
really doesn't matter and then you make
a<00:01:50.159> property<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.710> memory

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
a property of it so it's in memory

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.999 
a property of it so it's in memory
basically<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.170> later<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
basically and you can use it later so a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.889 
basically and you can use it later so a
property<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> exact<00:01:57.479> same<00:01:57.509> thing

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
property and you do the exact same thing

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
property and you do the exact same thing
except<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> add<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.979> property<00:01:59.579> non-atomic

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
except you add a property non-atomic

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.359 
except you add a property non-atomic
retain<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.560> you'd<00:02:01.890> open<00:02:02.189> your

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
retain all right so then you'd open your

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.020 
retain all right so then you'd open your
scroll<00:02:03.149> view<00:02:03.299> view<00:02:03.509> controller<00:02:03.899> m<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.030> then

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
scroll view view controller m and then

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
change that to landscape right like I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.140 
change that to landscape right like I
did<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:25.350> go<00:02:25.500> ahead<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.940> top

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
did and then you go ahead and at the top

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.750 
did and then you go ahead and at the top
you<00:02:27.390> synthesize<00:02:28.190> your<00:02:29.190> thing<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.640> did

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you synthesize your thing that you did

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.130 
you synthesize your thing that you did
the<00:02:29.910> property<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.450> whatever<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.780> called<00:02:30.990> it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the property so whatever you called it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.710 
the property so whatever you called it
so<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.890> synthesize<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.760> at<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> bottom

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
so you synthesize it and at the bottom

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.890 
so you synthesize it and at the bottom
you<00:02:34.200> also<00:02:34.500> deallocate<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.600> get<00:02:36.600> rid<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.750> it

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
you also deallocate so you get rid of it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.860 
you also deallocate so you get rid of it
in<00:02:37.050> memory<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:38.070> right<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.240> then<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> open<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
in memory all right so then you open the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.680 
in memory all right so then you open the
interface<00:02:40.200> builder<00:02:40.440> document<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:42.540> won't

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
interface builder document and you won't

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.180 
interface builder document and you won't
have<00:02:42.750> any<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.650> how<00:02:44.010> i<00:02:44.040> did<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.819> i

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
have any of this but how i did this is i

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.640 
have any of this but how i did this is i
dragged<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> label<00:02:47.580> from<00:02:48.180> here<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.410> was

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
dragged it a label from here so I was

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.750 
dragged it a label from here so I was
just<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.860> jogging<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> label<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.670> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
just like jogging in a label like that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.650 
just like jogging in a label like that
and<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:53.130> also<00:02:53.400> change<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.239> color<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and then you also change the color of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
and then you also change the color of
the<00:02:54.870> view<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.290> white<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.070> then<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> changes

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the view to white and then you changes

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.160 
the view to white and then you changes
it<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.880> then<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.180> drag<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.660> scrollview

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
it and then you drag in a scrollview

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.880 
it and then you drag in a scrollview
which<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.709> here<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.310> library

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
which is right here in a library

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
which is right here in a library
scrollview<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.700> drag<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.590> alright

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
scrollview you just drag it in alright

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.199 
scrollview you just drag it in alright
so<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.800> dropped<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.550> about<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:05.940> size

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
so I dropped it in it's about this size

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.210 
so I dropped it in it's about this size
right<00:03:06.330> here<00:03:06.739> doesn't<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.830> any<00:03:07.980> bigger<00:03:08.100> than

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
right here doesn't go any bigger than

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.210 
right here doesn't go any bigger than
that<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.060> mean<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:11.100> made

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that but I mean it can but I just made

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.750 
that but I mean it can but I just made
my<00:03:11.400> about<00:03:11.640> 480<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.269> then<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.830> add<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
my about 480 and then to add the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.460 
my about 480 and then to add the
trophies<00:03:15.150> these<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.690> buttons<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.380> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
trophies these are just buttons but you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.110 
trophies these are just buttons but you
can<00:03:16.650> use<00:03:16.769> anything<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.340> use<00:03:17.459> labels<00:03:17.700> so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
can use anything you can use labels so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.150 
can use anything you can use labels so
like<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.260> example<00:03:19.590> I'll<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:19.890> drag

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
like here in this example I'll just drag

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.890 
like here in this example I'll just drag
a<00:03:20.220> label<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.360> explain<00:03:21.690> what<00:03:21.810> I'm

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
a label and just to explain what I'm

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
a label and just to explain what I'm
doing<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.769> drag<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> label<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:23.910> here

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
doing so you drag a label in right here

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.870 
doing so you drag a label in right here
and<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.720> call<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.440> Mabel<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:26.519> you're<00:03:26.790> just

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
and you call it Mabel one you're just

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.250 
and you call it Mabel one you're just
going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> make<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.299> number<00:03:27.600> one<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.049> doesn't

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
going to make that number one it doesn't

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
going to make that number one it doesn't
really<00:03:28.470> matter<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.549> we're<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.150> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
really matter and then we're going to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.360 
really matter and then we're going to
cut<00:03:30.420> we're<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> duplicate<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.500> make

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
cut we're going to duplicate it and make

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.789 
cut we're going to duplicate it and make
a<00:03:32.400> number<00:03:32.760> two<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.239> here<00:03:39.170> alright<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.350> we

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
a number two over here alright but we

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.810 
a number two over here alright but we
can't<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:41.340> where<00:03:41.459> we're<00:03:41.549> going<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.790> put

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
can't see where we're going to put

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.670 
can't see where we're going to put
number<00:03:42.090> three<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.930> there's<00:03:43.110> two<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.560> do

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
number three so there's two is to do

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.670 
number three so there's two is to do
this<00:03:43.799> one<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.269> get<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.350> change

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
this one is you get this and you change

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.490 
this one is you get this and you change
its<00:03:46.890> x-coordinate<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:48.299> be<00:03:48.480> bigger<00:03:48.840> than<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
its x-coordinate to be bigger than the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.840 
its x-coordinate to be bigger than the
frame<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.310> only<00:03:50.459> 480<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.390> window<00:03:52.850> so

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
frame this is only 480 this window so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.190 
frame this is only 480 this window so
let's<00:03:54.690> make<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.160> five<00:03:56.160> twenty<00:03:56.790> seen<00:03:57.299> oh<00:03:57.570> we

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
let's make it five twenty seen oh we

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.410 
let's make it five twenty seen oh we
didn't<00:03:58.650> duplicate<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.100> yet<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.850> let's<00:04:00.060> go<00:04:00.390> back

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
didn't duplicate it yet so let's go back

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.310 
didn't duplicate it yet so let's go back
alright<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.739> duplicate<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.340> 32

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
alright so we have to duplicate the 32

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.780 
alright so we have to duplicate the 32
and<00:04:04.320> let's<00:04:04.920> line<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.130> up<00:04:05.280> with<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.489> two<00:04:05.670> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and let's line it up with the two and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.630 
and let's line it up with the two and
the<00:04:05.820> one<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.959> make<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.190> 5<00:04:08.190> 20

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the one and then then just make it 5 20

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.270 
the one and then then just make it 5 20
and<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.690> our<00:04:09.810> disappears<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.530> then<00:04:11.190> we

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
and you see our disappears and then we

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.190 
and you see our disappears and then we
can<00:04:11.400> change<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.730> three<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:12.930> we<00:04:12.959> were

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
can change it to three so now if we were

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.039 
can change it to three so now if we were
to<00:04:13.320> scroll<00:04:13.590> we<00:04:13.980> would<00:04:14.130> see<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.870> another<00:04:15.870> way

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
to scroll we would see that another way

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.690 
to scroll we would see that another way
you<00:04:16.109> could<00:04:16.289> do<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.519> do<00:04:17.579> the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you could do that is you can do the

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.259 
you could do that is you can do the
exact<00:04:17.940> same<00:04:17.970> thing<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:19.109> could<00:04:19.260> duplicate<00:04:19.560> it

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
exact same thing you could duplicate it

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.310 
exact same thing you could duplicate it
line<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:22.160> make<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.520> number

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
line it up make it the number

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.920 
line it up make it the number
crap<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.430> make<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.790> number<00:04:26.940> three<00:04:27.710> and

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
crap you make it the number three and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.060 
crap you make it the number three and
see<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.140> take<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.440> any<00:04:31.590> farther<00:04:31.740> right

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
see when you take it any farther right

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.370 
see when you take it any farther right
so<00:04:32.700> what<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.270> manual<00:04:33.690> way<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.320> to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
so what the manual way to do it is to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.720 
so what the manual way to do it is to
drag<00:04:35.010> your<00:04:35.580> scroll<00:04:36.030> view<00:04:36.540> ah<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:41.190> way<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.460> you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
drag your scroll view ah that way so you

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.210 
drag your scroll view ah that way so you
can't<00:04:41.970> see<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> other<00:04:42.300> side<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.870> and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
can't see the other side of it and

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.470 
can't see the other side of it and
here's<00:04:44.220> some<00:04:44.460> more<00:04:44.580> images<00:04:44.760> I've<00:04:45.060> added<00:04:45.240> just

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
here's some more images I've added just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.520 
here's some more images I've added just
for<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.870> safe<00:04:46.080> example<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:48.260> just<00:04:49.260> drag

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
for the safe example and then just drag

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.950 
for the safe example and then just drag
the<00:04:49.860> three<00:04:50.520> well<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.450> three<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:51.780> just

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
the three well this is the three we just

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.560 
the three well this is the three we just
made<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.320> that's<00:04:53.010> all<00:04:53.160> or<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.490> then<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.330> just

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
made so that's all or so then you just

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.630 
made so that's all or so then you just
duplicate<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.590> make<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:55.980> one<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.280> four

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
duplicate that you make this one of four

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:05.930 
duplicate that you make this one of four
and<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.880> drag<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.270> over<00:05:03.350> here<00:05:04.350> alright<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.880> you

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
and you drag it over here alright so you

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.170 
and you drag it over here alright so you
did<00:05:06.510> all<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.860> okay<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:07.920> before<00:05:08.280> we<00:05:08.700> leave<00:05:08.940> in

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
did all that okay so before we leave in

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.130 
did all that okay so before we leave in
our<00:05:09.270> face<00:05:09.450> builder<00:05:11.000> we<00:05:12.000> um<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.990> link

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
our face builder we um we have to link

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.640 
our face builder we um we have to link
up<00:05:13.290> our<00:05:13.440> scroll<00:05:13.740> view<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.420> scroller<00:05:16.350> that

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
up our scroll view to the scroller that

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.190 
up our scroll view to the scroller that
we<00:05:16.770> made<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.370> our<00:05:17.460> interface<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.870> go<00:05:19.020> from

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
we made in our interface so you go from

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.810 
we made in our interface so you go from
there<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.430> go<00:05:20.580> from<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.970> scroller<00:05:22.670> to<00:05:23.670> our

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
there you go from the scroller to our

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.030 
there you go from the scroller to our
scroll<00:05:24.210> view<00:05:24.390> so<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:25.140> set<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.620> size<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:25.920> it

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
scroll view so we can set the size of it

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.270 
scroll view so we can set the size of it
and<00:05:26.190> then<00:05:26.730> we<00:05:27.690> want<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.110> scrolling<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.980> start

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
and then we want the scrolling to start

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.770 
and then we want the scrolling to start
at<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.430> very<00:05:29.490> beginning<00:05:29.730> but<00:05:30.150> if<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.480> don't

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
at the very beginning but if you don't

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.650 
at the very beginning but if you don't
like<00:05:31.100> say<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.160> want<00:05:32.670> to<00:05:32.820> start<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.240> yellow

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
like say you want to start the yellow

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.910 
like say you want to start the yellow
trophy<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.290> put<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.500> yellow<00:05:34.650> drop<00:05:34.830> you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
trophy you just put the yellow drop you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.620 
trophy you just put the yellow drop you
in<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.040> middle<00:05:35.280> like<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.850> then<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.510> can

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
in the middle like that and then you can

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.380 
in the middle like that and then you can
scroll<00:05:36.840> either<00:05:37.050> way<00:05:37.790> but<00:05:38.790> for<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.030> purposes

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
scroll either way but for the purposes

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.180 
scroll either way but for the purposes
of<00:05:39.450> this<00:05:39.630> we're<00:05:40.110> gonna<00:05:40.170> make<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.590> started<00:05:41.130> on

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
of this we're gonna make it started on

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.110 
of this we're gonna make it started on
the<00:05:41.310> green<00:05:41.490> trophy<00:05:41.850> which<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.360> first<00:05:42.510> one

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
the green trophy which is the first one

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.050 
the green trophy which is the first one
cuz<00:05:45.120> it's<00:05:45.900> how<00:05:46.110> natural<00:05:47.010> it's<00:05:47.850> how<00:05:48.000> you

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
cuz it's how natural it's how you

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.790 
cuz it's how natural it's how you
naturally<00:05:48.630> scroll<00:05:48.930> on<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.380> skull<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.680> you

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
naturally scroll on the skull of you

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.690 
naturally scroll on the skull of you
when<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.550> first<00:05:50.700> open<00:05:51.000> one<00:05:51.090> up<00:05:51.290> and<00:05:52.700> let's

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
when you first open one up and let's

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.750 
when you first open one up and let's
change<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.270> back<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.900> 480<00:05:55.440> with<00:05:58.640> all<00:05:59.640> right

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
change this back to 480 with all right

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.100 
change this back to 480 with all right
so<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.000> got<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.210> know<00:06:00.270> how<00:06:00.390> far<00:06:00.660> they<00:06:00.870> go

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
so you got to know how far they go

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.980 
so you got to know how far they go
though<00:06:01.320> so<00:06:02.070> we<00:06:02.490> gotta<00:06:02.730> see<00:06:03.270> how<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.390> exponents

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
though so we gotta see how the exponents

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.140 
though so we gotta see how the exponents
on<00:06:04.050> this<00:06:04.170> one<00:06:04.320> or<00:06:04.440> 400<00:06:05.010> that's<00:06:05.790> where<00:06:06.030> it

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
on this one or 400 that's where it

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.460 
on this one or 400 that's where it
that's<00:06:06.510> where<00:06:06.720> this<00:06:07.040> point<00:06:08.150> crosses<00:06:09.150> here<00:06:09.470> so

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
that's where this point crosses here so

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.250 
that's where this point crosses here so
we<00:06:10.590> added<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.890> few<00:06:11.040> more<00:06:11.100> buttons<00:06:11.550> so<00:06:12.090> ours<00:06:12.720> went

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
we added a few more buttons so ours went

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.590 
we added a few more buttons so ours went
to<00:06:13.380> about<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:13.680> thousand<00:06:14.400> virtually<00:06:15.360> so<00:06:15.540> you

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
to about a thousand virtually so you

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.720 
to about a thousand virtually so you
can't<00:06:15.810> go<00:06:15.900> past<00:06:15.990> 480<00:06:16.470> but<00:06:16.770> it<00:06:17.130> went<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.430> about

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
can't go past 480 but it went to about

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.010 
can't go past 480 but it went to about
so<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.300> once<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:19.110> crosses<00:06:19.230> this<00:06:19.650> line<00:06:19.710> it

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
so you once it crosses this line it

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.960 
so you once it crosses this line it
continues<00:06:22.020> to<00:06:22.200> go<00:06:22.380> over<00:06:22.920> here<00:06:23.220> to<00:06:23.790> about<00:06:23.910> a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
continues to go over here to about a

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.450 
continues to go over here to about a
thousand<00:06:24.540> x<00:06:24.780> coordinate<00:06:25.350> so<00:06:26.130> what<00:06:26.310> we're

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
thousand x coordinate so what we're

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.340 
thousand x coordinate so what we're
going<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.640> do<00:06:26.820> is<00:06:27.360> we're<00:06:28.020> going<00:06:28.110> to<00:06:28.170> save

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
going to do is we're going to save

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.660 
going to do is we're going to save
interface<00:06:28.770> builder<00:06:29.450> quit<00:06:30.450> out<00:06:30.600> of<00:06:30.630> it<00:06:31.670> and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
interface builder quit out of it and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.480 
interface builder quit out of it and
then<00:06:32.820> in<00:06:33.030> our<00:06:33.200> you<00:06:34.200> could<00:06:34.350> totally<00:06:34.410> leg<00:06:34.830> we're

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
then in our you could totally leg we're

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.750 
then in our you could totally leg we're
going<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.669> uncomment<00:06:36.030> viewdidload<00:06:36.540> and

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
going to uncomment viewdidload and

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.060 
going to uncomment viewdidload and
right<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:40.200> square<00:06:40.590> i'm<00:06:40.740> going<00:06:40.860> to<00:06:40.920> rewrite

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
right the square i'm going to rewrite

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.930 
right the square i'm going to rewrite
this<00:06:41.310> just<00:06:41.580> for<00:06:41.730> answering<00:06:42.120> so<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:43.050> scroller

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
this just for answering so the scroller

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:54.670 
this just for answering so the scroller
dot<00:06:45.350> content<00:06:46.350> size<00:06:49.970> equals<00:06:51.500> cg<00:06:52.580> size<00:06:53.580> make<00:06:54.120> and

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
dot content size equals cg size make and

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.810 
dot content size equals cg size make and
then<00:06:55.680> you<00:06:55.800> find<00:06:56.010> the<00:06:56.130> width<00:06:56.310> of<00:06:56.430> it<00:06:56.550> which<00:06:56.700> is

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
then you find the width of it which is

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.300 
then you find the width of it which is
about<00:06:56.940> a<00:06:57.000> thousand<00:06:57.540> and<00:06:57.980> then<00:06:58.980> the<00:06:59.100> height<00:06:59.280> of

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
about a thousand and then the height of

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.060 
about a thousand and then the height of
it<00:06:59.550> which<00:06:59.700> was<00:06:59.790> about<00:07:00.470> 230<00:07:01.470> that's<00:07:01.710> how<00:07:01.830> big

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
it which was about 230 that's how big

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.890 
it which was about 230 that's how big
that's<00:07:02.400> how<00:07:02.550> tall<00:07:02.910> the<00:07:03.120> scrollview<00:07:03.390> lists<00:07:03.810> oh

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
that's how tall the scrollview lists oh

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.780 
that's how tall the scrollview lists oh
gosh<00:07:04.620> I<00:07:04.770> would<00:07:04.890> die<00:07:04.950> measurement<00:07:05.490> is<00:07:05.580> really

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
gosh I would die measurement is really

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:14.720 
gosh I would die measurement is really
fast<00:07:06.030> oh<00:07:08.090> yeah<00:07:09.090> yeah<00:07:09.300> yeah<00:07:13.220> that<00:07:14.220> measurement

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
fast oh yeah yeah yeah that measurement

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.120 
fast oh yeah yeah yeah that measurement
is<00:07:14.850> from<00:07:15.710> here<00:07:16.710> to<00:07:17.930> here<00:07:18.930> and<00:07:19.170> you<00:07:19.620> can<00:07:19.710> find<00:07:19.920> it

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
is from here to here and you can find it

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.250 
is from here to here and you can find it
by<00:07:20.700> looking<00:07:20.880> at<00:07:21.120> the<00:07:21.270> height<00:07:21.420> so<00:07:21.810> it's

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
by looking at the height so it's

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.770 
by looking at the height so it's
two-thirty<00:07:22.710> so<00:07:23.010> let's<00:07:23.940> go<00:07:24.060> back<00:07:24.300> in<00:07:24.450> here<00:07:24.570> and

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
two-thirty so let's go back in here and

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.330 
two-thirty so let's go back in here and
change<00:07:25.020> this<00:07:25.290> to<00:07:26.900> 23<00:07:27.920> get<00:07:28.920> rid<00:07:29.040> of<00:07:29.100> the<00:07:29.220> word

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
change this to 23 get rid of the word

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:38.740 
change this to 23 get rid of the word
height<00:07:31.340> do<00:07:32.340> that<00:07:32.550> save<00:07:33.060> it<00:07:34.070> and<00:07:36.830> build<00:07:37.830> and<00:07:38.010> run

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
height do that save it and build and run

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.630 
height do that save it and build and run
and<00:07:39.750> that<00:07:40.260> should<00:07:40.530> work<00:07:40.680> oh<00:07:43.130> there's<00:07:44.130> audio

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:44.640 
and that should work oh there's audio

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.980 
and that should work oh there's audio
recording<00:07:45.240> here<00:07:47.540> alright<00:07:48.540> so<00:07:48.660> here<00:07:48.840> it<00:07:48.900> is

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:48.990 
recording here alright so here it is
