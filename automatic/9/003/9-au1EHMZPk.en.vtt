00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 Leaders of the Reinickendorfer füchse received FC Spandau 06 one 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.040
 Team from the solid upper midfield 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 a special duel also took place on the goalkeeper position instead of Russell train 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 For the foxes his coup seems to be the fools for the Spandau 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.169
 guard the gate 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.390
 the foxes began to flourish 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 here with two then over right 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.109
 nice dribbling 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.050
 initially repulsed 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 again Karaduman corner 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.130
 but biker DuMont just over 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 the foxes continue in attack two ladies' double pass 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.080
 Karaduman blocked again two days 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.120
 again nothing 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.610
 continue in one direction only 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 long throw Hassan Omar l 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.380
 there radio man 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.200
 and she looks great after his goal 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 In this scene, BA injured a little later be replaced 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.810
 had to 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 the substitutes for him immediately took part in the next scene 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 2 of the 1 is there she took 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410
 nice over 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.350
 second again 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 but again blocked 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.610
 only pregnant for the first time dangerous 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 long ball Moses in between 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.670
 Schöbel 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 but so Annemarie at the last moment 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 they are already in injury time 2 minutes are displayed 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.680
 the league leaders one last time with two ladies 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 and in the middle of the Radiomann penalty 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.130
 Corrado you also often noticed that it is not on the way 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.920
 magically attracts four very clearly stopped Trochowski collected money 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.530
 the slow motion shows 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 Cardo you first on the ball 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.190
 Burcons from behind 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.250
 no discussion 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.750
 as the specialist for the standards of foxes also Qatar not from the beginning 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 there had to be another here 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 currently that does 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.160
 problem-free 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.480
 the semblance of the classic half-hour whistle was lost 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.100
 Füchse but still for a good performance forward threw in Spandau 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.619
 and almost nothing to see 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.680
 the in Offenbach again and again holes from them two then on the right 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.949
 make pressure 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.430
 at break the two were already outside to use 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 which seem to be "File X" is meters 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.969
 AFP 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.969
 with more momentum in the Spandauer but now the second half 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.159
 Right from the start you wanted the weak performance from half time one 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.319
 make you forget 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.789
 the first possibility 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.899
 Corner bile 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.329
 and Schöbel completely free 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.389
 finish with last use 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.829
 Nevertheless, even if the foxes are dangerous Karaduman 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.299
 Inches over 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.129
 However, Spandau is now much more present and also comes to own 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.219
 possibilities 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.249
 the athlete 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 still he carries the balance one on one 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.979
 Of course, he does not look good, but I had two jumps 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.149
 typical 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.149
 not yet 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.829
 the foxes a little shocked 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.529
 Ockert changed in the meantime 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.529
 his free kick was already a lingering Zils law after 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.389
 Schober, he does not look good John Omari 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.459
 the trained center-back is not a striker 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.249
 It went on in one direction only 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.209
 Karaduman Square 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.689
 Schiemann Rusch misses the ball Bienert loses sight of children 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.689
 this parade of Tina Stein in the gate 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 the tension had to accommodate Schelsky 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.229
 Bouquet Strauss and in the style of a defender in between then but the 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.059
 corner 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.099
 and suddenly the ball is in the gate 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.709
 the Spandauer the necessary luck to the game less and less minutes after the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.709
 Halftime whistle to turn 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 perplex corner ball finds its way directly into the goal 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.659
 seems guilty 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.659
 to know the rest 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.529
 the goalie then properly off the role 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.929
 catastrophic error Hertwig 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.319
 also seem to intervene 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.319
 Spandau relents 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.329
 hereby is Jena 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.740
 her new one again 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.699
 Shine after left to ever warps 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.120
 that should already have been the decision 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.490
 another decision afterwards 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.729
 Rocker then here in a duel 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.729
 Matter boss does not recognize the foul at first sight 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.970
 but Schiri whom there has seen everything red for Otter we solve it 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.699
 after Marta Chefs the skits 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.270
 Trittau Kathan 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.690
 with full intent the Spandauer in the face 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.469
 a clear place reference 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.119
 the foxes now outnumbered and behind fully open Dieter Rebel JPY 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.030
 but through 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.229
 three two one the decision 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.790
 no far-flung conclusion the foxes are beaten 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.839
 beat is also the keyword at the following 10 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.740
 there was a lot of excitement about the thread on the sidelines 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:22.009
 Mass brawl developed cause of this was a clasp and been 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.629
 his entrants are a burning cigarette in the face 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.289
 should have pressed 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.029
 the hurrying players and the few people from the order service was 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.770
 no more able to settle that 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.690
 The catch-up game hit the police a snowdrift but no choice 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.129
 as the game a little later untangle 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.999
 understandably, both coaches were not ready after the game, too 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.619
 As the only saved costs, the referee should look sporty 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:50.719
 this was not confirmed canceled 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:54.689
 it comes to scuffles between the two windows the foxes of them 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.569
 jumped 6 percent 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:57.949
 These are our big worries
