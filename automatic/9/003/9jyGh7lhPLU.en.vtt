00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
rank for the Intel pursuit okay why you

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.920 
rank for the Intel pursuit okay why you
see<00:03:44.769> 14<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.639> because<00:03:45.969> um<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.900> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
see 14 is just because um the the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.339 
see 14 is just because um the the
raccoon<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.799> pick<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.959> lets<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.079> another

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
raccoon you pick up lets you another

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.619 
raccoon you pick up lets you another
Intel<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.310> as<00:03:51.609> soon<00:03:51.879> as<00:03:51.939> you<00:03:52.060> pick<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.389> once

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
Intel but as soon as you pick it up once

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.000 
Intel but as soon as you pick it up once
you<00:03:52.870> can't<00:03:53.079> pick<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.260> up<00:03:53.409> again<00:03:53.590> for<00:03:53.739> that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
you can't pick it up again for that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.780 
you can't pick it up again for that
character<00:03:54.389> so<00:03:55.389> in<00:03:55.959> theory<00:03:56.349> there's<00:03:56.739> only<00:03:56.950> 13

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
character so in theory there's only 13

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.809 
character so in theory there's only 13
of<00:03:57.909> em<00:03:58.120> disks<00:03:58.629> there's<00:03:59.139> not<00:03:59.290> 14<00:03:59.769> 14<00:04:00.370> counts<00:04:00.730> of

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
of em disks there's not 14 14 counts of

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.640 
of em disks there's not 14 14 counts of
the<00:04:00.939> raccoon<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.629> you<00:04:01.689> only<00:04:01.870> need<00:04:01.989> 13<00:04:02.530> to

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
the raccoon so you only need 13 to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.969 
the raccoon so you only need 13 to
collect<00:04:02.969> so
