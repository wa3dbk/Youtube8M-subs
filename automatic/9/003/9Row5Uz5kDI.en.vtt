00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
then you get the performance unit filter

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.589 
then you get the performance unit filter
and<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> performance<00:00:28.080> exhaust<00:00:29.330> also<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.449> top

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and the performance exhaust also on top

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.229 
and the performance exhaust also on top
of<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.859> you'll<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.369> performance

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
of that you'll get a performance

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.200 
of that you'll get a performance
camshaft<00:00:33.989> which<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> definitely<00:00:35.670> what

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
camshaft which is definitely what

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.500 
camshaft which is definitely what

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
recommended these are high angle can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
recommended these are high angle can
Lopes<00:00:39.510> makes<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> big<00:00:40.770> difference<00:00:41.100> especially

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Lopes makes a big difference especially

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
Lopes makes a big difference especially
when<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> big<00:00:42.149> board<00:00:42.360> kit<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:43.200> all

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
stage kits but also it also comes with a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.680 
stage kits but also it also comes with a
MRP<00:00:52.579> CDI<00:00:53.579> box<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.969> magnetic<00:00:56.969> drain<00:00:57.420> plug

kit<00:00:59.120> let<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.359> talk<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
kit let me just talk about these so the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
kit let me just talk about these so the
performance<00:01:02.100> exhaust<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> like

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
performance exhaust it's kind of like

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.000 
performance exhaust it's kind of like
running<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> marathon<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.890> your

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
running a marathon with it with your

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
running a marathon with it with your
hand<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.549> mouth

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
hand over your mouth

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
hand over your mouth
once<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> pull<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.890> hand<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.250> mouth

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
once you pull your hand over your mouth

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.359 
once you pull your hand over your mouth
you're<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.700> run<00:01:09.000> further<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> faster

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
you're gonna run further and faster

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.649 
you're gonna run further and faster
that's<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> idea<00:01:11.850> when<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> intake

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that's the idea when you do the intake

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
that's the idea when you do the intake
and<00:01:12.720> exhaust<00:01:13.220> once<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.310> pull<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.610> hand<00:01:14.729> away

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and exhaust once you pull your hand away

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
and exhaust once you pull your hand away
from<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.240> mouth<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.840> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.280> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
from your mouth it's kind of like you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.649 
from your mouth it's kind of like you
know<00:01:17.369> everything's<00:01:17.790> free-flowing<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
know everything's free-flowing and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.380 
know everything's free-flowing and
that's<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> advantage<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.680> doing<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.390> intake

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that's the advantage to doing the intake

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's the advantage to doing the intake
and<00:01:21.420> exhaust<00:01:21.570> cuz<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.500> engine<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.830> basically

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and exhaust cuz your engine is basically

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.620 
and exhaust cuz your engine is basically
just<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.460> huge<00:01:23.700> air<00:01:23.880> compressor<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.509> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
just a huge air compressor and if it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
just a huge air compressor and if it's
not<00:01:24.720> sucking<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> blowing<00:01:25.470> air<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
not sucking and blowing air like it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
not sucking and blowing air like it
should<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.420> losing<00:01:27.780> performance<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
should you're losing performance so the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.179 
should you're losing performance so the
ATCC<00:01:30.240> big<00:01:30.570> board<00:01:30.810> kit<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.170> feel<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:32.009> you've

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
ATCC big board kit will feel like you've

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
ATCC big board kit will feel like you've
doubled<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> power<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
doubled the power just when you do that

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.620 
doubled the power just when you do that
by<00:01:33.840> itself<00:01:34.579> it's<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.759> double<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.240> power<00:01:36.390> on

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
by itself it's not double the power on

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.580 
by itself it's not double the power on
paper<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> sure<00:01:38.159> feels<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.500> at<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
paper but it sure feels like it at the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
paper but it sure feels like it at the
same<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
same time you do that you do that the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
same time you do that you do that the
camshaft<00:01:43.130> do<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> head<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.909> know

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
camshaft do that on the head you know

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.539 
camshaft do that on the head you know
you<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.390> install<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> head<00:01:46.320> here

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
you just install that in the head here

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
you just install that in the head here
like<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> stock<00:01:49.380> head

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like that I like to use a stock head

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.149 
like that I like to use a stock head
when<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> run<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.720> run<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.110> kits<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
when I run they run these kits it just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.959 
when I run they run these kits it just
adds<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.729> performance<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.110> remember<00:01:55.969> more

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
adds more performance but remember more

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.310 
adds more performance but remember more
performance<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> less<00:01:57.990> reliable

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
performance you have the less reliable

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
performance you have the less reliable
your<00:01:58.920> machine<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.610> because

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
your machine is going to be because

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.440 
your machine is going to be because
you're<00:02:00.090> building<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.450> hot<00:02:00.600> rod<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.969> see

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you're building a hot rod and the see

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.219 
you're building a hot rod and the see
this<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.880> performance<00:02:05.880> CDI<00:02:06.119> box<00:02:06.479> it'll

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this was a the performance CDI box it'll

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.460 
this was a the performance CDI box it'll
get<00:02:07.469> rid<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.090> rev<00:02:09.090> limiter<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
get rid of the rev limiter and also the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
get rid of the rev limiter and also the
timing<00:02:10.709> curve<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.370> change<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
timing curve will change a bit to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.840 
timing curve will change a bit to
increase<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> horsepower

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
increase the horsepower

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.850 
increase the horsepower
this<00:02:14.180> isn't<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.600> huge<00:02:15.080> huge<00:02:15.380> difference<00:02:15.560> this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
this isn't a huge huge difference this

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.770 
this isn't a huge huge difference this
is<00:02:15.920> more<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> mini<00:02:16.700> little<00:02:17.330> upgrade<00:02:17.420> that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
is more like a mini little upgrade that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.250 
is more like a mini little upgrade that
you<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:17.990> after<00:02:18.500> you've<00:02:18.590> done<00:02:18.710> everything<00:02:18.950> else

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
you do after you've done everything else

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.620 
you do after you've done everything else
and<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.410> you've<00:02:21.590> got<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.120> Uni<00:02:23.120> air<00:02:23.240> filter

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
and then you've got the Uni air filter

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.340 
and then you've got the Uni air filter
this<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.410> basic<00:02:24.910> nice<00:02:25.910> intake<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
this is just a basic nice intake so you

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.810 
this is just a basic nice intake so you
get<00:02:27.470> rid<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.770> whole<00:02:27.920> air<00:02:28.190> box<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
get rid of that whole air box on the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.560 
get rid of that whole air box on the
left<00:02:29.330> side<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.630> your<00:02:29.660> scooter<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.640> then

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
left side of your scooter and and then

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
left side of your scooter and and then
you<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.930> know<00:02:32.960> you'll<00:02:33.170> go<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.680> install

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
you you know you'll go you just install

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.070 
you you know you'll go you just install
this<00:02:34.190> right<00:02:34.430> onto<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> carburetor<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.450> can

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
this right onto the carburetor you can

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.690 
this right onto the carburetor you can
always<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.440> bigger<00:02:36.680> carburetors<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.520> stuff

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
always do bigger carburetors and stuff

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.010 
always do bigger carburetors and stuff
like<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.000> but<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.270> haven't<00:02:38.420> noticed<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.870> whole

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
like that but we haven't noticed a whole

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.480 
like that but we haven't noticed a whole
lot<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.730> improvement<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:42.490> so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
lot of improvement when you do that so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.650 
lot of improvement when you do that so
we<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.640> normally<00:02:44.120> run<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.390> stock

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
we just normally run the stock

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.590 
we just normally run the stock
carburetor<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.730> that's<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.360> would<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.570> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
carburetor and so that's that would be a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.090 
carburetor and so that's that would be a
stage<00:02:47.900> three<00:02:48.200> kit<00:02:48.440> comes<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:48.950> everything

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
stage three kit comes with everything

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.640 
stage three kit comes with everything
you<00:02:49.430> see
