00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.089 
appeared as a quick-draw game in Kirby's
Adventure<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.850> this<00:00:23.850> time<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:25.230> samurais

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

again in Kirby nightmare in dreamland
which<00:00:33.210> ironically<00:00:34.020> enough<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.800> remake<00:00:35.130> of

which ironically enough is a remake of
Kirby<00:00:35.460> Adventure<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> makes<00:00:36.270> sense<00:00:36.300> for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Kirby Adventure so it makes sense for
