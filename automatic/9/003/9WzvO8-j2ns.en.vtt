00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
settled on this this list that we have

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.030 
settled on this this list that we have
now<00:03:25.770> which<00:03:26.640> makes<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.870> number<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.560> decks<00:03:28.769> good

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
