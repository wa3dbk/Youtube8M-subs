overall I just wanted to say during this

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.940 
overall I just wanted to say during this
process<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:38.400> took<00:04:38.580> me<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:39.120> total<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.900> eight<00:04:40.230> and

process it took me a total of eight and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.820 
process it took me a total of eight and
a<00:04:40.980> half<00:04:41.010> minutes<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.850> install<00:04:42.060> from

a half minutes to install from

and getting it done to the complete so

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.770 
and getting it done to the complete so
yours<00:04:50.460> may<00:04:50.700> take<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> little<00:04:51.240> longer<00:04:51.330> because

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
yours may take a little longer because

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.150 
yours may take a little longer because
my<00:04:52.050> system<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.620> quite<00:04:53.310> fast<00:04:54.470> but<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.770> average

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
my system is a quite fast but on average

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.580 
my system is a quite fast but on average
I<00:04:56.610> will<00:04:56.790> say<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.090> takes<00:04:57.270> between<00:04:57.510> 10<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.169> 15

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
I will say it takes between 10 to 15

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.500 
I will say it takes between 10 to 15
minutes<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.010> action<00:04:59.370> installed<00:04:59.729> software<00:05:00.000> and

minutes to action installed software and

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:29.490 
minutes to action installed software and
get<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.020> updates
