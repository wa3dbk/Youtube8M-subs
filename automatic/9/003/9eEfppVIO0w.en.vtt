they really would save on to that but

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
they really would save on to that but
they<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.949> epitomize<00:00:26.519> their<00:00:27.060> archetypes<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that sort of excellence so that's why I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.709 
that sort of excellence so that's why I
strive<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:35.120> find<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> healing<00:00:36.570> these

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
by so many of them of course I sometimes

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.170 
by so many of them of course I sometimes
I<00:00:57.010> like<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.190> watch<00:00:57.400> videos<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:57.910> really<00:00:58.059> get

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
inspired sometimes I just the music

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.840 
inspired sometimes I just the music
playing<00:00:59.559> softly<00:01:00.040> in<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.400> background<00:01:00.430> while

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
playing softly in the background while

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.070 
playing softly in the background while
i'm<00:01:01.059> working<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.420> other<00:01:01.570> things<00:01:01.809> but

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
i'm working in other things but

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.410 
i'm working in other things but
nevertheless<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.309> music<00:01:03.699> reaches<00:01:04.059> through

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
nevertheless the music reaches through

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.210 
nevertheless the music reaches through
and<00:01:04.629> have<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> visual<00:01:05.170> i<00:01:05.440> think<00:01:06.010> it's<00:01:06.130> so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
and have the visual i think it's so

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.310 
and have the visual i think it's so
powerful<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:06.910> can<00:01:07.030> see<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.450> i<00:01:07.960> press<00:01:08.290> a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
powerful that you can see that i press a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.859 
powerful that you can see that i press a
note<00:01:08.560> make<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.369> makes<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.670> sound<00:01:09.880> there's<00:01:10.780> a

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
note make it makes a sound there's a

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.359 
note make it makes a sound there's a
sort<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.170> kinetic<00:01:11.470> connection<00:01:11.860> beyond<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.340> i

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
sort of kinetic connection beyond that i

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.500 
sort of kinetic connection beyond that i
know<00:01:12.460> most<00:01:12.670> people<00:01:12.970> when<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.210> listen<00:01:13.479> to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
know most people when you listen to

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.660 
know most people when you listen to
music<00:01:13.869> i<00:01:14.050> like<00:01:14.140> an<00:01:14.320> ipod<00:01:14.650> or<00:01:14.770> whatever<00:01:15.040> it's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
music i like an ipod or whatever it's

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.190 
music i like an ipod or whatever it's
got<00:01:15.790> video<00:01:16.030> capability<00:01:16.750> some<00:01:16.900> of<00:01:16.990> them<00:01:17.080> but

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
got video capability some of them but

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.270 
got video capability some of them but
you're<00:01:17.320> not<00:01:17.470> necessarily<00:01:17.800> watching<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
you're not necessarily watching the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.800 
you're not necessarily watching the
visuals<00:01:18.580> but<00:01:18.610> what<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:18.910> do<00:01:19.119> that's<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.660> life

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
visuals but what you do that's a life

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.330 
visuals but what you do that's a life
before<00:01:19.990> that's<00:01:20.350> part<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> resonance

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
before that's part of the resonance

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.130 
before that's part of the resonance
that's<00:01:21.490> part<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.880> really<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.540> cadence

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
that's part of the really the cadence

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.760 
that's part of the really the cadence
that<00:01:24.840> transcends<00:01:25.840> just<00:01:26.200> hearing<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.649> music

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
that transcends just hearing the music

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.070 
that transcends just hearing the music
and<00:01:27.270> connecting<00:01:28.270> there's<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.509> sort<00:01:28.660> of<00:01:28.720> report

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
and connecting there's a sort of report

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.230 
and connecting there's a sort of report
especially<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.890> it's<00:01:30.100> an<00:01:30.220> intimate<00:01:30.640> audience

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
especially if it's an intimate audience

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.359 
especially if it's an intimate audience
and<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.750> can<00:01:31.899> really<00:01:32.050> see<00:01:32.380> what<00:01:32.890> what<00:01:33.190> they're

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
and you can really see what what they're

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.820 
and you can really see what what they're
doing<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.880> knife<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.690> feel<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:37.830> blessing

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
doing a knife I feel this is a blessing

00:01:38.830 --> 00:02:09.870 
doing a knife I feel this is a blessing
of<00:01:39.160> humanity<00:01:39.820> as<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.119> were

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.000 

it's<00:02:10.390> nothing<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:10.930> geology<00:02:11.170> but<00:02:11.620> basic

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
it's nothing like geology but basic

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's nothing like geology but basic
chords<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.490> throw<00:02:12.760> them<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.090> see<00:02:14.050> that's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
chords but throw them in see that's

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.320 
chords but throw them in see that's
basically<00:02:14.710> team<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.670> earth<00:02:15.850> am<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.030> told<00:02:16.240> him

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
basically team on earth am I told him

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.750 
basically team on earth am I told him
yeah<00:02:17.110> sure

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.640 

to<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.689> molds

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.259
