00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.630 
idea when you're disassembling your
carburetor<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.180> debris<00:01:52.070> sand<00:01:53.070> salt

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
carburetor look for any debris sand salt

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
carburetor look for any debris sand salt
silt<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.960> find<00:01:55.229> any<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> know

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
silt if you find any then you know

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
silt if you find any then you know
you're<00:01:56.280> onto<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> next<00:01:57.750> thing<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you're onto something the next thing we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.289

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
have to remove is our Inlet seat

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.780 
have to remove is our Inlet seat
we<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.530> removing<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.159> small<00:02:02.460> screw

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
we do that by removing this small screw

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.150 
we do that by removing this small screw
here

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
here

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.859

here<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.150> unscrew<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:27.740> then<00:02:28.740> we

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
here and just unscrew that then we

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.390 
here and just unscrew that then we
unscrew<00:02:29.370> our<00:02:29.610> low<00:02:30.300> speed<00:02:30.600> jet<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:32.040> next<00:02:32.280> thing

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
unscrew our low speed jet the next thing

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.280 
unscrew our low speed jet the next thing
we<00:02:32.520> have<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> remove<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.330> our<00:02:33.690> low<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.170> high

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
we have to remove is our low and high

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.340 
we have to remove is our low and high
speed<00:02:34.620> screws<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.080> think<00:02:37.200> about

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
speed screws now you have to think about

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.620 
speed screws now you have to think about
cleaning<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.070> there's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.820> couple<00:02:39.030> ways<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.450> can

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
cleaning it there's a couple ways we can

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.170 
cleaning it there's a couple ways we can
clean<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.530> could<00:02:40.709> dip<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.730> acid

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
clean this we could dip this in an acid

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
clean this we could dip this in an acid
bath<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.900> would<00:02:43.110> ruin<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> paint<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
bath but that would ruin the paint and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.250 
bath but that would ruin the paint and
maybe<00:02:44.640> some<00:02:44.880> plastic<00:02:45.360> bushings<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.110> on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
maybe some plastic bushings that are on

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
maybe some plastic bushings that are on
the<00:02:46.440> bottle<00:02:46.830> shaft<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> such<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:48.240> we<00:02:48.300> could

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the bottle shaft and such but we could

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990 
the bottle shaft and such but we could
use<00:02:48.660> an<00:02:49.110> aerosol<00:02:49.650> Carver<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.430> cleaner<00:02:50.700> when

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
use an aerosol Carver to cleaner when

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
use an aerosol Carver to cleaner when
you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.240> spray<00:02:51.570> through<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> Jets<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> all

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you can spray through the Jets and all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
you can spray through the Jets and all
your<00:02:52.709> passageways<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.640> clear<00:02:54.270> off<00:02:54.420> any

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
your passageways and clear off any

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.540 
your passageways and clear off any
debris<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.410> want<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> make<00:02:56.130> sure<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
debris you want to make sure that you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.730 
debris you want to make sure that you
have<00:02:56.790> safety<00:02:57.060> glasses<00:02:57.360> when<00:02:58.140> performing<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
have safety glasses when performing this

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.820 
have safety glasses when performing this
procedure<00:02:59.959> next<00:03:00.959> thing<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.200> need<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.560> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
procedure next thing we need to do is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.860 
procedure next thing we need to do is
inspect<00:03:02.310> some<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.850> critical<00:03:03.270> parts<00:03:03.630> in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
inspect some of the critical parts in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.010 
inspect some of the critical parts in
our<00:03:04.020> harbor<00:03:04.940> here<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.090> our<00:03:06.270> inland<00:03:06.690> needle

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
our harbor here is our inland needle

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.840 
our harbor here is our inland needle
it's<00:03:07.440> very<00:03:07.740> important<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.430> our<00:03:08.459> inline

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
it's very important that our inline

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.840 
it's very important that our inline
