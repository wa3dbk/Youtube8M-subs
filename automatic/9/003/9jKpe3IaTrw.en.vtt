work on an instrument or a specific way
of<00:01:50.200> using<00:01:50.530> tubing<00:01:51.250> allows<00:01:52.000> us<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.450> have<00:01:52.630> lots

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
of using tubing allows us to have lots

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.719 
of using tubing allows us to have lots
of<00:01:53.440> different<00:01:53.500> kinds<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.250> brass<00:01:54.460> instruments

that come up all of this sort of
mechanical<00:02:01.930> genius<00:02:02.700> arrives<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> time

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
mechanical genius arrives at the time

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.740 
mechanical genius arrives at the time
where<00:02:05.070> composers<00:02:06.070> have<00:02:06.250> learned<00:02:06.750> perfectly

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
where composers have learned perfectly

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.990 
where composers have learned perfectly
how<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.470> write<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.100> blend<00:02:09.579> for<00:02:09.850> these

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
how to write and blend for these

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350 
how to write and blend for these

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.350 

and<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.620> something<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.120> we've<00:02:17.120> become

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and this is something that we've become

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.630 
and this is something that we've become
accustomed<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:18.710> having<00:02:18.890> all<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.370> these

different sounds and now we're making

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
different sounds and now we're making
them<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.890> new<00:02:22.490> ways
