things maybe you took from that you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.780 
things maybe you took from that you
competing<00:02:39.020> yourself<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:40.070> help<00:02:40.250> prepare<00:02:40.580> Sean

competing yourself to help prepare Sean
for<00:02:41.060> them<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:42.320> think<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:44.239> is<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.950> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
for them I think that it is a not like a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.440 
for them I think that it is a not like a
shorter<00:02:47.180> period<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.540> time<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:48.050> think<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
shorter period of time I think is the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.590 
shorter period of time I think is the
this<00:02:50.450> year<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.470> hard<00:02:51.800> work<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.600> the

or<00:04:05.450> senior<00:04:06.110> okay<00:04:06.260> for<00:04:06.680> her<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:07.130> know<00:04:07.250> we<00:04:07.549> have

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
or senior okay for her you know we have

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.319 
or senior okay for her you know we have
a<00:04:07.819> goal<00:04:08.329> in<00:04:08.780> which<00:04:09.049> it<00:04:09.290> was<00:04:10.060> preparing<00:04:11.060> her<00:04:11.299> for

the 2008 Olympics so this I guess this
is<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.319> one<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:17.260> steps<00:04:18.260> tone<00:04:18.620> for<00:04:19.130> her<00:04:19.280> to
