00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.349
 the cfu 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.980
 there was a real euronews there are nuclear power plants in the world and russia still 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.539
 I like her 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.689
 the first one went from 2 to 2 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.579
 we will follow 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
 the system 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.640
 so let's slow it down and that's how it will be 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.680
 I'm going to give up space 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 in the first part of the state governments 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 in the second part of the work 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
 4 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.140
 in this part 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.720
 the world is like this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 if this work 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 on Wednesday passed 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.580
 Greater there op 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.280
 smaller 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.080
 I have no idea 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 and do some more tests 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
 the fig tree 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 without this 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.359
 it started 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.289
 cr9 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.289
 it's bigger there 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.629
 ef 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.499
 This happens at the hotel on the coast. 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.499
 we'll focus on the next day way 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.809
 We'll vote twice on work. 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 but acknowledges the work 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 the change 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.659
 What do you think 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 when the cell phone rings and it's difficult 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.319
 remember that it passes 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.969
 in the first part we played 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.969
 three reservations 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.859
 in Brazil 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.709
 in the second part we played with the Brazilians 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.989
 global 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.419
 and damn it, let's focus 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.419
 we are like this 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.259
 aggressive 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.900
 these games thanks to the site 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.919
 we have differences and satyr can be useful
