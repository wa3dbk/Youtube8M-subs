 Hi everyone, we're here at the Sony booth 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.240
 who just introduced his sony 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.279
 xperia z4 tablet and taking a tour among the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.860
 various phones present there seems to 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.210
 I count sony xperia z3 and xperia z3 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.670
 compact both have android lollipop 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.770
 already installed the update is not 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.660
 still officially released though 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.210
 both phones have it then we are 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.039
 with xp z3 and you can see android 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.579
 version 50 2 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.379
 and indeed everything suggests that sony 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.379
 has finally managed to bring 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.859
 android lollipop on his last one yet 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.170
 top of the range as you see the interface 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.170
 completely in material design too 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.120
 for sony proprietary applications such as 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.610
 video music and albums that also have one 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.970
 graphics renewed obviously besides the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 cone design renewed 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.030
 in addition to the interface of the dl drawer not 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 is that there are so many differences 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.930
 compared to the stock we can see that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 the here part of the notifications is 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.980
 completely resumed then sony 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.660
 abandoned its customization is 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.930
 president however interesting function of 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.580
 modification of topless 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 which was not present is not present in 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.750
 android stop that allows you to add 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.090
 some more interesting how to ad 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.090
 example nfc roaming stamina mod 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 activation of the deactivation of the three 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.399
 minutes after another 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.859
 we tried to check others 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.069
 other aspects of turning the phone is 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.960
 realized that make the camera 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.840
 and has remained practically the same 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.090
 therefore also the discourse in the modalities 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.530
 manual etcetera absolutely etc. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.450
 similar 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.470
 the phone looks very very much 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.630
 fast see also here multitasking with 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.510
 place hostile material design on the phone 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.140
 very fast very pleasant confirmed 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.520
 obviously the excellent display could 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.050
 go back to being a phone 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.850
 absolutely interesting is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.020
 advisable 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.700
 this is all we hope of course 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.390
 the update arrives early on 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.330
 devices 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 for example all over the world hi a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.580
