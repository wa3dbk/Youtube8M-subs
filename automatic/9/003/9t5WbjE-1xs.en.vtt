put is where we take a to traditional
means<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.820> conceit<00:01:39.329> construction<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
means of conceit construction there

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
means of conceit construction there
really<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.650> only<00:01:40.680> two<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
really are only two out there and and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
really are only two out there and and
put<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.780> together<00:01:42.960> okay<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> cap

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
put them together okay so we have a cap

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
put them together okay so we have a cap

to<00:01:50.909> ski<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> those<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.290> together

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to ski and those two and put together

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
to ski and those two and put together
the<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.759> together<00:01:53.970> then

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the way that we put them together then

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
the way that we put them together then
makes<00:01:55.290> us<00:01:55.439> key<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.770> flexible<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:56.579> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
makes us key which is flexible where it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.850 
makes us key which is flexible where it
needs<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> tip<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> tail

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
needs to be at the tip of the tail

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.160 
needs to be at the tip of the tail
but<00:01:58.280> stiffer<00:01:58.700> were<00:01:58.850> East<00:01:59.090> beautifully<00:01:59.660> so<00:02:00.110> you

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
but stiffer were East beautifully so you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.690 
but stiffer were East beautifully so you
get<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.590> forgiveness<00:02:00.980> of<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> cat

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.420 
exceptionally well and in this case
we've<00:03:14.540> added<00:03:14.750> an<00:03:14.930> additional<00:03:15.230> feature<00:03:16.010> called

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
we've added an additional feature called

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.120 
we've added an additional feature called
demonic<00:03:17.000> device<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:17.989> mod<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.980> is

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
demonic device to the mod and that is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.710 
demonic device to the mod and that is
really<00:03:19.310> all<00:03:19.430> about<00:03:19.549> further<00:03:20.060> expanding<00:03:20.630> its

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
really all about further expanding its

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960 
really all about further expanding its

little bit you know they catch himself a

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.880 
little bit you know they catch himself a
situation<00:03:26.780> where<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.380> know<00:03:27.470> they're<00:03:27.650> moving

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
situation where you know they're moving

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.590 
situation where you know they're moving
faster<00:03:28.310> they<00:03:28.640> know<00:03:28.850> they've<00:03:29.060> got<00:03:29.180> something

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
faster they know they've got something

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.670 
faster they know they've got something
underneath<00:03:29.810> their<00:03:30.019> foot<00:03:30.200> which<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.470> going<00:03:30.620> to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
underneath their foot which is going to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.039 
underneath their foot which is going to
make<00:03:30.739> dead<00:03:31.070> ski<00:03:31.340> track<00:03:31.760> really<00:03:32.540> clean<00:03:32.810> really

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
make dead ski track really clean really

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.820 
make dead ski track really clean really
well<00:03:33.590> no<00:03:33.920> chatter<00:03:34.220> nice<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.900> one<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.709> the

well no chatter nice and one of the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.830 
well no chatter nice and one of the
things<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.310> most<00:03:37.370> about<00:03:37.670> k2<00:03:38.209> is<00:03:38.360> they<00:03:38.510> they

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
things I like most about k2 is they they

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.400 
things I like most about k2 is they they
truly<00:03:39.320> do<00:03:39.500> design<00:03:39.890> eat<00:03:40.190> women's<00:03:40.730> specific

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
truly do design eat women's specific

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.080 
truly do design eat women's specific
you<00:03:41.590> from<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> ground<00:03:42.220> up<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.670> mean<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.030> a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
you from the ground up I mean it's a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.570 
you from the ground up I mean it's a
women's<00:03:43.420> specific<00:03:43.480> mole<00:03:44.580> dimensions

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
women's specific mole dimensions

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.330 
women's specific mole dimensions
construction<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.350> way<00:03:47.410> down<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.620> they

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
construction all the way down to they

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.160 
construction all the way down to they
have<00:03:48.550> women<00:03:48.850> testing<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.750> designing

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
have women testing in the designing

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.080 
have women testing in the designing
those<00:03:50.440> schemes<00:03:50.710> yeah<00:03:51.340> we<00:03:51.520> can't<00:03:51.730> underscore

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
those schemes yeah we can't underscore

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.480 
those schemes yeah we can't underscore
that<00:03:52.240> really<00:03:52.660> enough<00:03:52.900> because<00:03:53.380> um<00:03:53.740> it's<00:03:54.220> still

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
that really enough because um it's still

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.020 
that really enough because um it's still
something<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.880> commonly<00:03:55.120> run<00:03:55.510> into<00:03:55.810> out<00:03:55.840> there

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
something we commonly run into out there

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.220 
something we commonly run into out there
especially<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.480> people<00:03:58.540> who<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.140> know

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
especially for people who you know

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.200 
especially for people who you know
aren't<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.770> slope<00:04:00.040> every<00:04:00.310> day<00:04:00.460> they<00:04:00.940> think

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
aren't on the slope every day they think

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.660 
aren't on the slope every day they think
that<00:04:01.270> ski<00:04:01.630> designs<00:04:02.020> are<00:04:02.920> similar<00:04:03.610> enough

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
that ski designs are similar enough

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.010 
that ski designs are similar enough
where<00:04:04.060> they<00:04:04.150> can<00:04:04.270> get<00:04:04.360> away<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.810> using

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
where they can get away with just using

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.750 
where they can get away with just using
about<00:04:05.380> you're<00:04:05.680> using<00:04:06.010> anything<00:04:06.310> out<00:04:06.580> there

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
but they need to be aware of what they

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.080 
but they need to be aware of what they
need<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.950> try<00:04:09.250> what<00:04:09.460> they<00:04:09.550> need<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.760> consider

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
need to try what they need to consider
