the<00:04:35.860> Bluetooth<00:04:36.280> headset<00:04:37.030> headset<00:04:37.360> myself

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
the Bluetooth headset headset myself

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.970 
the Bluetooth headset headset myself
guess<00:04:39.670> it's<00:04:39.820> not<00:04:39.940> really<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> headset<00:04:40.690> so

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
guess it's not really a headset so

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.590 
guess it's not really a headset so
because<00:04:41.980> it's<00:04:42.160> well<00:04:43.000> no<00:04:43.150> maybe<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:43.570> a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
because it's well no maybe it is a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.900 
because it's well no maybe it is a
headset<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.260> always<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.460> stereo

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
headset I always think of stereo

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.770 
headset I always think of stereo
Bluetooth<00:04:46.720> headsets<00:04:47.230> as<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:49.360> headset<00:04:49.750> that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
Bluetooth headsets as the headset that

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.270 
Bluetooth headsets as the headset that
plugs<00:04:50.200> into<00:04:50.410> both<00:04:50.650> ears

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
plugs into both ears

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.310 
plugs into both ears
but<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:52.420> is<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:53.260> mic<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:54.990> mic<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.230> a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
but this is a mic and a mic and a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.350 
but this is a mic and a mic and a
speaker<00:04:56.560> for<00:04:57.100> your<00:04:57.220> ear<00:04:57.400> so<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.670> guess<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.210> a

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
speaker for your ear so I guess it is a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.240 
speaker for your ear so I guess it is a
headset<00:04:59.220> but<00:05:00.220> anyway<00:05:00.520> oh<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:02.320> am<00:05:02.740> now<00:05:02.890> connected

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
multiple phones at once I believe it's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.320 
multiple phones at once I believe it's
two<00:05:38.950> Macs<00:05:39.250> but<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.550> could<00:05:39.760> be<00:05:39.880> wrong<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.240> might

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
two Macs but I could be wrong it might

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.230 
two Macs but I could be wrong it might
be<00:05:40.390> more<00:05:40.660> than<00:05:40.720> that<00:05:40.900> but<00:05:41.820> that's<00:05:42.820> another

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
be more than that but that's another

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.460 
be more than that but that's another
technology<00:05:44.020> just<00:05:44.560> like<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.980> a2dp<00:05:45.520> technology

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
technology just like the a2dp technology

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.820 

unfortunately<00:05:58.750> with<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.080> Bluetooth<00:05:59.560> which

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
unfortunately with this Bluetooth which

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.830 
unfortunately with this Bluetooth which
came<00:06:00.040> from<00:06:00.190> Verizon<00:06:00.730> it<00:06:01.270> doesn't<00:06:01.690> have

came from Verizon it doesn't have

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.230 
came from Verizon it doesn't have
multi-point<00:06:02.530> and<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:03.220> also<00:06:03.400> does<00:06:03.790> not<00:06:03.820> have

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
multi-point and it also does not have

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.510 
multi-point and it also does not have
the<00:06:04.360> a2dp<00:06:04.990> technology<00:06:07.920> so<00:06:08.920> I<00:06:08.950> can't<00:06:09.340> play

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
the a2dp technology so I can't play

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.400 
the a2dp technology so I can't play
music<00:06:09.700> with<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.240> all<00:06:10.510> I<00:06:10.540> can<00:06:10.810> do<00:06:10.960> is<00:06:11.170> answer

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
music with that all I can do is answer

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.420

or<00:06:12.730> connect<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.420> a<00:06:13.450> device<00:06:13.840> that<00:06:14.140> makes<00:06:14.740> it

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
or connect it to a device that makes it

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.910 
or connect it to a device that makes it
think<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.370> it's<00:06:15.520> constantly<00:06:16.060> streaming<00:06:16.920> for

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
think that it's constantly streaming for

think that it's constantly streaming for
a<00:06:17.950> conversation<00:06:20.760> so<00:06:21.760> like<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.120> said<00:06:22.360> it's<00:06:22.690> real

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
a conversation so like I said it's real

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.080 
a conversation so like I said it's real
simple<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.590> connect<00:06:23.860> Bluetooth<00:06:24.250> devices<00:06:24.580> once

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
simple to connect Bluetooth devices once

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.670 
simple to connect Bluetooth devices once
you<00:06:25.210> get<00:06:25.420> them<00:06:25.600> into<00:06:25.810> their<00:06:26.050> pairing<00:06:26.410> modes

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
you get them into their pairing modes

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.370 
you get them into their pairing modes
now<00:06:27.280> some<00:06:27.610> devices<00:06:27.970> don't<00:06:28.480> make<00:06:28.720> it<00:06:28.900> simple

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
now some devices don't make it simple

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.430 
now some devices don't make it simple
for<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.680> figure<00:06:30.100> out<00:06:30.280> how<00:06:30.880> to<00:06:31.170> connect<00:06:32.170> and

in pairing mode what I did was Google

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.290 
in pairing mode what I did was Google
search<00:07:06.560> it<00:07:06.800> like<00:07:07.100> I<00:07:07.220> told<00:07:07.400> you<00:07:07.520> before<00:07:07.640> Google

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
to pair what you had to do was hold down

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.640
