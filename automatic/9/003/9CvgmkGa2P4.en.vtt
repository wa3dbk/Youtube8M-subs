00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.640
 to look for a sound what I was doing 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.700
 was to put me with the speaker to the height 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.000
 from my waist 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.480
 and the sound I heard was the bass 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 this caused me to the following problem 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 I had it with a sound that for me 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.150
 taste was very good but when I moved 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.460
 from that position the sound changed 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.060
 and in concert what came to him 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.030
 public concerts soundproofing was a 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.309
 very very strident sound which 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.920
 it was light years away from what I was 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.350
 listening from my position 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.960
 in big concerts where we were going 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 analyzed the technician always told me 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.469
 that sounded too sharp 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.070
 the solution was simpler than 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.840
 I expected the trick was to look for the sound 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.450
 listening to the amplifier about two 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.610
 meters away and the area 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.550
 treble 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 contrary to what I thought when I came back 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.630
 to put myself in the normal position 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.960
 the sound was more serious than 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.659
 I listened while I touched the settings 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.570
 but it was not bad the sound was not 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.610
 everything serious that I thought it would be 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.830
 and what I've got a very sound 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.390
 good and that playing with the whole group 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.390
 be very powerful
