00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
couldn't leave a bit fussy at the moment

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.410

because like that's all they've got and
here<00:01:49.420> we<00:01:49.450> go<00:01:49.540> here<00:01:50.020> she<00:01:50.200> does<00:01:50.380> she<00:01:50.650> has<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.830> pile

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
here we go here she does she has a pile

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.800 
here we go here she does she has a pile
of<00:01:51.220> stuff<00:01:52.020> he's<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.500> go<00:01:53.770> off<00:01:54.810> anyway

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
of stuff he's going to go off anyway

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
clever is that there's a piece of

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
clever is that there's a piece of
garbage<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.030> before<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> carpet<00:02:02.020> below
