the enemy pushing on the western side of
the<00:01:17.820> map<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.330> tell<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> mini-map

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the map you can tell on the mini-map

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.249 
the map you can tell on the mini-map
they<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.420> was<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.720> concerned<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
they I was a little concerned at this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
they I was a little concerned at this
point<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.710> gonna<00:01:22.830> lie<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
point I'm not gonna lie so but at the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.240 
point I'm not gonna lie so but at the
same<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.710> they're<00:01:25.950> probably<00:01:26.100> gonna

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
same time I know they're probably gonna

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
same time I know they're probably gonna
be<00:01:26.369> playing<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.759> defensive<00:01:27.240> posture<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
be playing more defensive posture just

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
be playing more defensive posture just
by<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> number<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> td's<00:01:28.950> their<00:01:29.220> team<00:01:29.400> has<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
by the number of td's their team has and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.740 
by the number of td's their team has and
I'm<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> sniper<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
I'm going up here to be the sniper and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
I'm going up here to be the sniper and
that<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> su-85<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> speed<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that because the su-85 has the speed I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
that because the su-85 has the speed I
knew<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.909> make<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.810> ran

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
knew I can make it up here and if I ran

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
knew I can make it up here and if I ran
into<00:01:37.140> any<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> smaller<00:01:37.740> tanks<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.130> knew<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
into any the smaller tanks I knew I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.429 
into any the smaller tanks I knew I
could<00:01:38.430> probably<00:01:38.850> kill<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.570> hit<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
could probably kill them in one hit the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.100 
could probably kill them in one hit the
benefit<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> 107<00:01:41.640> again<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
benefit of the 107 again and we have a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
benefit of the 107 again and we have a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
right-click trick again to keep my

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.830 
right-click trick again to keep my
target<00:02:09.840> aimed<00:02:10.020> where<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
target aimed where I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.080 
target aimed where I
and<00:02:11.200> look<00:02:11.830> around<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.730> aware<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:12.970> my

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and look around and be aware of my

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.610 
and look around and be aware of my
surroundings<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.690> he's<00:02:14.140> pushing<00:02:14.470> through<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
surroundings so he's pushing through the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.830 
surroundings so he's pushing through the
city<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.069> he<00:02:15.340> sees<00:02:15.550> nothing<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> assume
