00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
in the break out over the level we

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.030 
in the break out over the level we
talked<00:01:56.759> about<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> 7th<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> January<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
talked about on the 7th of January and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
talked about on the 7th of January and
of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.369> we're<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.759> our<00:01:59.939> way<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.780> we

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
of course we're on our way to what we

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.130 
of course we're on our way to what we
think<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.530> 13<00:02:02.630> 4013<00:02:03.630> 20<00:02:04.049> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
think is going to be about 13 4013 20 or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.690 
think is going to be about 13 4013 20 or
so<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.530> around<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
so right around here we think the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
so right around here we think the
marketing<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> move<00:02:07.020> into<00:02:07.560> safety

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
marketing to go it's a move into safety

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.339 
marketing to go it's a move into safety
this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.700> Europeans<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.599> well

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this is something Europeans do well

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.350 
this is something Europeans do well
everyone<00:02:10.800> does<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.640> times

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
everyone does when times

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.050 
everyone does when times
our<00:02:12.650> dramatic<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.160> they<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.460> today<00:02:14.610> with<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
our dramatic like they are today with a

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
our dramatic like they are today with a
Black<00:02:15.630> Swan<00:02:15.990> event<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.650> can't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
Black Swan event this I can't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
Black Swan event this I can't
overestimate<00:02:17.640> how<00:02:18.030> important<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
overestimate how important this is to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.560 
overestimate how important this is to
all<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.200> markets<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.850> think<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.420> could

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
all the markets and I think it could

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
all the markets and I think it could
have<00:02:21.720> certainly<00:02:22.230> affect<00:02:22.650> us<00:02:23.100> markets<00:02:23.640> which

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
have certainly affect us markets which

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.340 
have certainly affect us markets which
is<00:02:23.910> sort<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.090> hanging<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.900> today<00:02:25.050> and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
is sort of hanging in there today and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
is sort of hanging in there today and
we'll<00:02:25.800> go<00:02:25.920> look<00:02:26.100> at<00:02:26.220> those<00:02:26.340> markets<00:02:26.700> right<00:02:27.420> now

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
we'll go look at those markets right now

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
we'll go look at those markets right now
well<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.350> are<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.740> Dow<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.400> as

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
well here we are this is the Dow and as

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.670 
well here we are this is the Dow and as
you<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.360> we've<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.900> some<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.260> clear

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you know we've got some very clear

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.520 
you know we've got some very clear
levels<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.160> Dow<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.700> want<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.180> say<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.380> if

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
levels on the Dow we want to say that if

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.180 
levels on the Dow we want to say that if
this<00:02:34.710> happens<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.850> dow<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.440> 17<00:02:38.180> 262<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
this happens in the dow is 17 262 if we

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
this happens in the dow is 17 262 if we
go<00:02:41.340> below<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> level<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
go below that level it's going to really

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
go below that level it's going to really
cause<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> problem<00:02:44.070> which<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.340> right<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
cause a problem which is right there so

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
cause a problem which is right there so
you<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.480> touched<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.930> yesterday<00:02:46.260> but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
you can see we touched it yesterday but

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.980 
you can see we touched it yesterday but
really<00:02:46.770> came<00:02:46.950> back<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.490> closed<00:02:48.150> way<00:02:48.660> off<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
really came back and closed way off the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.750 
really came back and closed way off the
lows<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.500> may<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.980> today<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.250> we're<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
lows we may see that today so we're in a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
lows we may see that today so we're in a
training<00:02:51.060> range<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.350> put<00:02:52.560> our<00:02:52.590> trade

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
training range and if we put our trade

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.340 
training range and if we put our trade
triangles<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.640> here<00:02:53.970> you'll<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:55.110> we're

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
triangles on here you'll see that we're

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.800 
triangles on here you'll see that we're
pretty<00:02:55.530> much<00:02:55.709> stuck<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.670> 55<00:02:57.270> trading

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
pretty much stuck in this 55 trading

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.870 
pretty much stuck in this 55 trading
range<00:02:57.989> mode<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:58.770> trading<00:02:59.100> range<00:02:59.250> mode<00:02:59.459> means

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
range mode now trading range mode means

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.580 
range mode now trading range mode means
that<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.540> not<00:03:00.780> going<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
that you're just not going to the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.080 
that you're just not going to the
markets<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> sort<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.610> anywhere

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
markets to sort of not going anywhere

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.750 
markets to sort of not going anywhere
you<00:03:03.209> can<00:03:03.330> see<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.570> like<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:05.459> need<00:03:05.610> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
you can see it like that so we need to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.750 
you can see it like that so we need to
see<00:03:06.650> we<00:03:07.650> need<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.160> change<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.610> will

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
see we need to see this change it will

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.310 
see we need to see this change it will
change<00:03:08.940> eventually<00:03:09.120> whether<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
change eventually whether it's a

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.920 
change eventually whether it's a
continuation<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> upside<00:03:11.489> or<00:03:11.930> whether

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
continuation to the upside or whether

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.810 
continuation to the upside or whether
it's<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> continuation<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.160> Dow<00:03:14.340> or<00:03:14.580> new

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
it's a continuation to the Dow or new

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.270 
it's a continuation to the Dow or new
trend<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> downside<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:16.320> now<00:03:16.530> you've

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
trend to the downside right now you've

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.949 
trend to the downside right now you've
got<00:03:17.489> both<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> triangles<00:03:18.150> positive

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
got both the triangles positive

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.160 
got both the triangles positive
indicating<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.950> trend<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> still<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:21.170> but

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
indicating the trend is still up but

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.720 
indicating the trend is still up but
however<00:03:22.380> there's<00:03:22.769> some<00:03:22.920> little<00:03:23.370> curious

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
however there's some little curious

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.270 
however there's some little curious
things<00:03:24.180> going<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.260> RSI<00:03:25.739> going<00:03:26.040> below

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
things going on like the RSI going below

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.370 
things going on like the RSI going below
50<00:03:26.730> which<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> good<00:03:27.450> sign<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
