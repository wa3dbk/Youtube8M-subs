00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
pick one of the things that we try to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
emphasize in this game was variety of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.890 
emphasize in this game was variety of
gameplay<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.180> comes<00:01:29.479> in<00:01:29.690> many<00:01:29.780> forms

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
gameplay and that comes in many forms

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.110 
gameplay and that comes in many forms
and<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.770> level<00:01:31.070> design<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.340> critical<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.090> that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
and the level design is critical to that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.550 
and the level design is critical to that
obviously<00:01:32.600> we<00:01:32.690> going<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.870> give<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> variety<00:01:33.530> of

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
obviously we going to give a variety of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.960 
obviously we going to give a variety of
weapons<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.100> planning<00:01:34.550> as<00:01:34.640> different

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
weapons and planning as different

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.880 
weapons and planning as different
characters<00:01:35.000> there's<00:01:35.869> going<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.110> be<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.500> lot<00:01:36.830> of

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
characters there's going to be a lot of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.250

very<00:01:37.280> close<00:01:37.610> quarters<00:01:38.060> combat<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
very close quarters combat and so the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.280 
very close quarters combat and so the
level<00:01:39.560> design<00:01:39.650> is<00:01:40.220> very<00:01:40.490> frenetic<00:01:41.270> very<00:01:42.050> fast

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
level design is very frenetic very fast

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.850 
level design is very frenetic very fast
