going to take my I've got it set to 200

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.940 
going to take my I've got it set to 200
and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.310> shows<00:01:09.119> zero<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.290> first<00:01:10.500> we're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and it shows zero now we're first we're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
and it shows zero now we're first we're
going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> check<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.520> top<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> bottom

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
going to check the top and the bottom

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.469 
going to check the top and the bottom

the sort of the little train tunnel
shape<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:16.979> immediately

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
shape one here and the one immediately

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
shape one here and the one immediately
just<00:01:18.210> abducts<00:01:18.840> opposed<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:21.020> put<00:01:22.020> one

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
just abducts opposed to it you put one

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
just abducts opposed to it you put one
lead<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.100> lead<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.939> it

lead in here and one lead in here and it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
lead in here and one lead in here and it
should<00:01:24.479> read<00:01:24.750> zero<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.530> means<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.860> your

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
should read zero that means that your

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.359 
should read zero that means that your
your<00:01:27.060> ground<00:01:27.840> wire<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.650> working<00:01:29.189> properly

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
your ground wire is is working properly

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.499 
your ground wire is is working properly
now<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.079> put<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.759> your<00:01:32.759> black<00:01:33.030> went<00:01:33.299> into

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
now you put your your black went into

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.289 
now you put your your black went into
this<00:01:33.689> side<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:35.340> put<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.210> with

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this side and you put the other one with

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
this side and you put the other one with
the<00:01:36.360> red<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.720> into<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> ground<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> can

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the red one into the ground and you can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
the red one into the ground and you can
check<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.780> 120<00:01:41.720> there

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
check and make sure you got 120 there

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
check and make sure you got 120 there
you<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.409> side<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.549> side<00:01:44.790> now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you go on that side that's one side now

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
you go on that side that's one side now
let's<00:01:45.420> check<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:45.930> side<00:01:46.460> make<00:01:47.460> sure

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
let's check the other side make sure

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
let's check the other side make sure
that<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.119> 120<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:50.840> all

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that we get 120 on this side as well all

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
that we get 120 on this side as well all
right<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> means<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.770> that's<00:01:52.890> working

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
right so that means that that's working

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
right so that means that that's working
correctly<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.720> happens<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.140> check

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
correctly now what happens if we check

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.219 
correctly now what happens if we check
both<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.979> these<00:01:56.100> side<00:01:56.579> poles<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.229> well

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
both of these side poles like this well

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.370 
both of these side poles like this well
let's<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.820> multimeter

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
let's see how my multimeter

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.959 
let's see how my multimeter
there's<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> opposition<00:02:02.460> when<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
