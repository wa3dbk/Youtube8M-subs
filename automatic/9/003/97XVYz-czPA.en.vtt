our work is with outside customers and
clients<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.680> our<00:01:49.860> tagline<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
clients and that you know our tagline is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
clients and that you know our tagline is
the<00:01:50.729> business<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> breakthroughs<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> lot

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the business of breakthroughs and a lot

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.210 
the business of breakthroughs and a lot
of<00:01:52.140> people<00:01:52.409> look<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.799> say<00:01:53.040> well

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of people look at that and say well

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
of people look at that and say well
that's<00:01:53.460> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> paradox<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.780> put

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that's kind of a paradox how do you put

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.940 
that's kind of a paradox how do you put
those<00:01:55.110> two<00:01:55.170> things<00:01:55.409> together<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.950> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
those two things together but I think we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
those two things together but I think we
figure<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> real

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
figure that out and it's a real

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
figure that out and it's a real
opportunity<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> kind<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
opportunity and it's the kind of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.859 
opportunity and it's the kind of
transition<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.360> community

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
transition that I see this community

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
transition that I see this community
going<00:02:04.020> through<00:02:04.320> how<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going through how do you have that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
going through how do you have that
impact<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> world<00:02:06.149> how<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> keep<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
impact in the world how do you keep that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
impact in the world how do you keep that
passion<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.310> drive<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.420> have

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
passion but really drive it out to have

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.290 
passion but really drive it out to have
a<00:02:09.750> significant<00:02:10.619> commercial<00:02:10.950> influence

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
a significant commercial influence

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.720 
a significant commercial influence
and<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.870> third<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.320> as<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.310> work<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.640> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and the third is as we work in that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.720 
and the third is as we work in that

Silicon Valley well you know it's called

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.210 
Silicon Valley well you know it's called
silicon<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:22.000> started<00:02:22.420> with<00:02:22.600> hardware

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
silicon because it started with hardware

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.980 
silicon because it started with hardware
making<00:02:24.220> things<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:25.600> still<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.960> a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
making things and we still have a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.630 
making things and we still have a

significant amount of work in that area

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.370 
significant amount of work in that area
we've<00:02:28.000> got<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> set<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> people<00:02:28.630> here<00:02:28.990> who<00:02:29.020> work

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
we've got a set of people here who work

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.880 
we've got a set of people here who work

reasoning<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.520> pretty<00:02:48.790> significant

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
reasoning we have a pretty significant

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.680 
reasoning we have a pretty significant
program<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:50.260> applying<00:02:50.740> those<00:02:51.040> technologies

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
program in applying those technologies

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.500 
program in applying those technologies
to<00:02:52.690> go<00:02:53.350> from<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.710> conceptual<00:02:54.130> design<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.480> a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to go from a conceptual design to a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.100 
to go from a conceptual design to a
manufactured<00:02:56.470> system<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.460> so<00:02:57.610> we<00:02:58.270> were<00:02:58.450> we've

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
manufactured system and so we were we've

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
manufactured system and so we were we've
got<00:02:59.320> about<00:02:59.440> 20<00:02:59.860> of<00:02:59.890> our<00:03:00.010> folks<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.880> know

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
got about 20 of our folks we you know

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.330 
got about 20 of our folks we you know
fun<00:03:01.180> angled<00:03:01.510> 20<00:03:01.750> passes<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.800> join<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
fun angled 20 passes to join in to the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.760 
fun angled 20 passes to join in to the
event<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.810> know<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> bunch<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.290> folks

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
event and and you know a bunch of folks

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.470 
event and and you know a bunch of folks
from<00:03:05.980> Park<00:03:06.250> are<00:03:06.400> going<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> be<00:03:06.700> milling<00:03:07.390> around

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
from Park are going to be milling around

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.900 
from Park are going to be milling around
that<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.990> event<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.470> evening<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.070> so
