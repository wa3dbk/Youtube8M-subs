ultegra<00:00:49.940> toothless<00:00:50.940> wheelset<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
ultegra toothless wheelset and so you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.170 
ultegra toothless wheelset and so you
know<00:00:52.250> people<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.309> read<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.579> blog<00:00:53.760> post

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
make me a better writer no you're the
kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> blend<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.200> need<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.439> do

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

they're<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> great<00:01:08.820> all-around<00:01:09.119> wheelset

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
they're just a great all-around wheelset

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
they're just a great all-around wheelset
so<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> compare<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so I got kind of compare thing to that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
so I got kind of compare thing to that
but<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> rails<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
but when I think about the rails you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
but when I think about the rails you
know<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> rail<00:01:14.310> 30<00:01:14.850> fours<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.570> 52<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
know the rail 30 fours here 52 is the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.280 
know the rail 30 fours here 52 is the
same<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.040> before<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.930> feel<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.080> these

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
same way before I really feel like these

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.450 
same way before I really feel like these
things<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.680> active<00:01:19.979> part<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
things are an active part of the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
things are an active part of the
experience<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.180> feel<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> ride

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
experience like I feel them when I ride

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.370 
experience like I feel them when I ride
I<00:01:22.790> feel<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.909> pulling<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.780> hill<00:01:25.080> i

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I feel like pulling me down hill i

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
I feel like pulling me down hill i
justjust<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:26.009> faster<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
justjust go faster in it and then the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
justjust go faster in it and then the
stiffness<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.130> wheels<00:01:29.310> themselves

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
stiffness of the the wheels themselves

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.690 
stiffness of the the wheels themselves
you<00:01:30.060> definitely<00:01:30.299> give<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.630> boost<00:01:30.979> up<00:01:31.979> hill<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.460> i

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you definitely give a boost up hill so i

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
you definitely give a boost up hill so i
do<00:01:33.299> feel<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.200> make<00:01:34.590> me<00:01:34.710> ride<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bit faster and a bit stronger so just

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.910 
bit faster and a bit stronger so just
kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> confidence<00:01:39.540> inspiring<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.290> i<00:01:40.500> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
kind of confidence inspiring so i like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
kind of confidence inspiring so i like
that<00:01:41.240> terms<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> price<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> may<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.079> can't

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that terms of price you may really can't

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
that terms of price you may really can't
go<00:01:43.439> wrong<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:44.009> november<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.700> they

real<00:03:06.550> quick<00:03:06.760> yeah<00:03:07.470> obviously<00:03:08.470> depth<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:09.550> also

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
real quick yeah obviously depth but also

real quick yeah obviously depth but also
I<00:03:10.510> felt<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> 34<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.130> little<00:03:12.370> more

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
I felt like the 34 just a little more

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.570 
I felt like the 34 just a little more
agile<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.120> what<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.660> expect<00:03:13.930> from<00:03:14.140> a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
agile is what you would expect from a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.979 
agile is what you would expect from a
little<00:03:15.580> more<00:03:15.760> narrow<00:03:15.910> butyl<00:03:17.070> dish<00:03:18.070> wheel<00:03:18.370> so

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
little more narrow butyl dish wheel so

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.050 
little more narrow butyl dish wheel so
so<00:03:19.989> that's<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:21.100> know<00:03:21.310> where<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:21.880> go<00:03:22.000> with

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
so that's a that's know where we go with

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.430 
so that's a that's know where we go with
that<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.300> little<00:03:22.630> bit<00:03:22.840> more<00:03:22.959> agile<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.030> so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that a little bit more agile and so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.610 
that a little bit more agile and so
bottom<00:03:26.440> line<00:03:26.470> no<00:03:27.040> price<00:03:27.310> great<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
bottom line no price great the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.530 
bottom line no price great the
performances<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:30.180> walking<00:03:31.180> by<00:03:31.269> them<00:03:31.420> here

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
performances there walking by them here

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.500 
performances there walking by them here
so<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.840> what<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.380> with<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:33.390> light<00:03:34.390> video

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
so this what we do with the light video

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.360
