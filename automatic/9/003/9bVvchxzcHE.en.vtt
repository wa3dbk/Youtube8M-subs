guys<00:00:03.870> through<00:00:03.929> what<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.439> did<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:05.939> the

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
guys through what I did to make the

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.329 
guys through what I did to make the
intake<00:00:06.749> manifold<00:00:07.319> for<00:00:07.499> my<00:00:07.620> Suzuki<00:00:07.950> barber

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:10.339 
intake manifold for my Suzuki barber

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.589 
intake manifold for my Suzuki barber
first<00:00:11.339> thing<00:00:11.549> you<00:00:11.639> really<00:00:11.790> need<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.360> top

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
first thing you really need to do is top

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.959 
first thing you really need to do is top
with<00:00:12.750> size<00:00:13.250> exhaust<00:00:14.250> tubing<00:00:14.580> you're<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
with size exhaust tubing you're going to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
with size exhaust tubing you're going to
get<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.629> what<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> used<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.370> my

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
get because that's what I used so in my

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.120 
get because that's what I used so in my
case<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.990> look<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.830> past<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
case you look through here get past the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.410 
case you look through here get past the
speedometer<00:00:20.640> cable<00:00:21.560> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.390> boot<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
speedometer cable this is the boot that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.780 
speedometer cable this is the boot that
the<00:00:24.960> carburetor<00:00:25.440> would<00:00:25.590> normally<00:00:25.920> sit<00:00:26.580> right

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
the carburetor would normally sit right

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.310 
the carburetor would normally sit right
on<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.360> this<00:00:27.480> clamp<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:27.870> I<00:00:27.990> temporarily

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
on to in this clamp that I temporarily

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.590 
on to in this clamp that I temporarily
have<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:29.070> carburetor<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.120> normally<00:00:30.480> be

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
have here carburetor would normally be

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.930 
have here carburetor would normally be
sitting<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:30.930> here<00:00:31.399> if<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.519> measure<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
sitting right here if you measure the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.939 
sitting right here if you measure the
inside<00:00:33.269> diameter<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.079> that's<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.679> inch

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
inside diameter that that's about inch

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.069 
inside diameter that that's about inch
and<00:00:35.100> 3/4<00:00:35.640> give<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and 3/4 give or take because it is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.060 
and 3/4 give or take because it is
metric<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.850> went<00:00:39.089> down<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.530> or<00:00:40.530> went<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.859> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
metric so I went down to or went on to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.770 
metric so I went down to or went on to
the<00:00:41.160> local<00:00:41.460> jeg<00:00:41.670> website<00:00:42.379> got<00:00:43.379> me<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.829> steel

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the local jeg website got me some steel

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
the local jeg website got me some steel
inch<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> three-quarter<00:00:46.760> J<00:00:47.760> Bend<00:00:47.999> exhaust

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
inch and three-quarter J Bend exhaust

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
inch and three-quarter J Bend exhaust
tubing<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.879> got<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> smallest<00:00:51.359> Bend<00:00:52.850> radius

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
tubing I got the smallest Bend radius

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.489 
tubing I got the smallest Bend radius
that<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.390> had<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.929> I<00:00:55.050> knew<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.379> was

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
that they had because I knew it was

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:56.959 
that they had because I knew it was
going<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.679> be<00:00:55.800> fairly<00:00:56.100> tight<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
going to be fairly tight right in here I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.669 
going to be fairly tight right in here I
got<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.359> inch<00:00:57.569> radius<00:00:57.839> which<00:00:58.170> four<00:00:58.559> inch

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
got two inch radius which four inch

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.130 
got two inch radius which four inch
diameter<00:00:58.890> obviously<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.420> normally<00:01:00.839> it<00:01:01.050> would

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
diameter obviously so normally it would

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
diameter obviously so normally it would
be<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> J<00:01:01.559> would<00:01:01.769> come<00:01:01.949> around<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.429> then<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
be a J would come around and then just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.830 
be a J would come around and then just
keep<00:01:03.659> going<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> got

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
keep going out like that so when I got

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.610 
keep going out like that so when I got
the<00:01:06.990> tubing<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> center<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> J<00:01:09.620> cut

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
the tubing I got the center of the J cut

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.820 
the tubing I got the center of the J cut
a<00:01:10.650> straight<00:01:10.890> line<00:01:11.100> across<00:01:11.960> then<00:01:12.960> rotated<00:01:13.710> at

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a straight line across then rotated at

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.450 
a straight line across then rotated at
90<00:01:14.130> degrees<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.170> there

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
90 degrees which is what you see there

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.430 
90 degrees which is what you see there
so<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> few<00:01:18.180> tacks<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.020> area<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
so I put a few tacks in this area you

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.820 
so I put a few tacks in this area you
can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.620> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.980> all<00:01:20.100> seam<00:01:20.340> welded<00:01:20.790> then

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
can see this is all seam welded then

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.150 
can see this is all seam welded then
once<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.980> got<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:24.680> positioned<00:01:25.680> where<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> wanted

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
once I got it positioned where I wanted

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.800 
once I got it positioned where I wanted
there<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.370> had<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.760> figure<00:01:26.910> out<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> wanted

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there I had to figure out where I wanted

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440 
there I had to figure out where I wanted
to<00:01:27.900> put<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.140> carburetor<00:01:28.880> side-to-side<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to put the carburetor side-to-side so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.970 
to put the carburetor side-to-side so
when<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> simple<00:01:31.290> matter<00:01:31.410> of<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> kind

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
when it was a simple matter of just kind

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.530 
when it was a simple matter of just kind
of<00:01:32.040> positioning<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.090> cutting<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
of positioning it and then cutting the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.760 
of positioning it and then cutting the
tubing<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.980> now<00:01:35.100> you're<00:01:35.250> left<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.730> task

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
tubing so now you're left with the task

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.170 
tubing so now you're left with the task
how<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.670> connect<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
how are you going to connect the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.020 
how are you going to connect the
carburetor<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> intake<00:01:40.430> well<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.760> down<00:01:41.940> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
carburetor the intake well go down to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
carburetor the intake well go down to
your<00:01:42.090> local<00:01:42.210> auto<00:01:42.450> parts<00:01:42.540> store<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.290> since

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
your local auto parts store and since

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
your local auto parts store and since
this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.190> inch<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> 3/4<00:01:44.880> tubing<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:46.020> inch

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this is inch and 3/4 tubing I got inch

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
this is inch and 3/4 tubing I got inch
and<00:01:46.320> 3/4<00:01:46.710> radiator<00:01:47.160> hose<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> buy<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.110> by

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and 3/4 radiator hose you can buy it by

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.350 
and 3/4 radiator hose you can buy it by
the<00:01:49.350> foot<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.950> didn't<00:01:50.670> need<00:01:50.730> that<00:01:50.790> much<00:01:50.940> but<00:01:51.150> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the foot I didn't need that much but I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.250 
the foot I didn't need that much but I
got<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.690> anyway

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
got it anyway

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.920 
got it anyway
then<00:01:53.190> clamped<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.180> carburetor

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
then clamped it on and then carburetor

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
then clamped it on and then carburetor
mounts<00:01:55.200> directly<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:56.000> then<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
mounts directly to that then to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.720 
mounts directly to that then to
strengthen<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.750> whole<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.730> made

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
strengthen this whole thing up I made

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.980 
strengthen this whole thing up I made
this<00:01:59.910> piece<00:02:00.150> now<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> looks<00:02:00.870> like

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this piece now you know this looks like

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
this piece now you know this looks like
a<00:02:01.050> screwdriver<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> few<00:02:02.130> people<00:02:02.430> say<00:02:02.610> uh

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a screwdriver right a few people say uh

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
a screwdriver right a few people say uh
look<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.210> cut<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> screwdriver<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.990> bent<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
look you cut a screwdriver and bent it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.239 
look you cut a screwdriver and bent it
now<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> piece<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> 3/8<00:02:07.039> cold<00:02:08.039> rolled

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:08.249 
now this is a piece of 3/8 cold rolled

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.869 
now this is a piece of 3/8 cold rolled
steel<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.909> can<00:02:09.349> forge<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> end<00:02:10.769> I'm<00:02:11.700> going

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
steel and I can forge the end I'm going

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.090 
steel and I can forge the end I'm going
to<00:02:11.939> redo<00:02:12.299> this<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.689> get<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> away<00:02:13.140> from<00:02:13.349> looking

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
to redo this to get it away from looking

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.160 
to redo this to get it away from looking
a<00:02:14.160> screwdriver<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.420> essentially<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> did

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
a screwdriver but essentially what I did

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.340 
a screwdriver but essentially what I did
was<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.880> mounted<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> seat

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
was I mounted it to this to the seat

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.100 
was I mounted it to this to the seat
shock<00:02:19.650> mount<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.930> see

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
shock mount and as you can see

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.160 
shock mount and as you can see
underneath<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.590> came<00:02:22.800> around<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.110> welded<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
underneath I came around and welded it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.760 
underneath I came around and welded it
in<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.440> places<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.000> pretty<00:02:27.150> secure

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
in two places so this is pretty secure

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.410 
in two places so this is pretty secure
this<00:02:28.770> isn't<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.190> anywhere<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> easy

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this isn't going anywhere as the easy

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.790 
this isn't going anywhere as the easy
part<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> only<00:02:34.200> thing<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.650> need

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
part now the only thing you really need

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950 
part now the only thing you really need
to<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.160> which<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.240> kind<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> common<00:02:36.810> sense

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
to know which is kind of common sense

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.020 
to know which is kind of common sense
actually<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.220> intake<00:02:38.550> manifold

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually is that this intake manifold

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
actually is that this intake manifold
you're<00:02:39.180> creating<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.570> vacuum<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.770> when<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> do

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you're creating a vacuum so when you do

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.100 
you're creating a vacuum so when you do
this<00:02:41.460> well<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.910> weld<00:02:42.150> has<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.780> watertight

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
this well this weld has to be watertight

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.080 
this well this weld has to be watertight
now<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.740> sands<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.100> butts<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.640> actually

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
now we have sands or butts and actually

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.410 
now we have sands or butts and actually
I<00:02:45.590> use<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.280> sealed<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:48.030> end<00:02:48.210> with<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
I use the I sealed up one end with the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.540 
I use the I sealed up one end with the
radiator<00:02:48.780> hose<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> plug<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.250> used<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
radiator hose and a plug and I used a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.730 
radiator hose and a plug and I used a
pressure<00:02:51.540> test<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> radiator<00:02:52.470> pressure

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
pressure test or a radiator pressure

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.200 
pressure test or a radiator pressure
tester<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> other<00:02:53.460> side<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.850> put<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> up

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
tester on the other side and I put it up

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.990 
tester on the other side and I put it up
to<00:02:54.240> about<00:02:55.040> ten<00:02:56.040> pounds<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.580> didn't<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.850> really

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to about ten pounds I didn't go really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.760 
to about ten pounds I didn't go really
want<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> go<00:02:57.330> too<00:02:57.390> crazy<00:02:57.540> long<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.590> didn't

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
want to go too crazy long as I didn't

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.070 
want to go too crazy long as I didn't
see<00:02:58.860> any<00:02:59.010> water<00:02:59.190> coming<00:02:59.310> through<00:02:59.550> here<00:03:00.080> I'm

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
see any water coming through here I'm

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.390 
see any water coming through here I'm
good<00:03:01.350> because<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.740> see<00:03:01.890> water<00:03:02.070> coming

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
good because if you see water coming

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220 
good because if you see water coming
through<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.300> potential<00:03:03.720> vacuum<00:03:04.080> leak

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
through that's a potential vacuum leak

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
through that's a potential vacuum leak
vacuum<00:03:04.770> leaks<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.190> cause<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.490> thing<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> run

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
vacuum leaks can cause this thing to run

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.760 
vacuum leaks can cause this thing to run
like<00:03:05.970> crap<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:07.050> you'll<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.290> chasing<00:03:07.680> that

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
like crap and you'll be chasing that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.850 
like crap and you'll be chasing that
forever<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.960> do<00:03:10.110> have<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> easy

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
forever and if you do have that the easy

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.710 
forever and if you do have that the easy
way<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.520> do<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> take<00:03:12.270> some<00:03:12.480> carb

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
way to do it is to take some carb

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780 
way to do it is to take some carb
cleaner<00:03:12.900> while<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> engine<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.280> running<00:03:14.340> and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
cleaner while the engine is running and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.120 
cleaner while the engine is running and
spray<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.810> over<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.140> intake<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.950> get

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
spray it all over the intake if you get

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.540 
spray it all over the intake if you get
as<00:03:17.310> you're<00:03:18.000> spraying<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:19.100> if<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.310> engine

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
as you're spraying that if the engine

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.730 
as you're spraying that if the engine
smoothes<00:03:20.820> out<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.210> away<00:03:21.500> then<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> can

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
smoothes out right away then you can

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.890 
smoothes out right away then you can
kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> localize<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.790> spray<00:03:24.120> where

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
kind of localize with the spray where

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.510 
kind of localize with the spray where
you<00:03:25.050> get<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> smoother<00:03:25.740> running<00:03:25.920> that's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
you get the smoother running that's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
you get the smoother running that's
where<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:26.910> leak<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.660> for<00:03:28.380> those<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.500> you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
where your leak is so for those of you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830 
where your leak is so for those of you
that<00:03:28.830> didn't<00:03:29.130> know<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.520> it's<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> good<00:03:30.630> little

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that didn't know that it's a good little

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
that didn't know that it's a good little
tip<00:03:30.960> you<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.170> also<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> pinch<00:03:31.830> use<00:03:31.980> wd-40

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
tip you can also in a pinch use wd-40

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.190 
tip you can also in a pinch use wd-40
for<00:03:33.390> those<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.720> did<00:03:34.160> good<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:36.200> all

for those that did good for you all
right<00:03:38.240> it's<00:03:39.240> about<00:03:39.270> as<00:03:39.540> far<00:03:39.600> as<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.930> got<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.380> far

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
right it's about as far as I got so far

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.670 
right it's about as far as I got so far
as<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.190> had<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:42.680> compression

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
as you can see I had the compression

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.100 
as you can see I had the compression
release<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.130> was<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.460> to<00:03:44.520> make<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:45.110> separate

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
release I was going to make a separate

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.870 
release I was going to make a separate
lever<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.860> decided<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.550> keep<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
lever for this but I decided to keep the

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.020 
lever for this but I decided to keep the
electric<00:03:48.210> solenoid<00:03:49.130> made<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.310> bracket<00:03:50.760> for

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
electric solenoid made this bracket for

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.440 
electric solenoid made this bracket for
it<00:03:52.190> see<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.340> red<00:03:53.520> there<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.790> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.240> cut

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it see the red there is going to get cut

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.600 
it see the red there is going to get cut
out<00:03:54.630> because<00:03:54.810> eventually<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.550> to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
out because eventually this is going to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.110 
out because eventually this is going to
get<00:03:56.730> mounted<00:03:57.210> up<00:03:57.980> underneath<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.310> gas<00:03:59.700> tank

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
get mounted up underneath the gas tank

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.500 
get mounted up underneath the gas tank
if<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.330> could<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.720> there<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
if you could see there and it's to the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.690 
if you could see there and it's to the
point<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> wishbones<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.770> way<00:04:04.920> and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
point of the wishbones is in the way and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.970 
point of the wishbones is in the way and
that's<00:04:05.850> what<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.320> red<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.680> there<00:04:07.860> I'll

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
that's what that red is on there I'll

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.340 
that's what that red is on there I'll
cut<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.930> will<00:04:10.020> clear<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
cut that out and that will clear the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.780 
cut that out and that will clear the
tube<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.800> then<00:04:10.920> with<00:04:11.130> those<00:04:11.280> two<00:04:11.430> holes<00:04:11.610> I'll

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
tube and then with those two holes I'll

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.180 
tube and then with those two holes I'll
bolt<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.270> place<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:13.560> it's<00:04:13.710> just<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.920> simple

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
bolt it in place and it's just a simple

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.490 
bolt it in place and it's just a simple
on-off<00:04:14.670> right<00:04:15.390> now<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.660> solenoid<00:04:16.350> is

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
on-off right now the solenoid is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.820 
on-off right now the solenoid is
normally<00:04:16.890> open<00:04:18.170> when<00:04:19.170> you<00:04:19.290> charge<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.710> it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
normally open when you charge it it

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.440 
normally open when you charge it it
closes<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:21.120> when<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.359> close<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:22.560> opens

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
closes and when you close it it opens

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.030 
closes and when you close it it opens
the<00:04:24.450> compression<00:04:24.900> release<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.860> said

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the compression release like I said

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.870 
the compression release like I said
earlier<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.400> one<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.550> my

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
earlier in one of my

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.060 
earlier in one of my
videos<00:04:27.300> these<00:04:28.140> single-cylinder<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
videos these single-cylinder is the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.590 
videos these single-cylinder is the
starter<00:04:29.400> motor<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.790> small<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.240> them<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.420> can

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
starter motor so small on them it can

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.560 
starter motor so small on them it can
overcome<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:32.040> compression<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.180> need<00:04:33.480> to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
overcome the compression so you need to

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.670 
overcome the compression so you need to
have<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.780> compression<00:04:34.230> at<00:04:34.320> least<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.620> start

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
have this compression at least to start

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.290 
have this compression at least to start
it's<00:04:35.010> all<00:04:35.130> just<00:04:35.340> wire<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.640> up<00:04:35.790> simple<00:04:36.090> one

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it's all just wire that up simple one

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's all just wire that up simple one
wire<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.530> start<00:04:37.860> part<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.280> key<00:04:38.490> it

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
wire to the start part of the key it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.670 
wire to the start part of the key it

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
will go on in a minute I shut the key

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.430 
will go on in a minute I shut the key
off<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:41.790> start<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.240> let<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.480> run<00:04:42.660> it'll<00:04:42.900> de

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
off the start to let it run it'll de

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.250 
off the start to let it run it'll de
energize<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.980> solenoid<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.840> that's<00:04:45.990> about<00:04:46.110> it

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
energize the solenoid so that's about it

if you want to make your own intake it's
fairly<00:04:49.200> simple<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.340> matter<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.580> a
