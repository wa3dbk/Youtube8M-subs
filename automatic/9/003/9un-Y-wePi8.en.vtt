you're<00:00:08.860> just<00:00:09.070> because<00:00:09.309> I<00:00:09.340> think<00:00:09.520> this<00:00:09.790> allows

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
you're just because I think this allows

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.120 
you're just because I think this allows
me<00:00:10.540> to<00:00:10.660> communicate<00:00:10.840> with<00:00:11.350> the<00:00:11.470> dog<00:00:11.650> a<00:00:11.830> lot

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
me to communicate with the dog a lot

me to communicate with the dog a lot
more<00:00:12.370> genuinely<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:13.690> toy<00:00:13.929> itself<00:00:14.470> is<00:00:14.740> not<00:00:15.190> as

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
more genuinely the toy itself is not as

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.760 
more genuinely the toy itself is not as
important<00:00:15.969> as<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.930> attitude<00:00:17.470> that<00:00:17.619> you're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
important as the attitude that you're

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.260 
important as the attitude that you're
gonna<00:00:17.980> have<00:00:18.250> when<00:00:18.430> you're<00:00:18.580> teaching<00:00:18.790> this<00:00:19.060> to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
gonna have when you're teaching this to

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.800 
gonna have when you're teaching this to
a<00:00:19.300> dog

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
a dog

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.499 
a dog
mostly<00:00:20.439> because<00:00:20.829> in<00:00:21.040> dog<00:00:21.220> training

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
mostly because in dog training

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.580 
mostly because in dog training
enthusiasm<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.660> contagious<00:00:22.750> so<00:00:23.380> if<00:00:23.439> we're

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
enthusiasm is contagious so if we're

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.170 
enthusiasm is contagious so if we're
going<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.860> be<00:00:23.950> very<00:00:24.160> excited<00:00:24.669> about<00:00:24.820> something

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
going to be very excited about something

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.330 
going to be very excited about something
the<00:00:25.689> dog<00:00:25.899> is<00:00:26.079> also<00:00:26.320> going<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.680> develop<00:00:26.950> a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
the dog is also going to develop a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.460 
the dog is also going to develop a
similar<00:00:27.849> attitude<00:00:28.060> towards<00:00:28.750> whatever<00:00:29.290> we're

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
similar attitude towards whatever we're

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:50.939 
similar attitude towards whatever we're
doing<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:48.899> highly<00:00:49.899> recommend<00:00:50.320> using<00:00:50.499> a<00:00:50.710> clicker

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
doing I highly recommend using a clicker

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
click in a tree now dogs have a natural

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.500 
click in a tree now dogs have a natural
tendency<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.709> follow<00:02:51.070> or<00:02:51.400> chase<00:02:51.820> things<00:02:52.180> that
