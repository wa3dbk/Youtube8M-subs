00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:03.700 

and<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:57.320> butter<00:01:59.030> just<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.470> chunk<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.560> butter

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.600 

okay<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> way<00:02:05.100> we're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.370> to<00:02:05.430> mix

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
okay now the way we're going to mix

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.070 
okay now the way we're going to mix
these<00:02:05.760> is<00:02:05.970> we're<00:02:06.120> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> basically<00:02:06.630> focus

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
these is we're going to basically focus

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.290 
these is we're going to basically focus
on<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.590> butter<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.790> clump<00:02:09.060> up

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
on the butter that's going to clump up

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.320 
on the butter that's going to clump up
so<00:02:10.290> use<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.560> fork<00:02:11.100> because<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> smash

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so use your fork because you can smash

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.410 
so use your fork because you can smash
it<00:02:12.570> against<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> side<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.760> creating<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it against the side kind of creating a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.770 
it against the side kind of creating a
bunch<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.750> little<00:02:16.760> little<00:02:17.760> tinier<00:02:18.210> pieces<00:02:18.660> of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
bunch of little little tinier pieces of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
bunch of little little tinier pieces of
butter<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.410> eventually<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.850> just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
butter and eventually it's going to just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:36.820 
butter and eventually it's going to just
become<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:23.330> all<00:02:24.330> mixed<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.940 

kind<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:39.500> almost<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.800> what

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
kind of like a little almost like what

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.600 
kind of like a little almost like what
you<00:02:41.100> would<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.550> do<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.970> make<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.330> pie<00:02:42.840> crust<00:02:43.610> or

you would you do to make a pie crust or

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:55.670 
you would you do to make a pie crust or
something<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
something like that you just want it to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.020 
something like that you just want it to
be<00:02:55.770> consistent<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.460> don't<00:02:56.610> want<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> big<00:02:56.910> ol

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
be consistent you don't want a big ol

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.930 
be consistent you don't want a big ol
clump<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.420> butter<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.760> most

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
clump of butter and then the most

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:19.430 
clump of butter and then the most
important<00:03:00.390> ingredient<00:03:01.670> mr.<00:03:02.670> egg<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
important ingredient mr. egg and the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.440 
important ingredient mr. egg and the
reason<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.130> called<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.580> one<00:03:20.820> minute<00:03:23.450> is

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
reason it is called a one minute is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.270 
reason it is called a one minute is
because<00:03:24.870> then<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.500> microwave<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.220> for

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
because then you just microwave it for

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.860 
because then you just microwave it for
one<00:03:29.280> minute<00:03:29.480> fly<00:03:30.480> me<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.590> moon<00:03:32.540> let<00:03:33.540> me

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
one minute fly me to the moon let me

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.930 
one minute fly me to the moon let me
play<00:03:34.610> among<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.970> stars<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:40.320> our<00:03:41.130> one<00:03:41.610> minute

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
play among the stars and our one minute

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910 
play among the stars and our one minute
breakfast<00:03:42.780> muffin<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.200> done<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.739> see

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
breakfast muffin is done and you see

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.229 
breakfast muffin is done and you see
it's<00:03:44.070> already<00:03:44.190> pulling<00:03:44.519> away<00:03:44.730> from<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.090> edges

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
it's already pulling away from the edges

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.479 
it's already pulling away from the edges
so<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.290> shake<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.769> little<00:03:46.799> bit<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.310> get<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
so you shake it a little bit to get it

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.350 
so you shake it a little bit to get it
kind<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.730> loosened<00:03:48.260> what<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.350> like<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> do<00:03:50.360> just
