hey guys welcome to the part of the
video<00:00:16.800> I'm<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> show<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.940> little<00:00:18.180> bit

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
video I'm going to show you a little bit

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.839 
video I'm going to show you a little bit
about<00:00:18.600> EVGA<00:00:19.590> s<00:00:19.910> tuning<00:00:20.910> software<00:00:21.500> precision<00:00:22.500> X

I've<00:00:23.849> got<00:00:24.710> Unigine<00:00:25.710> Heaven<00:00:26.580> running<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
I've got Unigine Heaven running in the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.170 
I've got Unigine Heaven running in the
background<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.849> as<00:00:29.849> I

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
background so that we can see as I

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.540 
background so that we can see as I
adjust<00:00:30.599> things<00:00:30.779> when<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.860> if<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
adjust things when or if there is a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.900 
adjust things when or if there is a
problem<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> shouldn't<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.760> any

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
problem but I shouldn't have any

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
problem but I shouldn't have any
problems<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> good<00:00:38.010> idea<00:00:38.220> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
problems I think I have a good idea of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.200 
problems I think I have a good idea of
where<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.920> where<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.070> card<00:00:41.399> wants<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> sit

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
where the where this card wants to sit

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
where the where this card wants to sit
so<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> course<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.260> default<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:44.010> now

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so of course it is at default right now

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.810 
so of course it is at default right now
and<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:46.019> just<00:00:46.289> simply<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.859> you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and you just simply have you can see the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
and you just simply have you can see the
graphics<00:00:48.510> card<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:49.140> monitoring

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
graphics card that you're monitoring

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
graphics card that you're monitoring
right<00:00:49.859> here<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.429> then<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.629> some

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
right here and then you have some

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.040 
right here and then you have some
information<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.969> settings<00:00:54.750> here

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
information here and your settings here

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.489 
information here and your settings here
your<00:00:55.230> configuration<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.420> then<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.379> know

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
your configuration and then a you know

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.410 
your configuration and then a you know
you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.769> adjust<00:00:59.129> fan<00:00:59.399> curve<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.179> watch

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you can adjust fan curve you can watch

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
you can adjust fan curve you can watch
your<00:01:00.600> fan<00:01:00.839> speed<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.589> your<00:01:01.949> temperature<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
your fan speed and your temperature of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
your fan speed and your temperature of
course<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.449> set<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.460> Fahrenheit

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
course that can be set to Fahrenheit

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
course that can be set to Fahrenheit
over<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.180> configuration<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> things

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
over here in configuration and things

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.930 
over here in configuration and things
like<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
like that

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.760 
like that
the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the first thing we're going to do you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000 
the first thing we're going to do you
can<00:01:11.120> adjust<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.270> GPU<00:01:12.810> clock<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> memory

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
can adjust the GPU clock and the memory

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.289 
can adjust the GPU clock and the memory
offset<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:16.220> use<00:01:17.220> instead<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.729> dragging<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.210> with

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
offset I use instead of dragging it with

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
offset I use instead of dragging it with
the<00:01:18.420> mouse<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.810> use<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> arrow<00:01:19.409> keys<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the mouse I use the arrow keys it is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
the mouse I use the arrow keys it is
much<00:01:20.579> more<00:01:20.820> precise<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
much more precise we can get that up

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.520 
much more precise we can get that up
over<00:01:23.009> 50<00:01:23.610> pretty<00:01:23.909> easily<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
over 50 pretty easily I'm just going to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370 
over 50 pretty easily I'm just going to
apply<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
apply that and you can see that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
apply that and you can see that
continues<00:01:28.979> running<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.579> fine

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
continues running just fine

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.899 
continues running just fine
and<00:01:30.350> where<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.770> benchmarking<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and where I actually benchmarking it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
and where I actually benchmarking it
would<00:01:33.060> most<00:01:33.390> likely<00:01:34.009> increase<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
would most likely increase the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
would most likely increase the
performance<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.479> we're<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
performance there we're going to go a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
performance there we're going to go a
little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.009> further<00:01:38.719> push<00:01:39.719> it<00:01:39.899> up<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
little bit further push it up to a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.130 
little bit further push it up to a
hundred

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.930 

and<00:01:45.670> adjust<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.909> voltage<00:01:47.240> over<00:01:48.020> here<00:01:51.940> you

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
and adjust the voltage over here you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.730 
and adjust the voltage over here you
have<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.150> accept<00:01:53.630> because<00:01:54.050> they<00:01:54.409> kind<00:01:54.650> of

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
have to accept because they kind of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.800 
have to accept because they kind of
warned<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.700> careful<00:01:55.970> with<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.510> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
warned you to be careful with this and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.109 
warned you to be careful with this and
you<00:01:57.290> don't<00:01:57.500> want<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:57.920> crank<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.400> up<00:01:58.580> I've

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
you don't want to just crank it up I've

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.030 
you don't want to just crank it up I've
already<00:01:59.510> done<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.170> bit<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.380> testing<00:02:00.680> at

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
already done a little bit of testing at

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.219 
already done a little bit of testing at
a<00:02:01.070> couple<00:02:01.400> different<00:02:01.430> levels<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.240> 12

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
a couple different levels and 12

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.060 
a couple different levels and 12
millivolts<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:03.979> perfect<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.650> apply<00:02:07.040> that

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
millivolts is perfect so I apply that

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.130 
millivolts is perfect so I apply that
and<00:02:07.640> then<00:02:07.909> I'll<00:02:08.030> just<00:02:08.060> minimize<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:09.020> of

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
and then I'll just minimize it out of

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.920 
and then I'll just minimize it out of
the<00:02:09.200> way<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.459> allows<00:02:10.789> me<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.180> should<00:02:11.750> be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the way and that allows me I should be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.520 
the way and that allows me I should be
able<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> get<00:02:12.470> up<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:13.480> 115<00:02:14.480> seems<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.260> about

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
able to get up to 115 seems to be about

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.490 
able to get up to 115 seems to be about
where<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.550> maxes<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.630> then<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.230> want<00:02:18.410> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
where it maxes out and then I want to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.479 
where it maxes out and then I want to
increase<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.100> memory<00:02:19.459> also<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.100> head<00:02:22.280> that

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
increase the memory also so we head that

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.500 
increase the memory also so we head that
up<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.390> or<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:24.290> one<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:24.800> up<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.459> 55<00:02:26.150> and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
up to one or not one but up to 55 and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.259 
up to one or not one but up to 55 and
then<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.260> hit<00:02:27.440> apply<00:02:27.850> everything<00:02:28.850> keeps

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
then I hit apply everything keeps

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.080 
then I hit apply everything keeps

increase<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.050> little<00:02:33.410> there<00:02:34.120> well<00:02:35.120> some<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.450> it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660

you know it hops around just because the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
image is changing but so there you have

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.830 
image is changing but so there you have

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
temperature a little bit but you don't

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.630 
temperature a little bit but you don't
really<00:03:02.120> need<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.079> can<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.560> even<00:03:04.340> under
