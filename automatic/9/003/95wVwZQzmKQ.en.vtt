they<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> benefit<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.350> seeing<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.799> 4k

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
they want the benefit of seeing a 4k

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
they want the benefit of seeing a 4k
content<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.119> may<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.720> access<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.740> a
