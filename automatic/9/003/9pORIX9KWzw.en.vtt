00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
I'm going to show you basically how to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.630 
I'm going to show you basically how to
throw<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:32.689> cast<00:00:33.050> net<00:00:33.350> it's<00:00:33.830> not<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:34.250> big<00:00:34.400> I

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
throw a cast net it's not that big I

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.229 
throw a cast net it's not that big I
think<00:00:34.850> it's<00:00:34.940> eight<00:00:35.150> foot<00:00:35.449> an<00:00:35.629> eight-foot<00:00:36.050> net

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
think it's eight foot an eight-foot net

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.259 
think it's eight foot an eight-foot net
four<00:00:38.239> foot<00:00:38.420> radius<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.140> eight<00:00:39.350> foot<00:00:39.589> spread

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
four foot radius so eight foot spread

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.729 
four foot radius so eight foot spread
but<00:00:41.269> I'm<00:00:41.570> going<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.780> show<00:00:41.900> you<00:00:41.960> how<00:00:42.049> easy<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.680> is

plasti ring or something the ring on the
top<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.079> get<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:39.319> one<00:01:39.469> hand<00:01:39.499> like<00:01:39.890> this

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
top you get it in one hand like this

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.240 
top you get it in one hand like this
slide<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.979> head<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.249> the<00:01:43.429> rope<00:01:43.640> about

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
slide the head of the rope about

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
slide the head of the rope about
caught<00:01:45.910> our<00:01:46.060> way<00:01:46.150> down<00:01:46.390> until<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:47.080> most

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
caught our way down until the most

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.860 
caught our way down until the most
natural<00:01:47.530> feel<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.100> net<00:01:48.280> get<00:01:48.460> thicker<00:01:48.870> now

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
natural feel the net get thicker now

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.090 
natural feel the net get thicker now
this<00:01:50.050> is<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.410> most<00:01:51.330> simple<00:01:52.330> way<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.140> pancake

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
this is the most simple way to pancake

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.090 
this is the most simple way to pancake
it's<00:01:54.460> two<00:01:54.640> steps<00:01:54.880> that's<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> lead

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
it's two steps that's it take the lead

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's two steps that's it take the lead
line<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.580> put<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.820> in<00:02:01.150> your<00:02:01.240> mouth<00:02:01.390> just

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
line like this put it in your mouth just

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.210 
line like this put it in your mouth just
the<00:02:01.930> rope<00:02:02.140> don't<00:02:02.440> put<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> light<00:02:02.830> weights<00:02:03.070> in

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
the rope don't put the light weights in

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.780 
the rope don't put the light weights in
your<00:02:03.540> mouth<00:02:04.540> as<00:02:04.840> leads<00:02:05.320> not<00:02:05.530> good<00:02:05.770> put<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.760> in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
your mouth as leads not good put it in

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.410 
your mouth as leads not good put it in
your<00:02:06.970> mouth<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.510> guess<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.369> see<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:09.700> just

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
your mouth I guess you can see this just

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
your mouth I guess you can see this just

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.200 

the<00:05:32.840> other<00:05:33.380> ways<00:05:33.620> aren't<00:05:33.920> as<00:05:34.250> efficient

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.610 

sometimes<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.390> doesn't<00:05:38.690> pancake<00:05:39.080> sometimes

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
sometimes it doesn't pancake sometimes

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.500 
sometimes it doesn't pancake sometimes
it<00:05:39.830> does<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:41.200> this<00:05:42.200> is<00:05:42.350> the<00:05:42.470> last<00:05:42.680> way<00:05:43.390> this<00:05:44.390> is

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
it does and this is the last way this is

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.080 
it does and this is the last way this is
the<00:05:44.600> way<00:05:44.720> that<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.020> net<00:05:45.230> comes<00:05:45.530> with

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
the way that the net comes with

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.550 
the way that the net comes with
instructions<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.540> really<00:05:47.780> bad<00:05:47.960> method<00:05:48.440> I

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
instructions it's really bad method I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.400 
instructions it's really bad method I
don't<00:05:48.830> recommend<00:05:49.160> using<00:05:49.460> this<00:05:50.170> what<00:05:51.170> you<00:05:51.260> do

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
don't recommend using this what you do

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.780 
don't recommend using this what you do
is<00:05:51.770> you<00:05:51.890> take<00:05:51.920> this<00:05:52.310> put<00:05:52.970> it<00:05:53.000> in<00:05:53.120> this<00:05:53.270> hand<00:05:53.510> and

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
is you take this put it in this hand and

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.520 
is you take this put it in this hand and
then<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:55.910> quarter<00:05:56.450> open<00:05:56.750> it<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.200> and

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
then you quarter open it like that and

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.159 
then you quarter open it like that and
then<00:05:58.130> you<00:05:58.250> Slough<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.670> late<00:05:59.320> swing<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.590> around

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
then you Slough it late swing it around

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:09.870 
then you Slough it late swing it around
this<00:06:03.169> really<00:06:03.500> doesn't<00:06:03.680> work<00:06:03.919> all<00:06:04.130> too<00:06:04.340> well
