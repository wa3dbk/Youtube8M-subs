 logic did not take a player who 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.640
 exceed your budget for example if

 look at its price take the cheapest 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.130
 in a good composition and especially 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 just stick to that player 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 so see you're trying to authorize in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.530

 here is that on a single player stage 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 number 2 the technique of buying 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 immediate then this technique is very 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.030
 simple for example a player who costs 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.009
 2000 credit generally well you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.520
 for immediate purchase 1400 credit 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.429
 you 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.710
 you reset when searching 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.240
 regularly by pressing y or 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.369
 triangle on ps3 or xbox and that's it then 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.729
 good it takes patience 1 it's clear 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.009
 and net 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.659
 but maybe at some point you 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.829
 will fall on fear to their art here is 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.110
 me it happens to me and thanks to this 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.959
 nab technology ja Yohan Cabaye 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.119
 in 4-4-2 to 800 third stage credit 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.250
 and yes the formation has a player in 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.829
 3-4-1-2 will not sell as expensive 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.719
 than a player in 4 1 2 1 2 so who 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.009
 to resort to the players who are in 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:08.319
 training enough how to say recurring 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.560
 players like to play 4-4-2 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.180
 80 hours of 4-3-3 4-2-3-1 and so on 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.819
 rather than 5 3 2 or 4 3 3 in 3-4-3 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.680
 pardon so that's it if you see by 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.299
 example one year m go we will take a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.209
 concrete example of the same cabaye cost 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.360
 about 2000 credit in 3-4-3 if you 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.030
 see in 3-4-3 1800 credit that is only used to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.129
 nothing you will earn 200 credit it's not 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.680
 necessarily a good plan while if you 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.299
 find me at 2000 credit of 1500 credit 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.130
 in 4-4-2 because he will resell himself 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.720
 much more expensive in 4-4-2 up to 5000 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.519
 credit do not hesitate to take it 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.220
 so be careful about that 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.049
 formations are very important 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.130
 step number 4 the auctions for 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.720
 make good business 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.370
 you do not have to connect during 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.310
 rush hours finally unless you have 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.170
 a chance of unimaginable cuckold rather 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.609
 it's better to connect during 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.030
 night sessions 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.340
 such 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.540
 time zones like for example 2 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.100
 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.380
 it's perfect for them to 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.490
 the purchase resales the dudes they are 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.930
 fuck they just opened their stadium 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.190
 who will launch days at 150 and that's 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.670
 possible to fall on very very 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.090
 good deals 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.030
 it happened to me especially to fall on 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.840
 on an admitted credit rush and that's it 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.130
 really happy 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.650
 so here I pray you city ​​y 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.130
 favor the players of the schedules 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.770
 late 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.360
 like one in the morning 6am 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.160
 for fo sees there too you can not 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.610
 so that's a technique for them 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.140
 late night 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.019
 or so in the hollow moments of the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.930
 day is it an hour after 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.790
 noon until 4 am step number 5 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.320
 have patience and yes the purchase 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.390
 resale requires a lot of patience 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.769
 especially for step number 2 the whose 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.470
 I was talking about the alley of the techniques 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.950
 of the immediate purchase and well do not hesitate 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.569
 not to hammer y or triangle for them 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.330
 narrow techniques just one day 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.769
 appear and then there patience goes 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.190
 have to quickly turn it into fast 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.900
 in execution and do not hesitate to fast 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.160
 buy attention not to crack either 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.380
 his underwear and buy a player by 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.260
 example in 5-3-2 so that could 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.630
 win as his credit step number 6 and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.190
 not least the stage of the sale 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.049
 so first know that hay 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.480
 test 5% of the sale of a player 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.970
 ie a player for example sold 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.850
 2000 credit will bring you 1,900 credit 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.940
 why 5% on 2000 sagging credit 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 so me 2000 - without that, think about it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.490
 be careful when you put your 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.220
 player for sale at 7 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.690
 this tax paid because for 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.070
 players or you resell very very expensive 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.680
 for example you take a cristiano 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.120
 ronaldo 500000 credit finally has the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.560
 5% it will make a lot of credit 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.700
 attention the purchase resale on the big ones 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.650
 players it's very risky 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.900
 that's why it's better to try to 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.660
 buying resale on players a little 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.060
 learned honorable kinds between 1000 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.970
 credits and 50000 credit after the purchase 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.320
 resale becomes harder then down 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.330
 when you put your days on sale 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.440
 be reasonable do not try prices 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.039
 mirobolant otherwise your players do not 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.990
 not leave this fact well and good 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.970
 gaffe 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.470
 otherwise it's time wasted and time 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.450
 in less to make the charge between 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.740
 think about it 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.190
 step number 7 and that's more of a 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.450
 advice know how to save 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.980
 it's not because you're twenty 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.330
 a thousand credit that must be said is that the 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.380
 expenses and unless your team of 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.440
 dream costs twenty thousand credis 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.450
 would surprise me to know how to save for 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.250
 do more resale buying since more 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.900
 money is equal to more purchase 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.210
 resale was guys out more

 quickly very quickly mounted look at me 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680
 I will take the example myself 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.540
 I started I opened the four 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.880
 beginning paws I was five thousand 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.690
 credit is good I'm done a few 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.600
 matches slept ch 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.740
 but I still have it all with 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.800

 even relatively important 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.850
 step number 8 a little bonus of my 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.890
 share their hives from coyote 2 and dolto 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.510
 and if the purchase resales on the jerseys 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.160
 Mexican and Deir primeira liga 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.590
 some jerseys will go up to 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.910
 nearly 3000 credit I advise you 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.010
 also the jerseys of the seattle sounders 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.150
 where there is written xbox on for them 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.700
 xbox players i do not know it works 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.040
 same for ps3 players but there is 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.900
 really way to make a lot of buying 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.060

 credit and resell them at 2500 credit 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.500

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.520
 here we go then chained on 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.470
 The final word 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.730
 the resale purchase is rather complicated 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.919
 especially when it's not about it 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.780
