00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 I am fabrice from the mmo youtube team and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.760
 I have the new assassin's this time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.130
 creed unity looked a little closer and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 I hereby present the mmo gameplay 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.759
 test as always I want later 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.940
 Avoid and therefore go only group of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 history 1 is through the so-called helix 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.689
 It is possible for us in every event 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 every epoch on every part of the earth too 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 slip on information and the like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.849
 to collect more about the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 to experience human history 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 we have the order as arno doria and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.149
 to join the assassins to the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 true forces to uncover the behind the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 stuck in the French revolution 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.309
 so much for the story but we come to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.210
 another important point 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.010
 Gameplay The gameplay does not matter either 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.750
 with controller or mouse and keyboard 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180
 the controls are kept simple 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 and also suitable for beginners 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 however, it is just climbing 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.590
 sometimes quite inaccurate around in one 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.360
 I need that window to rise 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 often several attempts that quite 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 I can just happen 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 beyond that swing 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.690
 Trivia makes climbing though 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 a lot of fun 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.539
 especially because there is no level 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 You can really limit yourself 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 wherever you want i still have 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 I have not experienced that somewhere 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 came on because me the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.250
 climbing possibilities were missing 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 if it is on one side of the house 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.580
 or the cathedral anymore 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.619
 then you go on trying it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 the other side of the building the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.350
 fighting situations are also right 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.070
 are kept simple but still 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 not without 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.790
 we can only attack and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 Blocking does not sound very fun 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.299
 but if the life of a 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.159
 We have to light up the opponent 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 parrying we make this too late 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.920
 we catch ourselves a cut down of yet 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 hurts a lot 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 especially with several opponents this is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.200
 a challenge 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 In addition to the melee weapons we can 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.320
 but still at an arsenal of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.880
 ranged weapons the east and pistols 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.409
 serve and bomb various bombs with us 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 to lead 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.570
 Of course, they are again 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.399
 well-known hidden sound at the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.450
 start with which we just one after 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210
 the other from the ambush 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 can turn off 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.030
 apropos ambush there is still one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.130
 sleep system that he hitman 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.899
 Absolution reminds us when we are in one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.759
 Locked zone feels like one 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.439
 Display if we are not fast enough 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.939
 the field of vision of the person coming discovered 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.500
 they get us and we get displayed where 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.740
 she has staggered us once seen it 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.119
 we know where to search about for us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.140
 damir hitman absolution very much liked 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.619
 I find the same system in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.210
 order 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.450
 however, the ki is sometimes pretty 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.580
 well I do not want to say it stupid though 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.570
 somehow 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.010
 but what do we already have that 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.540
 to do all day in Paris 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.070
 Well, there is a lot to discover 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.630
 and to do besides the 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.580
 There are lots of missions beside 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.500
 Determine which one from pretty dull as kill 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.620
 the ideas to headaches in 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.880
 puzzles as murder explanations vary 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.530
 crates are everywhere and collect 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.240
 stretcher objects but which hides on 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.620
 the map will be displayed when we get on 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.270
 Climb the viewpoints and the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.370
 synchronize corresponding area 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.330
 We all know that from everyone 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.520
 play ubisoft 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.350
 It may happen that we happen to 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.300
 witness to a murder or theft 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.160
 will and can overwhelm the offender 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.480
 What us a few more times for example 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.530
 unlock new garments 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.940
 so much for the gameplay but what does that have 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.390
 new assassin's creed the technically too 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.910
 Offer 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 and right now it starts getting painful 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.870
 the technology is the big one 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.700
 the weak point of the game as it is called 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.280
 beautiful everything has a hook and in 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.630
 a pretty big one in this case 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.790
 pretty much everyone has tremendous performance 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.200
 problems which even on the consoles 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.030
 should be very critical 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.410
 Let's face assassin's 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.330
 creed unity is not yet 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.770
 finished optimizing the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.130
 developers still screw something else 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.380
 can 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.060
 ubisoft has already acknowledged that there 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.770
 much work is still to come 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.050
 anyway, day one patch directly new 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.090
 patches announced next to iding 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.900
 clips and graphics errors the performance 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.910
 to improve 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.740
 also I have massive problems with the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.280
 play and I really do not have it now 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.290
 just the worst calculator 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.910
 But I'm a fair human and 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.490
 press for the disaster of hot stocks 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.640
 one last time both eyes closed and 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.020
 do not go on the problems 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.090
 and if you except the performance times 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.890
 It's easy to be aware of this 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.900
 game looks damn good 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.730
 even at the lowest settings 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.560
 it is still very vivid as 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.150
 owns a nvidia graphics card 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 even benefits twice as much as it is 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.660
 Some nvidia technologies contain the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.160
 on request and if enough 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.630
 enable computing power and 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.340
 more beautiful shade or a better one 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.590
 to be able to enjoy the environment 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 but as I said even if not quite 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.530
 so much steam under the hood can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.769
 enjoy the game even without the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.060
 extras one augenschmaus is creating the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.440
 the graphics alone are a good one 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.079
 atmosphere 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.270
 I say, of course, especially the one 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.190
 he contributes in detail to the 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.380
 magnificently furnished princely houses 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
 with ornate gold trains very much 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.890
 authentic churches and cathedrals the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.840
 are also very nicely decorated 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.340
 and of course the normal cottages of the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.360
 Underlay only the most necessary 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.580
 are equipped 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.080
 oh yes, since we are at the cottage so 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.450
 good as all homes and buildings are 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.740
 accessible to all the people 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.330
 either just comfortably over the market 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.890
 stroll or become a crowd 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.779
 gather around on the barricades 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.249
 go 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.990
 to that comes the good sound of the people 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.909
 speak french no matter what language 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.889
 We have chosen not to worry 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.309
 Of course, all important people talk 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.439
 German 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.759
 but if you just so in paris around 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.650
 Spirit actually only becomes one 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.360
 French language which I am very good 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.050
 find 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.939
 apart from that, the German 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.749
 Synchronization even for once 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.249
 really good 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.689
 I have not had a game for a long time 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.729
 played that good German 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.150
 Synchro half time it was breaking me that 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.029
 heart 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.550
 olivier I would not be here who would 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:21.409
 then hurt your work and strive for it 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.409
 Horses lad to work 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.009
 if there is something in it 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.069
 Assassin's creed unity is lacking 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.330
 It certainly is not atmosphere 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.879
 I think so slowly it is time for 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.800
 my conclusion in my opinion is 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.749
 assassin's creed unity a really good one 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.460
 play that from the beginning as it knows the 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:39.719
 player in the spell attracts above all 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.610
 because of the excellent atmosphere 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.839
 Do you want the living paris 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.990
 never leave again 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.860
 the story is solid in my eyes 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.930
 Goose bumps are rare 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.759
 up but not many facets outdated 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.319
 For example, the story is on 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.939
 us also in paris at the end of the 19 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.439
 century or even occupied 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.169
 paris in the second world war 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.580
 so is provided for a lot of variety whom 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.199
 but that is not enough he will be his 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.449
 Variation in the countless next to 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.560
 All people like the orders 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.060
 interact with your friends 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.770
 come to their cost the 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.749
 There are various missions with the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.069
 to work off to three other players 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.779
 are 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.759
 what should I say big it is 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.379
 unity would have devoured me completely 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.639
 if these performance problems me 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.149
 no way through the bill 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.949
 had 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:22.199
 however, in the near future 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.629
 which I strongly assume 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.129
 then the game has big chances with that
