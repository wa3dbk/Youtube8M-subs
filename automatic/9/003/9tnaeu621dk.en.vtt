of fun stuff so I read it cover to cover

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.880 
of fun stuff so I read it cover to cover
right<00:01:07.680> after<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.010> first<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.320> not<00:01:10.320> stopping

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
right after I first got it not stopping

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.539 
right after I first got it not stopping
for<00:01:10.920> anything<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.460> reading<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.549> hoping

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
for anything just reading it and hoping

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.200 
for anything just reading it and hoping
that<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.280> developing<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.850> guess<00:01:18.030> some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that it just developing I guess some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.560 
that it just developing I guess some
muscle<00:01:18.509> memory<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> maybe<00:01:20.700> stuff<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
muscle memory so that maybe stuff would

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
muscle memory so that maybe stuff would
seem<00:01:21.780> familiar<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.920> went<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.369> read

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
seem familiar when I went back and read

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.730 
seem familiar when I went back and read
it<00:01:23.729> again<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.830> started<00:01:26.400> reading<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it again so then I started reading it a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.789 
it again so then I started reading it a
second<00:01:28.740> time<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:30.049> stopping<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
second time and stopping to look up a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.899 
second time and stopping to look up a
bunch<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> stuff<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.520> didn't<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.790> what

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
bunch of stuff that I didn't know what

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
bunch of stuff that I didn't know what
it<00:01:33.000> meant<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:37.079> got<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:37.860> frustrated

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it meant so I got a little frustrated

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
it meant so I got a little frustrated
with<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.320> didn't

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
with that because it was like I didn't

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.940 
with that because it was like I didn't
know<00:01:40.799> anything<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.409> stuck<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
know anything but you know I stuck with

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.609 
know anything but you know I stuck with
it<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.820> been<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.299> slow<00:01:45.990> process

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it it's just been a really slow process

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
it it's just been a really slow process
of<00:01:46.829> looking<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.729> bunch<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> stuff<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.479> don't

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
of looking up a bunch of stuff I don't

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.700 
of looking up a bunch of stuff I don't
know<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.210> thought<00:01:51.479> maybe<00:01:51.810> I'll<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.500> use

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
know then I thought maybe I'll just use

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
know then I thought maybe I'll just use
the<00:01:52.890> book<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:55.159> reference<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:57.090> try<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the book for reference and not try to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
the book for reference and not try to
learn<00:01:57.689> everything<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.159> even<00:01:59.219> know

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
learn everything but I don't even know

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
learn everything but I don't even know
what<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.479> still<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
what I don't know so I still want it to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
what I don't know so I still want it to
stick<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.759> lending<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.180> bunch<00:02:03.360> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
stick with just lending a bunch of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.440 
stick with just lending a bunch of
random<00:02:03.869> terms<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.939> don't<00:02:05.939> expect<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.360> be

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
random terms in it I don't expect to be

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
random terms in it I don't expect to be
able<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.780> everything<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.119> I'd

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
able to do everything in here but I'd

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780 
able to do everything in here but I'd
like<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.679> least<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.280> an<00:02:11.400> understanding

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
like to at least have an understanding

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.589 
like to at least have an understanding
of<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.209> couple<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.690> things

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
of a couple of things

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.809 
of a couple of things
so<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:16.129> guess<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.959> couple<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.019> chapters<00:02:19.290> in

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
so I guess I was a couple of chapters in

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.600 
so I guess I was a couple of chapters in
when<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.800> realized<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.920> might<00:02:22.950> need<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.550> some

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
when I realized I might need to do some

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
when I realized I might need to do some
preventative<00:02:24.000> maintenance<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.620> put

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
preventative maintenance to it and I put

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.470 
preventative maintenance to it and I put
it<00:02:26.160> has<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:27.800> handy<00:02:29.239> lubrication<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it has this handy lubrication and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.009 
it has this handy lubrication and
maintenance<00:02:30.959> section<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.549> i<00:02:32.970> think<00:02:33.450> i<00:02:33.810> might

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
maintenance section so i think i might

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.570 
maintenance section so i think i might
try<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> couple<00:02:35.010> things<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.400> that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
try to do a couple things in that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.220 
try to do a couple things in that
