00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
think that maybe they weren't his

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.930 
think that maybe they weren't his
experiences<00:04:59.720> we<00:04:59.870> were<00:05:00.020> or<00:05:00.290> something<00:05:00.620> because

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
experiences we were or something because

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.180 
experiences we were or something because
it<00:05:01.940> was<00:05:02.060> kind<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.300> lopsided<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:03.350> liked<00:05:03.770> our<00:05:03.920> odds

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
it was kind of lopsided I liked our odds

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.920 
it was kind of lopsided I liked our odds
in<00:05:04.550> winning<00:05:04.910> games<00:05:05.120> two<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.360> three<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.810> we

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
in winning games two and three so we

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.450 
in winning games two and three so we
were<00:05:06.020> more<00:05:06.200> than<00:05:06.260> happy<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.800> be<00:05:06.890> able<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.310> keep

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
were more than happy to be able to keep

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.640 
were more than happy to be able to keep
playing<00:05:07.760> but<00:05:08.030> they<00:05:08.690> were<00:05:08.750> not<00:05:09.080> interested<00:05:09.350> in

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
playing but they were not interested in

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.290 
playing but they were not interested in
it<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.430> how<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.670> went<00:05:10.760> down<00:05:10.850> they

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300
