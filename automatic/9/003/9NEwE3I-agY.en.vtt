00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
for vitamin c that's the only thing it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.420 
for vitamin c that's the only thing it
doesn't<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:41.349> little<00:02:42.349> more<00:02:42.620> juice<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.280> make

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
doesn't have a little more juice to make

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.220 
doesn't have a little more juice to make
this<00:02:43.610> plan

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.200 

alright<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.890> let<00:02:49.160> me<00:02:49.250> get<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.430> blend<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.000> down

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
alright so let me get this blend it down

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.630 
alright so let me get this blend it down
and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:50.630> we'll<00:02:51.440> worry<00:02:51.620> about<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.830> flex<00:02:52.190> it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and then we'll worry about the flex it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.820 
and then we'll worry about the flex it
is<00:02:52.730> annoying<00:02:53.270> because<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:54.260> would<00:02:54.410> notice<00:02:54.680> we're

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
is annoying because I would notice we're

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.680 
is annoying because I would notice we're
using<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.220> blender<00:02:55.670> instead<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.300> juicer

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
using a blender instead of a juicer

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.360 
using a blender instead of a juicer
because<00:02:56.870> we're<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.740> concepts<00:02:58.220> of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
because we're going with the concepts of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.360 
because we're going with the concepts of
whole<00:02:58.640> foods<00:02:59.060> yeah<00:02:59.740> when<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:01.040> when<00:03:01.280> you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
whole foods yeah when you do when you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.670 
whole foods yeah when you do when you
juice<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.820> leave<00:03:02.030> behind<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.110> pulp<00:03:03.380> and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
juice you leave behind the pulp and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.890 
juice you leave behind the pulp and
that's<00:03:04.670> going<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.880> be<00:03:04.970> good<00:03:05.000> if<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.630> want<00:03:05.810> to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
that's going to be good if you want to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.980 
that's going to be good if you want to
get<00:03:06.020> fiber<00:03:06.260> into<00:03:06.560> your<00:03:06.590> diet<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:08.390> know<00:03:08.690> just

Fleck<00:03:52.130> see<00:03:52.660> what<00:03:53.660> I've<00:03:53.780> heard<00:03:54.050> is<00:03:54.380> better<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
Fleck see what I've heard is better to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.920 
Fleck see what I've heard is better to
do<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.460> whole<00:03:55.670> scene<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.450> let<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.630> soak

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
do the whole scene and let it soak

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.140 
do the whole scene and let it soak
overnight<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.650> it'll<00:03:57.830> get<00:03:57.980> soft<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.030> you

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
overnight so it'll get soft and then you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.550 
overnight so it'll get soft and then you
can<00:03:59.300> put<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.630> your<00:03:59.750> smoothies<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.410> look

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
great the seat apart otherwise we won't

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.430

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
does have to soak if it's a whole seat

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.790 
does have to soak if it's a whole seat
but<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.240> meal<00:04:11.480> okay<00:04:12.440> here<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:12.709> go
