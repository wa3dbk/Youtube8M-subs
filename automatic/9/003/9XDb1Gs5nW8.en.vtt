00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 i 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.930
 very good this is a video for the 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.780
 channel of a boxing and reviews of pc box 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.340
 on youtube and today we bring you a keyboard 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.320
 special is the logitech g105 os 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.449
 we will show the contents of the box the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.700
 characteristics we will teach you at 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.170
 keyboard we will do a boxing and a little 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.880
 of review 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.880
 let's proceed to boxing 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.510
 At first glance we see the keyboard 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.510
 covered in a plastic to protect it 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.290
 content of the box we see that it is the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:59.050
 typical quick start manual the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.050
 guarantees and a small flyer 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.380
 ah 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.530
 let's see if it's packed, you have to break it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530
 the plastic 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
 well one of the first things that 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.490
 they draw attention is that below 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.230
 have such a striking red color is a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 Garnet red we see that it weighs pretty much what 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.560
 that assures us enough fixation we see 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.750
 that the keys are like a little 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.060
 matte tone 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.660
 has the macro keys to the left 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:46.360
 six macro keys configurable the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.360
 which are I chose bless x 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.300
 profile we have 1 on 2 and 3 what 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 gives us a total of 18 macro keys 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.060
 new that has a specific button 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.930
 for configurable game mode through 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 of the software 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.350
 we see the gaming keys that are in a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 very attractive silver tone very 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.490
 striking and now plugging it we have for 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.850
 that you see the backlighting that 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.850
 It includes 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.130
 the keys are membrane but achieving 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.890
 a very nice touch 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.890
 with not much to envy a mechanic 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.959
 we can turn it off 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.260
 we will turn off the light so you can see it 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.260
 best 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.359
 we can select the low intensity 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.359
