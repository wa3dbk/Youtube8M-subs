00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 because they were so waiting for the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.650
 mica to see led flash comes with 12 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 colors and can use it to scream 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.320
 halloween stop to Paris on 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 colors are called equal 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.609
 the same color the same amount when 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.310
 drown the only thing you're going to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.550
 notice 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.190
 is that the palette above and those of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.670
 down there are more rights when we 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 flip the palette is equal see these two 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 pallets are going to think 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 what is the same company are exactly 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.370
 the same colors the ria de riva 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.370
 it's from this brand 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.489
 is the flash below is also left 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 last the two 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 and the label is very different from below 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.369
 because I think they come from the same 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.100
 company when I was little 1 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.369
 advice is not bad teenager and another for 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 a company of bundles and we already recorded the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.830
 boxes of bundles and we remove the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.520
 china labels and we put them 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.240
 economic labels that in that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.479
 then it was that martins in california 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 it was that marc but they lived in it 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.030
 same camacho that I follow a long time 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.970

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.929
 ebay and hit on this palette when she 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.659
 gave with this palette said this brand there is 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.439
 plus 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.929
 when she received her palette she 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.380
 grabbed the makerbot greece that already said in 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.619
 her video that she did not have the medical 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.350
 to see but that you have tested it in 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.229
 it assumes a lot of led and that I felt it was 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.539
 exactly identical I told her 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.720
 in a comment that I followed had just 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.340
 buy the mica pay off flash cable 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.370
 of 12 law that I could do that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.709
 comparison and I was going to order to see if 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.180
 it was my turn to say to myself that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.900
 forever and not me did not come to me like that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.269
 I got so lucky that the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.480
 acidity and america by mistake and mine not 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.690
 there is nothing there is nothing different in a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.660
 palette york unlike is that this 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 is not I figure that it did not happen 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.519
 inspection by the curved and companies 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.640
 as in so much for these words are 100 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.130
 dollars if you do not have a disc they charge you 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.140
 100 dollars for this palette like me 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 I have the best green change 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.610
 50 or 40 less this palette looks so 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.850
 curved one stand more short others 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.520
 they are higher and that what to me 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.430
 does and because of my experience in working in 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.110
 Bacteria bills for cruise me 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:21.810
 It makes you think that they did not pass ex wait 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.670
 inspection pay like 13 dollars and 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.120
 richetti is almost free you are paying 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 almost by shipping by the pallet alone without 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.540
 product you get for 12 15 dollars 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.569
 the conversion and that yourselves if 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.909
 they have this palette they can order this and 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.489
 yourselves see it for yourselves if 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.829
 you do not have this palette and you say no 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.260

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.080
 cable 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:15.000
 when you apply it the color is the same no 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:18.709
