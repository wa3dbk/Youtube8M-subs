computer<00:03:15.180> intelligence<00:03:16.200> artificial

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
computer intelligence artificial

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.500 
computer intelligence artificial
intelligence<00:03:17.980> by<00:03:18.160> computers<00:03:18.639> was<00:03:19.090> not<00:03:19.269> really

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
intelligence by computers was not really

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.400 
intelligence by computers was not really
evolved<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.829> basically<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:24.810> play<00:03:25.810> against<00:03:26.169> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
evolved so basically you play against a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.129 
evolved so basically you play against a
computer<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:27.069> just<00:03:27.099> goes<00:03:28.019> pretty<00:03:29.019> much

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
computer that just goes pretty much

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.099 
computer that just goes pretty much
randomly<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.069> choosing<00:03:30.579> letters<00:03:30.910> when<00:03:31.389> it's

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
randomly and choosing letters when it's

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.449 
randomly and choosing letters when it's
is<00:03:32.410> turn<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.950> spin<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:35.130> choose<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> letter

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
is turn to spin and to choose a letter

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.879 
is turn to spin and to choose a letter
and<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:37.000> phrase<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.930> too<00:03:41.200> many<00:03:41.319> letters

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
and a phrase but when too many letters

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.309 
and a phrase but when too many letters
are<00:03:42.250> actually<00:03:42.690> there<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.500> computer<00:03:44.739> will

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
are actually there the computer will

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.250 
are actually there the computer will
pretty<00:03:47.319> fast<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:49.150> know<00:03:49.269> it's<00:03:49.900> not<00:03:50.019> going<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
pretty fast you know it's not going to

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.539 
pretty fast you know it's not going to
take<00:03:50.349> a<00:03:50.379> long<00:03:50.620> time<00:03:50.829> before<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.219> computer

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
take a long time before the computer

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.740 
take a long time before the computer
finds<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.420> answer

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
finds the answer

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.790 
finds the answer
old<00:03:52.870> friends<00:03:53.320> so<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.790> still<00:03:54.790> have<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.620> know<00:03:56.680> a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
say even with the computer but of course

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.470

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
points I never never never seen so I

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
points I never never never seen so I
don't<00:05:44.650> know<00:05:44.710> how<00:05:44.860> many<00:05:45.270> phrases<00:05:46.979> they've<00:05:47.979> put

don't know how many phrases they've put
in<00:05:48.729> this<00:05:49.060> game<00:05:49.440> but<00:05:50.910> it's<00:05:51.910> really<00:05:52.540> really

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
in this game but it's really really

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.380 
in this game but it's really really
amazing<00:05:53.470> at<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.790> fact<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.120> I've<00:05:55.360> never

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
amazing at the fact that I've never

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.900 
amazing at the fact that I've never
never<00:05:55.930> actually<00:05:56.229> seen<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.370> same<00:05:57.640> phrase

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
never actually seen the same phrase

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.840
