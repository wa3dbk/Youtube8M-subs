00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 read more Book of the week again 2 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.479
 I have helped with the 500 pages week they are through today what can 

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:20.239
 Is small 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.009
 funny 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.069
 our Federal Republic was in May 1949 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.050
 raised from baptism 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.029
 and in 1990 extended by 5 from German countries 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.879
 they know that it is a federal matter 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.980
 be a man with a schoolchild in another state and they want 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.820
 to hang oneself 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.310
 that means we are 16 federal states 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.200
 and then we have to ask ourselves the honest way sometimes too 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.950
 we need them all 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.610
 we want the all 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.270
 we all really like that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.479
 the answer is 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:50.570
 No 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.890
 at least say that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.299
 Michael brother Ralf and Jürgen Roth 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.980
 in this little bitter tract 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.860
 shrinking 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 the Federal Republic of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 "I have to wait and see, these are satirists who sometimes work 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.309
 for Titanic 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.990
 and they ask themselves in this book 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.350
 what are those only for people Weier Saxony Hesse 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.940
 does it have to be that way 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.320
 we do not want to like the whole thing a bit warmer 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 a steam 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 a calendar debauched whole country a little so shrink 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 even with, for example, the Swabians probably not really 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.810
 and they already notice who likes to have politically correct the lies with 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.220
 This book is completely wrong 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.210
 but who likes to be in Thailand 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.180
 viciously unimportant 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.400
 Has advantages 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.270
 this reinforces this book 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.420
 and promptly in how to put whole states out of siding 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.430
 or let's get started now so in detail 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.130
 the exuberant Gera became the Hesse 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.920
 how do they talk because it must be over and the food the dapd 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.580
 none of what you in Hesse is really enjoyable Handke is 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.250
 He reported them to Roland Koch of the entire 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.880
 or the Saxons of this finest strip of earth from slate sandstone and garbage 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.109
 a people of completely incomprehensible speaks lukewarm coffee drinking Sydow 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.479
 build deficient fun pools 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.939
 and people who are the princes Gunther Emmerlich from Saxony 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.850
 Saxony becomes the Balkans we do not need Bavaria 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.180
 Actually I was married to a lawyer but ultimately it comes down 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.219
 to people 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.880
 Rotten meat exporters 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.580
 Komödienstadel Ottfried Fischer Véronique Affaires the Islanders Bavaria 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.500
 but the league never let you read a Solingen potato queen but she is there 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 as a Bavarian 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.730
 Lederhosen 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.849
 one drinks we laughed tons one calls the measure 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.999
 a Bavarian saying to life is 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:39.389
 if it's time rewards next to Na if's because Sasha point he is time to visit 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.319
 it does not even need to remember

 Bayern Munich

 Ratzinger now also his with this country 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.679
 the Swabians for heaven's sake no 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.189
 that she gave the home builders the polished ones 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.029
 Care weeks inventors hunter fence experts people who appoint the town 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.150

 Mauritanian 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.089
 these are people who have bellybutton Pirson at the same time and 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.730
 wearing birkenstock sandals 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.860
 the first Black Forest cake and evenings do not want his art life 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.460
 we do not need that at all 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.209
 The authors suggest that the Swabians are so stingy 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.619
 on the highways tolls of three billion and those left in the 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.930
 he land and will have to go home never to see them again 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450
 is that nice that you still know her 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.509
 Franconia absolutely unbearable 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.799
 stolen by the Bavarians, they are beguiled by the Thuringians 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.939
 Hesse case 8 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.580
 ripped off the citizens 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.289
 and kept by the Swabians for Bavaria anyway 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.589
 So the Franks are people who live in gingerbread houses 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.699
 which were built by the mail order 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.879
 Per cent these are the wellness hiking trails the Franks have invented 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.549
 are usually already drunk with that but then it starts right 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.780
 or the Saarlanders 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.770
 I mean the Saarland he used to belong to France that was nice Sony 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.580
 that take back or we knock the Saarland to Luxembourg 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.959
 Hansi seen my cities like Saarbrücken Saarlouis or Homburg 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.450
 the Saar that looks like Uzbekistan and what people come for 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.369
 because from there on 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.809
 Lafontaine 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.930
 % 1 PCK Honeck Otmar Saarlander 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.210
 what they do not churches

 His English also adds a schnapps 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.980
 Saarland really is the Sahara 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.549
 he will and a dictaphone pig waste from Bavaria grilling the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.680
 Percent potatoes from China then his geese liver cirrhosis sausage the seniors

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.140
 and then eat them well, we say so clearly 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.769
 I am from North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.110
 the Rhinelanders are the very last ones who can not carry the rain 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.389
 fast as I do in the dozens all 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.170
 Percent the political parties are here but what you can not do 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.770
 really call politics 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.009
 Hermann is her pig's thigh in Cologne cathedral size and then something diarrhea 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.450
 Colors is with raisins 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.300
 this is called Rheinischer Sauerbraten Emden 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.680
 in the carnival time everything is back from PTFE Athens 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.550
 up to the last drop she is bad and no real beer 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.490
 as in Bavaria then you have to drink these containers here you step out 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.760
 Test tubes give her a born liquid thats dazzling yet 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.900
 annoying when the glass is empty says Matter waitress Liebeleien 2 not 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.629
 No 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.490
 We do not need that at all 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.839
 The authors suggest their depressing research 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.939
 Check thoroughly 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.159
 no country 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.259
 inside then should be in the Federal Republic or not whether, for example, Palatine 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.559
 Finally, wines are basically breaking any law I would say yes 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.699
 Obliging forgotten land must then be removed by court order from the Federation 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.080
 will be back in there if you want to see a form there 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.699
 to fill in why you no longer have which country in the Federal Republic 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:28.300
 would like to 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.200
 if there are less than three countries just using the Federal Republic simply 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.300
 that's how easy it is 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.059
 So if you really want to be the biggest at the next Stammtisch 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:39.789
 Here they are helped 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.789
 until the next book of voters in these cities 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.539
 this book is shrinking the Federal Republic 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.199
 does not exist in the normal book trade that exists only in the specialties of 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.050
 2001
