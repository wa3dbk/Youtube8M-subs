How to solve laptop charging problem !

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:29.383
the motherboard does not charging only works with the battery

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:44.768
always voltage with battery

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.269
connect the ad dc now

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.766
dc voltage not resident on circuits

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.145
no voltage in all circuit from ad

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:06.177
remove all this plastic parts

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:13.076
You must check all the controll ics linked with the src circuit ..

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:33.322
now check this ic if connected with the src mosfet

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.130
this ic connected with adpsw circuit

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:56.255
We must change now

00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:17.924
new ic

00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:43.862
now voltage is normal

00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.441
check the src mosfet now

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.414
worked

00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:02.144
all circuit now connected with adp ( can charging now )

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.189
re-install the pieces

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:14.266
charging led and adp connect led light now

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:24.283
test the motherboard with adp only

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560
worked now

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.334
now connect the battery

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:40.205
charging ok

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.840
now remove the adp only work with battery

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:49.803
remove the battery

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.529
solved :)
