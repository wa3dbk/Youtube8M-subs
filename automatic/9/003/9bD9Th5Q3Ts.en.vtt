00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.980
 we look at came to the exhibition and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.789
 driver coupon held in Gelendzhik 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.779
 arrived for three where is the plane 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 exposure and seasoning he asked 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.869
 control photographed and literally 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.660
 as soon as we move away there was a website 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.100
 military helicopters and know the helicopter 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.640
 who flew with Vlad Russia he flag 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 put on the ground 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 dropped and when attempting to land 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 something happened abnormal situation 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 the deterioration helicopter was extremely difficult 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.210
 get with the choir because the absolute 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 unorganized were about the project 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 respectively, soon had time that is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.149
 urgently 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 took away the affected pilots fire 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 eliminated the kind of injured gis 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.640
 There are no visitors for sales to the question. 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.470
 I still have to you, but it is possible that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.390
 a strong wind caused the crash 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.070
 the helicopter is really windy at you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 there the forces are actually kind of choppy 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 maybe it's the wind that causes the time he 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 that is, then it is not these as long as anyone 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.930
 kutab clouds then there is such a situation 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.810
 maybe this is the reason either from me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.369
 incoming wind flow 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.170
 other aircraft took off the air 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.659
 nevertheless landed safely in 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.540
 Within Anya Salon Of course, I already 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.850
 i 'm at the day 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.680
 the third day is flying airplanes 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.619
 training on the flight all right 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.520
 everything is possible without any problems 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.369
 machinery faulty passenger cars 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 and say here's how visitors to the air show 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.820
 on an event program like this 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.290
 affected the food continue activities 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 I have a parable here planned for 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.030
 reading areas will be a lot of them can 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.659
 say but i think the event is not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 cover their pimple's head should be 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.099
 I think not much impact she gets 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.069
 that no storm warning 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.540
 there due to the sharp deterioration of the weather not 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.390
 was yes that is a pilot nobody 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.849
 forbade to take off that's exactly marked 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.610
 due to weather conditions 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.709
 Guitar monuments did not look but really 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.930
 fact read and which is from that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.470
 expected to scratch the weather that is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.780
 deadwood but gusty wind will carry 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.549
