to do will not only change but also add
on<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.360> rounds<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.980> real<00:00:47.190> quick<00:00:47.219> we'll

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
on as rounds go on so real quick we'll

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.500 
on as rounds go on so real quick we'll
take<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> look<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.180> inside<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
take a look at what you get inside of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
take a look at what you get inside of
this<00:00:48.570> box<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> how<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> game<00:00:49.410> plays<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.980> then

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this box and how the game plays and then

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.439 
this box and how the game plays and then
we'll<00:00:50.430> come<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.120> final

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
we'll come back here and get my final

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.500 
we'll come back here and get my final
opinion<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.899> bits<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.149> one

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
opinion on bits so here you can see one

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
opinion on bits so here you can see one
of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> trays<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> setups<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:55.949> bits<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of the trays and setups for bits now the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
of the trays and setups for bits now the
reason<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> can't<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> pieces

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
reason I you can't see all the pieces

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
reason I you can't see all the pieces
yet<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.039> wanted<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> show<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
yet is because I wanted to show the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760 
yet is because I wanted to show the
storage<00:01:00.120> solution<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.719> inside<00:01:01.170> each<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
storage solution here inside each one of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.990 
storage solution here inside each one of
these<00:01:01.890> trays<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.520> four<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> them

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
these trays and there are four of them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
these trays and there are four of them
for<00:01:03.300> each<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> four<00:01:03.780> players<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.619> little

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
for each of the four players is a little

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
for each of the four players is a little
slot<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.489> holding<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.240> little

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
slot for holding all of your little

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730 
slot for holding all of your little
pieces<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.350> tiling

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pieces that you're going to be tiling

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
pieces that you're going to be tiling
together<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.700> I'll<00:01:09.180> take<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
together so I'll take these out but you

together so I'll take these out but you
can<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.710> they<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:10.950> fit<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.250> very

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
can see they all fit in there very

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060 
can see they all fit in there very
nicely<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.510> coated<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.680> only<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
nicely they are coated not only with the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.109 
nicely they are coated not only with the
colors<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> look<00:01:14.700> down<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:14.880> you'll

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
colors but if you look down here you'll

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.399 
colors but if you look down here you'll
see<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> triangle<00:01:16.170> which

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
see that this one is a triangle which

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
see that this one is a triangle which
means<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> triangle<00:01:17.369> player<00:01:17.460> each

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
means it's for the triangle player each

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
means it's for the triangle player each
player<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.360> their<00:01:18.630> own<00:01:18.689> set<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.049> pieces<00:01:19.560> with

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
player has their own set of pieces with

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
player has their own set of pieces with
their<00:01:20.070> own<00:01:20.159> shape<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.450> basically

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
their own shape on it but basically

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
their own shape on it but basically
inside<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.860> hold<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
inside of this you can hold all of the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
inside of this you can hold all of the
different<00:01:23.759> pieces<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:24.960> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
different pieces which you will be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
different pieces which you will be
needing<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> play<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> game<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

basically you're going to be trying to
make<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:33.000> shapes<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.600> order<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> score

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
make different shapes in order to score

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.300 
make different shapes in order to score
points<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.710> shapes<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> either<00:01:35.130> going

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
points and those shapes are either going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
points and those shapes are either going
to<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.180> certain<00:01:36.299> size<00:01:36.710> or<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to have to be of a certain size or of a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.140 
to have to be of a certain size or of a
certain<00:01:38.189> color<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.640> both<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.790> basically<00:01:41.790> at

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
certain color or both so basically at

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.219 
certain color or both so basically at
the<00:01:42.270> beginning<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> game<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:43.079> going

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the beginning of the game you're going

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
the beginning of the game you're going
to<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.439> dealt<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.310> starter<00:01:44.850> tile

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to get dealt one of these starter tile

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
to get dealt one of these starter tile
things<00:01:45.630> you'll<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.500> looks<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> for

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
things you'll see it looks like this for

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.530 
things you'll see it looks like this for
example<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.430> player<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> black

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
example this player would get the black

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
example this player would get the black
and<00:01:48.840> blue<00:01:49.170> tile<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.740> start<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.729> take

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and blue tile to start and they take

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
and blue tile to start and they take
that<00:01:50.970> starter<00:01:51.450> tile<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.500> place

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that starter tile and they would place

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
that starter tile and they would place
it<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.979> their<00:01:53.189> board<00:01:53.460> somehow<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.720> what

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it on their board somehow now what

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.209 
it on their board somehow now what
they're<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> find<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:56.040> shortly

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
they're going to find out shortly

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.880 
they're going to find out shortly
thereafter<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.200> goal<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
thereafter is what the goal is for this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.959 
thereafter is what the goal is for this
round<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> place<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.759> out

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
round so we're going to place this out

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.149 
round so we're going to place this out
maybe<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.299> wanted<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> start<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
maybe they wanted to start like this and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.620 
maybe they wanted to start like this and
they<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.430> flip<00:02:02.640> over<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.060> first<00:02:03.360> tile

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
they would flip over this first tile

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.929 
they would flip over this first tile
you'll<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.700> goal<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you'll see that right now the goal is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
you'll see that right now the goal is
going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.140> either<00:02:07.350> any<00:02:07.799> area<00:02:08.550> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
going to be to make either any area of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
going to be to make either any area of
four<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.450> size<00:02:09.720> meaning<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.619> same<00:02:10.830> color

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
four in size meaning all the same color

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.140 
four in size meaning all the same color
for<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.520> size<00:02:11.730> something<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.110> three

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
for in size something like one two three

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
for in size something like one two three
for<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.600> see<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.990> for<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.320> size<00:02:16.560> here

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
for you can see this is for in size here

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.310 
for you can see this is for in size here
any<00:02:17.670> shape<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.630> size<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.110> no

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
any shape that is for in size but no

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.700 
any shape that is for in size but no
more<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.890> no<00:02:20.370> less<00:02:20.400> or<00:02:21.020> for<00:02:22.020> even<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.380> points

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
more and no less or for even more points

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.290 
more and no less or for even more points
if<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.890> make<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> square<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.240> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
if you can make a square that is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.450 
if you can make a square that is
obviously<00:02:24.960> for<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.380> size<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.100> will<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.340> worth

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
obviously for in size it will be worth

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.940 
obviously for in size it will be worth
two<00:02:26.640> points<00:02:26.880> now<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.720> point<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.170> you're

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
two points now from this point on you're

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
two points now from this point on you're
going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.400> ahead<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.910> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
going to go ahead and you're going to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.760 
going to go ahead and you're going to
start<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.510> everyone's<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.380> playing

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
start and everyone's going to be playing

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.440 
start and everyone's going to be playing
the<00:02:31.980> same<00:02:32.160> piece<00:02:32.460> each<00:02:32.730> turn<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.330> you're

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the same piece each turn what you're

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.400 
the same piece each turn what you're
going<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.630> do<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.900> you're<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.170> flip<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
going to do is you're going to flip the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.040 
going to do is you're going to flip the
top<00:02:34.620> tile<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.460> pile<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:36.020> little<00:02:37.020> things

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
top tile of this pile of little things

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.290 
top tile of this pile of little things
here<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.470> you'll<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> next<00:02:38.970> shape

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
here and you'll see what the next shape

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.670 
here and you'll see what the next shape
is<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.660> right<00:02:39.810> now<00:02:39.840> everybody<00:02:40.260> has<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.410> place

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
is so right now everybody has to place

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800 
is so right now everybody has to place
the<00:02:40.890> two<00:02:41.220> black<00:02:41.730> all<00:02:42.300> right<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.570> you're<00:02:42.720> going

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the two black all right so you're going

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the two black all right so you're going
to<00:02:42.900> grab<00:02:43.050> your<00:02:43.200> two<00:02:43.320> black<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.710> going

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
to grab your two black and you're going

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.110 
to grab your two black and you're going
to<00:02:43.890> figure<00:02:44.100> out<00:02:44.190> how<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> best<00:02:44.520> get<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:44.970> here

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
to figure out how to best get it in here

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520 
to figure out how to best get it in here
but<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.570> trick<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:46.050> once<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.350> place

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
but what the trick is is once you place

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.750 
but what the trick is is once you place
it<00:02:46.710> at<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.890> top<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> slide<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it at the top you have to slide it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.820 
it at the top you have to slide it
directly<00:02:47.850> down<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.080> i<00:02:49.140> replace<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.710> it

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
directly down so if i replace it here it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.740 
directly down so if i replace it here it
would<00:02:49.920> stop<00:02:50.160> right<00:02:50.490> there<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> mean<00:02:51.330> those<00:02:51.570> two

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
would stop right there I mean those two

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.880 
would stop right there I mean those two
pieces<00:02:51.900> underneath<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.770> be

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
pieces underneath are going to be

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.890 
pieces underneath are going to be
blocked<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> would<00:02:54.360> want<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.600> slide<00:02:54.750> this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
blocked so I would want to slide this

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.900 
blocked so I would want to slide this
down<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.550> not<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
down in a way that it's not going to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.250 
down in a way that it's not going to
block<00:02:57.090> things<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> creates<00:02:58.170> an

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
block things and so that it creates an

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.720 
block things and so that it creates an
area<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.740> can<00:02:58.890> make<00:02:59.040> into<00:02:59.220> something<00:02:59.550> for

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
area that I can make into something for

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.280 
area that I can make into something for
in<00:02:59.880> size<00:03:00.120> which<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.780> good<00:03:00.930> start<00:03:01.260> right

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
in size which is a good start right

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.290 
in size which is a good start right
there<00:03:01.490> once<00:03:02.490> everyone<00:03:02.730> has<00:03:02.910> done<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.150> you're

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
there once everyone has done this you're

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.970 
there once everyone has done this you're
going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> flip<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> next<00:03:03.870> tile<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.860> you'll

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
going to flip the next tile and you'll

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.440 
going to flip the next tile and you'll
see<00:03:05.100> what<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.520> we<00:03:05.670> have<00:03:05.820> two<00:03:06.030> purple

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
see what it is so we have two purple

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.060 
see what it is so we have two purple
well<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.320> really<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.590> any<00:03:07.800> purple

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
well I don't really have any purple

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.680 
well I don't really have any purple
right<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.490> maybe<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.760> take<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.300> purple

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
right now so maybe I take this to purple

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
right now so maybe I take this to purple
and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.990> slide<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.260> down<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:10.710> here<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.190> you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
and I slide it down over here and you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.090 
and I slide it down over here and you
grab<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.330> next<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:13.320> too<00:03:13.560> blue<00:03:13.830> well

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
grab the next one and it's too blue well

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.580 
grab the next one and it's too blue well
this<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> lot<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.210> two's<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.660> row<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.990> that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
this is a lot of two's in a row but that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.980 
this is a lot of two's in a row but that
works<00:03:16.770> out<00:03:16.980> maybe<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.670> send<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.270> one<00:03:18.510> right

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
works out maybe I send this one right

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.690 
works out maybe I send this one right
here<00:03:19.500> actually<00:03:20.460> it's<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.030> bad<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:23.490> you

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
here actually it's not so bad and you

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.010 
here actually it's not so bad and you
keep<00:03:23.850> doing<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.180> until<00:03:24.330> basically<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
keep doing this until basically the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.290 
keep doing this until basically the
whole<00:03:25.080> thing's<00:03:25.290> full<00:03:25.410> out<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.770> blue<00:03:26.010> again<00:03:26.300> and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
whole thing's full out to blue again and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.030 
whole thing's full out to blue again and
you<00:03:27.540> take<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.410> problem<00:03:28.680> so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you take this one this is a problem so

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.920 
you take this one this is a problem so
now<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.940> blue<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.210> going<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> difficult

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
now to blue is going to be a difficult

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.090 
now to blue is going to be a difficult
because<00:03:31.050> if<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.260> place<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.620> anywhere<00:03:31.740> around

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
because if I place it anywhere around

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.980 
because if I place it anywhere around
here<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.910> shape<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.150> going<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.510> larger

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
here this shape is going to be larger

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.680 
here this shape is going to be larger
than<00:03:34.170> four<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.850> place<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.180> down<00:03:36.270> here<00:03:36.510> it's

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
than four if I place it down here it's

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.570 
than four if I place it down here it's
still<00:03:36.960> larger<00:03:37.230> than<00:03:37.410> four<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:38.220> means<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
still larger than four which means that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.550 
still larger than four which means that
I<00:03:38.610> need<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.850> somehow<00:03:39.060> separate<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.380> order

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
I need to somehow separate it in order

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.810 
I need to somehow separate it in order
to<00:03:40.680> keep<00:03:40.770> it<00:03:40.890> from<00:03:41.010> being<00:03:41.160> larger<00:03:41.490> than<00:03:41.520> for

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
to keep it from being larger than for

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.340 
to keep it from being larger than for
later<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.480> maybe<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.720> put<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.020> over<00:03:43.110> there

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
later on so maybe I put it over there

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.140 
later on so maybe I put it over there
you<00:03:43.650> flip<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.950> next<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.310> however

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
you flip the next one however

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.970 
you flip the next one however
alternatively<00:03:46.140> if<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.320> didn't<00:03:46.650> want<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.860> do

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
alternatively if I didn't want to do

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190 
alternatively if I didn't want to do
this<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.760> one<00:03:48.030> gray<00:03:48.390> piece<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.930> i<00:03:49.020> can

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
this I have one gray piece that i can

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.710 
this I have one gray piece that i can
use<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.680> gray<00:03:50.340> piece<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.880> neutral<00:03:51.420> doesn't

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
use this gray piece is neutral doesn't

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
use this gray piece is neutral doesn't
count<00:03:51.840> against<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.470> at<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:53.580> just

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
count against you at all and just

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.340 
count against you at all and just
doesn't<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.330> any<00:03:54.510> colors<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.020> matches

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
doesn't have any colors that matches

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.290 
doesn't have any colors that matches
with<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.400> place<00:03:56.550> my<00:03:56.760> gray<00:03:57.000> piece

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
with it so that can place my gray piece

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.360 
with it so that can place my gray piece
out<00:03:57.590> somewhere<00:03:58.590> maybe<00:03:58.740> I<00:03:58.860> put<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.070> out<00:03:59.130> here

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
out somewhere maybe I put it out here

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.950 
out somewhere maybe I put it out here
I've<00:03:59.640> screwed<00:04:00.090> up<00:04:00.240> my<00:04:00.390> chances<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.780> getting

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
I've screwed up my chances of getting

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.410 
I've screwed up my chances of getting
black<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.130> can<00:04:02.310> still<00:04:02.610> get<00:04:02.790> my<00:04:02.940> blue<00:04:03.150> pretty

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
black but I can still get my blue pretty

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.700 
black but I can still get my blue pretty
easily<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> don't<00:04:04.110> have<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.380> place<00:04:04.560> this

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
easily and I don't have to place this

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.380 
easily and I don't have to place this
double<00:04:05.010> blue<00:04:05.130> piece<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.580> you'll<00:04:06.000> see<00:04:06.150> some<00:04:06.360> of

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
double blue piece and you'll see some of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.300 
double blue piece and you'll see some of
these<00:04:06.570> are<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.020> be<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.740> two<00:04:08.040> different

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
these are going to be the two different

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.010 
these are going to be the two different
color<00:04:08.520> pieces<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> red<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.810> blue

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
color pieces so we have a red and a blue

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.630 
color pieces so we have a red and a blue
which<00:04:10.290> would<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.560> good<00:04:10.710> for<00:04:10.920> my<00:04:11.010> blues<00:04:11.280> here

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
which would be good for my blues here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
which would be good for my blues here
because<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:11.970> put<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.270> out<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.680> now<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.710> have<00:04:13.890> a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
because I put it out and now I have a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.340 
because I put it out and now I have a
size<00:04:14.220> four<00:04:14.700> shape<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.210> blue<00:04:15.390> but<00:04:16.109> anyhow

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
size four shape of blue but anyhow

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.210 
size four shape of blue but anyhow
you're<00:04:16.440> going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> keep<00:04:16.739> doing<00:04:16.770> this<00:04:17.160> until

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
you're going to keep doing this until

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.979 
you're going to keep doing this until
every<00:04:17.670> player<00:04:17.880> has<00:04:17.910> filled<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:18.540> their<00:04:18.720> board

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
sites line I should say of red pieces is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.080 
sites line I should say of red pieces is
going<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.020> be<00:05:05.110> worth<00:05:05.290> two<00:05:05.740> points<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:06.730> these

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
going to be worth two points so these

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.230 
going to be worth two points so these
add<00:05:07.450> up<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:08.440> for<00:05:08.680> size<00:05:08.890> shapes<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.400> a3<00:05:10.090> size

red shape will be good you'll continue

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.140 
red shape will be good you'll continue
on<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.980> same<00:05:12.100> pattern<00:05:12.460> flipping<00:05:12.820> pieces

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
on the same pattern flipping pieces

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.550 
on the same pattern flipping pieces
these<00:05:13.270> will<00:05:13.360> be<00:05:13.450> shuffled<00:05:13.810> flipping<00:05:14.470> these

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
these will be shuffled flipping these

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.020 
these will be shuffled flipping these
from<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.860> top<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.100> placing<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.640> pieces<00:05:15.940> out

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
from the top and placing the pieces out

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.390

as they come after that you'll go on to

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.860 
as they come after that you'll go on to
the<00:05:18.520> third<00:05:18.700> round<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.300> third<00:05:19.480> round<00:05:19.660> is

the third round and the third round is

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.570 
the third round and the third round is
usually<00:05:20.260> something<00:05:20.500> negative<00:05:20.860> you'll<00:05:21.400> see

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
usually something negative you'll see

here any area in what of one in sizes

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.740 
here any area in what of one in sizes
worth<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.310> negative<00:05:24.790> point<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.270> not<00:05:25.420> only<00:05:25.450> do

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750

last<00:05:43.450> round<00:05:43.750> in<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.740> last<00:05:44.770> round<00:05:45.130> is<00:05:45.430> going<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
last round in the last round is going to

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.310 
last round in the last round is going to
be<00:05:46.120> something<00:05:46.270> even<00:05:46.600> harder<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.080> case

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
be something even harder in this case

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.909 
be something even harder in this case
it's<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.160> 5<00:05:48.520> size<00:05:48.940> shape<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.750> this<00:05:50.110> Z<00:05:50.380> size<00:05:50.620> so

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
it's a 5 size shape and this Z size so

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.530 
it's a 5 size shape and this Z size so
two<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.640> bottom<00:05:51.760> two<00:05:52.000> on<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.150> top<00:05:52.300> and

three from top to bottom vertically is

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.820 
three from top to bottom vertically is
going<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.690> be<00:05:55.780> worth<00:05:55.900> four<00:05:56.200> points<00:05:56.230> so<00:05:56.680> you're

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
going to be worth four points so you're

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.860 
going to be worth four points so you're
trying<00:05:57.100> not<00:05:57.160> only<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.730> get<00:05:58.030> for<00:05:58.270> size<00:05:58.510> shapes

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870

my<00:06:46.150> review<00:06:46.360> of<00:06:46.419> fits<00:06:46.810> you'll<00:06:47.050> probably<00:06:47.530> know

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
my review of fits you'll probably know

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.320 
my review of fits you'll probably know
that<00:06:47.949> I<00:06:48.039> like<00:06:48.250> fits<00:06:48.520> quite<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:48.789> bit<00:06:49.000> it's<00:06:49.150> very

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
that I like fits quite a bit it's very

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.839 
that I like fits quite a bit it's very
simple<00:06:49.720> it's<00:06:50.680> very<00:06:50.830> tetra<00:06:51.340> see<00:06:51.490> and<00:06:51.639> I<00:06:51.669> think

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
simple it's very tetra see and I think

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.999 
simple it's very tetra see and I think
it's<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.659> simplicity<00:06:52.900> of<00:06:53.289> it<00:06:53.440> combined<00:06:53.830> with

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
it's the simplicity of it combined with

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.770 
it's the simplicity of it combined with
the<00:06:54.159> frustration<00:06:54.909> that<00:06:54.940> comes<00:06:55.330> with<00:06:55.599> not

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
the frustration that comes with not

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.629 
the frustration that comes with not
getting<00:06:56.020> the<00:06:56.229> pieces<00:06:56.530> you<00:06:56.620> want<00:06:56.800> and<00:06:57.039> trying

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
getting the pieces you want and trying

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.670 
getting the pieces you want and trying
to<00:06:57.849> deal<00:06:58.150> with<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.449> pieces<00:06:58.720> that<00:06:58.900> you<00:06:59.050> have<00:06:59.409> to

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
to deal with the pieces that you have to

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.100 
to deal with the pieces that you have to
is<00:06:59.860> what<00:07:00.370> makes<00:07:00.550> the<00:07:00.789> game<00:07:00.940> really<00:07:01.180> good<00:07:01.539> now

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
is what makes the game really good now

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.189 
is what makes the game really good now
Fitz<00:07:02.409> has<00:07:02.650> a<00:07:02.680> lot<00:07:03.009> of<00:07:03.569> homemade<00:07:04.569> expansions

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
Fitz has a lot of homemade expansions

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.330 
Fitz has a lot of homemade expansions
that<00:07:05.259> people<00:07:05.500> have<00:07:05.590> done<00:07:05.740> and<00:07:05.860> I'm<00:07:05.919> sure<00:07:06.099> bits

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
that people have done and I'm sure bits

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.950 
that people have done and I'm sure bits
has<00:07:06.520> those<00:07:06.699> as<00:07:06.819> well<00:07:06.940> I<00:07:07.000> haven't<00:07:07.240> had<00:07:07.449> time<00:07:07.930> to

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
has those as well I haven't had time to

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.110 
has those as well I haven't had time to
check<00:07:08.110> it<00:07:08.379> out<00:07:08.500> but<00:07:08.979> I<00:07:09.009> think<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.550> variation

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
check it out but I think the variation

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.640 
check it out but I think the variation
that<00:07:10.210> you<00:07:10.360> get<00:07:10.509> by<00:07:10.629> the<00:07:10.690> combination<00:07:11.349> of<00:07:11.409> four

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
that you get by the combination of four

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.930 
that you get by the combination of four
different<00:07:11.800> cards<00:07:12.280> for<00:07:12.460> each<00:07:12.490> of<00:07:12.699> the<00:07:12.789> four

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
different cards for each of the four

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.730 
different cards for each of the four
different<00:07:13.210> rounds<00:07:13.569> I<00:07:13.690> will<00:07:14.199> keep<00:07:14.349> the<00:07:14.560> game

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
different rounds I will keep the game

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.980 
different rounds I will keep the game
pretty<00:07:14.949> fresh<00:07:15.430> as<00:07:15.639> time<00:07:15.849> goes<00:07:16.060> on<00:07:16.210> plus<00:07:16.810> the

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
pretty fresh as time goes on plus the

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.570 
pretty fresh as time goes on plus the
order<00:07:17.319> that<00:07:17.469> the<00:07:17.560> pieces<00:07:17.860> come<00:07:18.009> out<00:07:18.159> and<00:07:18.370> makes

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
order that the pieces come out and makes

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.580 
order that the pieces come out and makes
it<00:07:18.729> more<00:07:18.849> difficult<00:07:19.030> to<00:07:19.330> plan<00:07:19.569> ahead<00:07:19.750> so<00:07:20.110> I

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
it more difficult to plan ahead so I

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.129 
it more difficult to plan ahead so I
think<00:07:20.740> the<00:07:21.729> frustration<00:07:22.330> that<00:07:22.479> arises<00:07:22.990> from

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
think the frustration that arises from

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.689 
think the frustration that arises from
that<00:07:23.349> like<00:07:23.620> I<00:07:23.710> said<00:07:23.889> earlier<00:07:23.919> is<00:07:24.340> really

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
that like I said earlier is really

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.969 
that like I said earlier is really
interesting<00:07:25.330> and<00:07:25.389> keeps<00:07:25.599> the<00:07:25.690> game<00:07:25.840> fun<00:07:26.199> and

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:26.979 
interesting and keeps the game fun and

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.159 
interesting and keeps the game fun and
fresh<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.310> light<00:07:27.669> and<00:07:28.479> all<00:07:28.810> together<00:07:28.960> I<00:07:29.110> think

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
fresh and light and all together I think

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:30.809 
fresh and light and all together I think
it's<00:07:29.379> a<00:07:29.440> very<00:07:29.560> well-designed<00:07:30.370> game

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:30.819 
it's a very well-designed game

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:33.209 
it's a very well-designed game
especially<00:07:31.210> for<00:07:31.750> a<00:07:31.780> lighter<00:07:32.110> game<00:07:32.469> to<00:07:33.039> get<00:07:33.190> a

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:33.219 
especially for a lighter game to get a

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:37.129 
especially for a lighter game to get a
good<00:07:33.580> quick<00:07:33.909> gaming<00:07:34.419> experience<00:07:34.840> in<00:07:35.050> with<00:07:35.620> a

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 
good quick gaming experience in with a

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.330 
good quick gaming experience in with a
challenging<00:07:38.139> feel<00:07:38.409> and<00:07:38.710> yet<00:07:38.919> not<00:07:39.099> have<00:07:39.310> a

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.340 
challenging feel and yet not have a

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.159 
challenging feel and yet not have a
whole<00:07:39.520> lot<00:07:39.669> of<00:07:39.699> rules<00:07:39.969> involved<00:07:40.569> so<00:07:41.050> if<00:07:41.110> that

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
whole lot of rules involved so if that

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.020 
whole lot of rules involved so if that
