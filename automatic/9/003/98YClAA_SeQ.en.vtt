00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello everyone with you the background of the planets and here 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 finally decided to make a video lesson on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.639
 launch various cool games on android 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.720
 through a special emulator which 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.060
 called ppsspp is a psp emulator 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.119
 in general, and you can play psp games 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.770
 right on your android smartphone in general 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 the emulator is generally very good to me 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.480
 liked this animation is still cool 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.579
 here are the triangles squares there any 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 the animation is comfortable scrolling through this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.950
 also comfortable and everything is so beautiful 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 done right in general and you mean 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 Several games have already thrown off and that is the day 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.969
 nothing needs to be set up just 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 Throw in the root of the memory card you can not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.000
 root of the memory card to any place and knowing 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 vsky him just the root of the memory card 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.289
 several games 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.109
 There are games that weigh 100 megabytes 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.769
 group action fool month and a half or 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.769
 even two kinds 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 dohrena games of various general will now 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.759
 test your who is interested yes and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.610
 In general, as if now on android 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.210
 so many all sorts of great games have become 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 release what i'm gonna do so 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.789
 A review, that is , on the psp of the contact game 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.259
 android also go fine on android 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.319
 There are several games without a difference 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.080
 so let's talk like that all in 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.000
 generally installed just means like 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.240
 I speak already throw off in a card root 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 memory game and just run that is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.630
 do nothing 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 install click and run 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.980
 mainly tested ten games 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.370
 more of them flew less of them 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.710
 braked that is, as if 50 to 50 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.310
 about there are games that generally lag 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.840
 There are games that fly 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.750
 like this for example in NSF 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.270
 bridge vanted flies that is everything is fine 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.260
 Comes as if what I tested 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.700
 total 2 meaning it is 15-20 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.920
 something like this can be seen by 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 link like doubled and play 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.640
 principle can be but anyway and gives 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.140
 this result that I would like a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.140
 create try race on the spot 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.080
 can also look now either 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.340
 just link to the video too 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.540
 tested and his most wanted how goes 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.810
 means and also tested 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.910
 star wars battlefront 2 which can 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:58.210
 see here means how we go all 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.060
 flies excellent and some problems 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.460
 unnoticed at all in the problem emulator 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.250
 undetected and sideways bugs there departures 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.230
 I began digging there is no everything is fine as it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.300
 idiot even on those games that ask 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.880
 It means hell and not the only garbage 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.890
 which did not like I do not know what 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.760
 this is due to the performance then 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.590
 there is if the game lags starts along with 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.220
 I lag and the sound is such a garbage but I 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.250
 I think this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.280
 affairs in all emulators i.e. game 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.360
 will lag on any emulator this is a broom 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.500
 gatisse seems to me so because the game 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.500
 runs through the emulator 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.459
 we see how everything flies when in this 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:52.530
 the game seems to be no brakes with sound 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.300
 the sound is noticed too so that you can safely 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.310
 install info is most wanted 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.890
 Kamyshin phone and tablet 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.640
 fce most wanted 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.060
 and emulator play normal with most 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.000
 wanted 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.410
 that is, it is much better than 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.730
 original which is more original 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.010
 who came out on android 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.730
 everything is so much interesting here 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:20.350
 cool cards are very similar to the pc version 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.590
 but in general, here is such a wonderful 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.570
 emulator that is low any difficulties 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.190
 In the installation, everything in general is fine 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.200
 Now I will test a lot 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.330
 different games through this emulator so 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.220
 how can you run such games and games 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.969
 on android that is adding such 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.909

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:52.790

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.650
 playstation probably still playstation 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.010
 and I don't know it makes no sense then all the same on 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.010
 searches seem to me or better here 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.410
 In general, I will now test dohrena 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.490
