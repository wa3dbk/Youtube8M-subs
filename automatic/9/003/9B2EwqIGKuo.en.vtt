00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.669 
solutions
I<00:00:42.489> think<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.179> integration<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.870> architecture

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
I think the integration of architecture

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.029 
I think the integration of architecture
and<00:00:44.890> design<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.460> up<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:45.910> our<00:00:46.030> company

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and design and up in our company

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.229 
and design and up in our company
interfacing<00:00:48.039> into<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.429> architectural<00:00:49.030> world

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
interfacing into the architectural world

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.389 
interfacing into the architectural world
is<00:00:49.390> incredibly<00:00:49.750> important<00:00:50.469> for<00:00:50.649> architects

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
is incredibly important for architects

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.119 
is incredibly important for architects
in<00:00:51.550> particular<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.629> can<00:00:52.809> provide<00:00:53.199> all<00:00:53.829> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
in particular we can provide all the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.829 
in particular we can provide all the
draw<00:00:54.339> points<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.000> you<00:00:55.030> have<00:00:55.359> this<00:00:55.480> kind<00:00:55.690> of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
draw points so you have this kind of

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.959 
draw points so you have this kind of
consistency<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.070> aesthetic<00:00:57.489> of<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.760> room

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
consistency in the aesthetic of the room

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.880 
consistency in the aesthetic of the room
and<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.449> kind<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.719> harmony<00:00:59.109> but<00:00:59.769> we're

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
and this kind of harmony but we're

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.680 
and this kind of harmony but we're
actually<00:01:00.039> looking<00:01:00.399> at<00:01:00.519> this<00:01:00.730> concept<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.329> eco

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
actually looking at this concept of eco

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.350 
actually looking at this concept of eco
enjoyment<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.620> mean<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.760> that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
enjoyment I mean and and that's

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.510 
enjoyment I mean and and that's
difficult<00:01:04.600> as<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> concept<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:06.010> communicate

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
difficult as a concept to communicate

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.040 
difficult as a concept to communicate
but<00:01:06.670> basically<00:01:07.000> we're<00:01:07.540> trying<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.840> look<00:01:07.960> at

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
but basically we're trying to look at

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.440 
but basically we're trying to look at
reducing<00:01:08.140> consumption<00:01:08.860> actually<00:01:09.460> enhancing

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
reducing consumption actually enhancing

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.840 
reducing consumption actually enhancing
the<00:01:10.630> experience<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.040> our<00:01:12.220> new<00:01:12.550> products

is a series of three towers either on
eco<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.110> solo<00:01:17.470> but<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.130> brought<00:01:18.280> along

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

it's a flattish shower we've ever made

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.030 
it's a flattish shower we've ever made
so<00:01:34.570> from<00:01:34.780> an<00:01:34.870> engineering<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.650> engineering

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
so from an engineering and engineering

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.800 
so from an engineering and engineering
point<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.520> view<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.940> that's<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.510> bit<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.750> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
point of view is that's it's a bit of a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.420 
point of view is that's it's a bit of a
breakthrough<00:01:38.050> actually<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:38.800> then<00:01:39.250> we've

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
breakthrough actually and then we've

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.030 
breakthrough actually and then we've
added<00:01:39.730> on<00:01:40.060> top<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.600> this<00:01:41.140> dimmer<00:01:41.680> switch

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
added on top of that this dimmer switch

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.400 
added on top of that this dimmer switch
this<00:01:42.340> dimmer<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.270> allow<00:01:43.600> consumers<00:01:43.900> as<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.200> said

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
this dimmer to allow consumers as I said

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.950 
this dimmer to allow consumers as I said
before<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:45.280> reduce<00:01:45.700> consumption<00:01:46.330> what<00:01:46.810> when

on top of that thing of course then

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.360 
on top of that thing of course then
we've<00:01:52.480> taken<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.870> center<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.890> incredibly

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
we've taken the center out so incredibly

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.520 
we've taken the center out so incredibly
difficult<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.480> actually<00:01:55.750> produce<00:01:55.870> but<00:01:56.320> a

not<00:02:31.420> saying<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:33.069> have

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
not saying you have to you know have

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.740 
not saying you have to you know have
your<00:02:33.370> flow<00:02:33.610> cut<00:02:33.880> off<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.420> negative

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
your flow cut off it's a negative

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.570 
your flow cut off it's a negative
experience<00:02:34.989> actually<00:02:35.530> telling<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.220> consumer

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
experience actually telling the consumer

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.949 
experience actually telling the consumer
and<00:02:36.700> having<00:02:36.940> something<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.569> hands

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
and having something in your hands

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.930 
and having something in your hands
always<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.950> reminds<00:02:39.400> me<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.670> know<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.850> can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
always that reminds me you know you can

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.090 
always that reminds me you know you can
reduce<00:02:40.300> consumption<00:02:40.750> when<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.170> want<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.590> and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
reduce consumption when you want to and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.410 
reduce consumption when you want to and
I<00:02:42.190> think<00:02:42.400> that's<00:02:42.580> that's<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.970> more<00:02:43.180> positive

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
I think that's that's a more positive

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020 
I think that's that's a more positive
experience<00:02:44.110> when<00:02:44.800> consumers<00:02:45.310> actually<00:02:45.640> are

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
experience when consumers actually are

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.690 
experience when consumers actually are
they<00:02:46.420> take<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.220> responsibility<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.400> they

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
they take the responsibility and they

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.580 
they take the responsibility and they
have<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.269> option<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.870> opportunity<00:02:50.470> to

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
have the the option the opportunity to

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.840 
have the the option the opportunity to
do<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.830> when<00:02:51.010> they<00:02:51.160> would<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.580> do<00:02:51.730> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
do it when they would like to do it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.210 
do it when they would like to do it
we've<00:02:52.630> actually<00:02:52.780> started<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.500> produce<00:02:53.950> the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
we've actually started to produce the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.009 
we've actually started to produce the
thing<00:02:54.370> called<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.640> water<00:02:54.850> calculator<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.780> you

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
thing called a water calculator so you

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.289 
thing called a water calculator so you
can<00:02:56.530> now<00:02:56.680> start<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.100> calculate<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:58.030> know<00:02:58.120> with

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
can now start to calculate you know with

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.059 
can now start to calculate you know with
a<00:02:58.330> certain<00:02:58.780> amount<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.110> bedrooms<00:02:59.319> for<00:02:59.739> example

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
a certain amount of bedrooms for example

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.220 
a certain amount of bedrooms for example
in<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.250> hotel<00:03:00.640> if<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.360> use<00:03:01.569> our<00:03:01.900> products

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
in the hotel if you use our products

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.530 
in the hotel if you use our products
with<00:03:02.350> eco<00:03:02.620> joy<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:03.400> would<00:03:03.549> be<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> saving<00:03:04.330> in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
with eco joy what would be the saving in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.960 
with eco joy what would be the saving in
terms<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.799> water<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.489> course<00:03:06.519> how<00:03:06.819> many

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
terms of the water of course how many

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.550 
terms of the water of course how many
litres<00:03:07.330> or<00:03:07.510> gallons<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.290> planning<00:03:08.530> that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
litres or gallons so the planning that

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.050 
litres or gallons so the planning that
come<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:09.940> also

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
come to you in and that can also

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210 
come to you in and that can also
translate<00:03:10.600> through<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> cost<00:03:11.350> saving<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.100> we

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
translate through to a cost saving so we

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.610 
translate through to a cost saving so we
using<00:03:12.940> digital<00:03:13.390> technologies<00:03:14.230> if<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.470> like

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
using digital technologies if you like

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.229 
using digital technologies if you like
it<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.100> many<00:03:15.160> different<00:03:15.370> ways<00:03:15.700> now<00:03:16.000> not

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
it in so many different ways now not

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.539 
it in so many different ways now not
technology<00:03:16.569> allows<00:03:17.440> us<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.799> be<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.100> would<00:03:18.519> say

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
technology allows us to be I would say

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.680 
technology allows us to be I would say
more<00:03:18.910> accurate<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.019> also<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:21.220> think<00:03:21.730> we<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:22.120> we

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
more accurate but also I think we can we

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 
more accurate but also I think we can we
can<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.109> more<00:03:23.260> tailored<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.829> more<00:03:24.250> specific

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
can be more tailored and more specific

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.910 
can be more tailored and more specific
to<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> consumers<00:03:25.570> needs<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.320> transition<00:03:26.799> our

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
to the consumers needs we transition our

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.220 
to the consumers needs we transition our
brand<00:03:27.190> from<00:03:27.489> from<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.090> more<00:03:28.239> rational<00:03:28.480> brand<00:03:29.019> so

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
brand from from a more rational brand so

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.140 
brand from from a more rational brand so
I<00:03:29.260> say<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.799> know<00:03:29.829> water<00:03:30.160> technology<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.940> us<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
I say you know water technology of us a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.930 
I say you know water technology of us a
technology<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.400> earn<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> more<00:03:33.760> emotional

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
technology to earn a more emotional

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.599 
technology to earn a more emotional
ground<00:03:34.450> which<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.630> enjoy<00:03:35.079> water<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.739> when<00:03:36.340> one

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
ground which is enjoy water and when one

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.039 
ground which is enjoy water and when one
thing<00:03:36.790> some<00:03:37.000> enjoyment<00:03:37.359> of<00:03:37.570> water

thing some enjoyment of water

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.080 
thing some enjoyment of water
I<00:03:38.079> think<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.829> optimum<00:03:39.400> way<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.579> enjoy<00:03:39.850> water

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
I think the optimum way to enjoy water

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.849 
I think the optimum way to enjoy water
is<00:03:40.209> actually<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.540> consume<00:03:40.900> water<00:03:41.140> we're<00:03:41.739> going

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859

you could say a well being century but

you could say a well being century but
absolutely<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:39.129> really<00:04:39.429> is<00:04:39.519> a<00:04:39.549> sanctuary<00:04:39.909> it's

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:40.269 
absolutely it really is a sanctuary it's

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.429 
absolutely it really is a sanctuary it's
the<00:04:40.449> last<00:04:40.629> place<00:04:40.809> that<00:04:41.019> you<00:04:41.110> can<00:04:41.259> lock

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
yourself in and really take some time

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.419 
yourself in and really take some time
out<00:04:43.749> from<00:04:44.019> from<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.379> busy<00:04:44.739> you<00:04:44.919> know<00:04:45.009> hectic

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:45.429 
out from from the busy you know hectic

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.699 
out from from the busy you know hectic
schedule<00:04:45.879> in<00:04:45.999> the<00:04:46.089> world<00:04:46.299> and<00:04:46.689> actually<00:04:47.289> have

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:47.709 
schedule in the world and actually have

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.529 
schedule in the world and actually have
some<00:04:47.949> personal<00:04:48.489> time<00:04:48.759> some<00:04:49.029> personal<00:04:49.449> space

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
some personal time some personal space

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.529 
some personal time some personal space
so<00:04:50.319> we<00:04:50.439> actually<00:04:50.619> we<00:04:51.009> approach<00:04:51.699> this<00:04:51.879> as<00:04:52.509> a

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
so we actually we approach this as a

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.779 
so we actually we approach this as a
concept<00:04:52.959> of<00:04:53.199> it's<00:04:53.439> the<00:04:53.559> last<00:04:53.799> personal

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
concept of it's the last personal

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.429 
concept of it's the last personal
century<00:04:55.299> and<00:04:55.599> I<00:04:55.689> think<00:04:55.899> that's<00:04:56.049> how<00:04:56.139> we<00:04:56.169> should

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
century and I think that's how we should

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.559 
century and I think that's how we should
approach<00:04:56.529> in<00:04:56.829> the<00:04:56.919> future<00:04:57.249> with<00:04:57.849> products<00:04:58.419> but

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
approach in the future with products but

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.600 
approach in the future with products but
with<00:04:58.689> the<00:04:58.809> space<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.439> the<00:04:59.559> materials<00:05:00.129> it

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
with the space with the materials it

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.850 
with the space with the materials it
should<00:05:00.819> be<00:05:00.939> far<00:05:01.209> more<00:05:01.239> sensual<00:05:01.899> I'd<00:05:02.259> like<00:05:02.709> to
