00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
bit of it out and if there's any excess
you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.780> wipe<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.080> off<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.380> hand<00:01:37.650> first

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you can just wipe it off your hand first

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940 
you can just wipe it off your hand first
so<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> start<00:01:39.420> lining<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:39.990> eye<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.650> don't

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so when I start lining my eye I don't

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.320 
so when I start lining my eye I don't
start<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> inner<00:01:41.580> corner<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
start from the inner corner or the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.480 
start from the inner corner or the
outside<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.080> start<00:01:43.409> lining<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> middle

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
outside I start lining from the middle

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
outside I start lining from the middle
right<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.750> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> pull<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.680> eye

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
right here and I kind of pull on my eye

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:58.140 
right here and I kind of pull on my eye
bit<00:01:48.439> just<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.650> make<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.860> smooth

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.270 

so<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:58.960> see<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.290> kind<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.710> like<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.920> thin

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
so you can see it's kind of like a thin

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.180 
so you can see it's kind of like a thin
line<00:02:00.580> right<00:02:00.610> here<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.540> then<00:02:02.410> I'll<00:02:02.740> keep<00:02:02.950> going

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
line right here and then I'll keep going

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.130 
line right here and then I'll keep going
but<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.550> can<00:02:03.820> see<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.420> already<00:02:04.810> done<00:02:04.960> I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
but you can see this is already done I

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:30.460 
but you can see this is already done I
don't<00:02:05.200> bring<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.680> eyeliner<00:02:06.040> all<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.400> way<00:02:06.520> in

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.440 

and<00:02:31.070> now<00:02:31.220> it's<00:02:31.370> kind<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.580> disconnected<00:02:32.240> at<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
and now it's kind of disconnected at the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.440 
and now it's kind of disconnected at the
corner<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.380> do<00:02:33.740> is<00:02:34.330> from<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
corner so what I like to do is from the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.390 
corner so what I like to do is from the
inside<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.960> line<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.160> kind<00:02:37.340> of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
inside of the line here I just kind of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.760 
inside of the line here I just kind of
draw<00:02:37.640> out<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:39.020> whatever<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.410> missing

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
draw out and then whatever is missing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:53.280 
draw out and then whatever is missing
here<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.250> fill<00:02:40.700> in

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.320 

and<00:02:53.409> then<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.159> it<00:02:54.250> looks<00:02:54.430> kind<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.730> messy<00:02:54.790> I'd

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
and then if it looks kind of messy I'd

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.690 
and then if it looks kind of messy I'd
go<00:02:55.450> back<00:02:55.599> in<00:02:55.780> with<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.930> q-tip<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:57.400> makeup

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
go back in with a q-tip and a makeup

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.630 
go back in with a q-tip and a makeup
remover<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.360> then<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.569> fix<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> with<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
remover and then I fix it so with the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.429 
remover and then I fix it so with the
makeup<00:03:00.970> remover<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.750> get<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.019> line<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
makeup remover just to get the line to

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.770 
makeup remover just to get the line to
be<00:03:02.560> really<00:03:02.860> clean<00:03:03.209> with<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.360> end<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.689> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
be really clean with the end of the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
be really clean with the end of the
q-tip<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.439> just<00:03:05.709> kind<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.950> draw<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.549> like<00:03:06.730> this

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.530 

until<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:13.120> get<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.720> be<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:15.150> shape<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.209> I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
until I get it to be the shape that I

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:26.320 
until I get it to be the shape that I
want

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.910 

and<00:03:27.330> then<00:03:27.600> if<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.870> want<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.320> be<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> little

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and then if you want it to be a little

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280 
and then if you want it to be a little
more<00:03:29.420> defined<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.630> end<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.960> took<00:03:31.110> too

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
more defined on the end if you took too

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.120 
more defined on the end if you took too
much<00:03:31.410> off<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:33.090> can<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.300> kind<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.130> keep

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
much off you can just kind of keep

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.040 
much off you can just kind of keep
looking<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.790> matching<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.450> make<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> even

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050
