00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.110
 Please reply 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.320
 As the hand tangled in the line touches 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.350
 Run a dream and reach out 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.140
 Unexpectedly 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.840
 Be familiar with the dazzling scenery 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 Good morning in exchange 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.300
 I changed everything and lost something 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.800
 I still thought so 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.550
 Only one power was left 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.230
 A flood of light 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.130
 I can not tell you 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.820
 I have too many and what should I say 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.260
 When did it change? 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.580
 The distant sky felt so shallow 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.660
 Can you hear me 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.840
 I'm running now To grasp the wind 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.950
 Create a bouncy sound 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.690
 Wave of vibration 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.290
 The form of love dances 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.890
 Even the time you inflated 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
 The letter which pushed in too 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.990
 Let me wrap everything and good night 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.040
 Looking back, it broke into pieces 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.550
 I still thought so 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.150
 Only one light was illuminated 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.950
 Collect the light 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.220
 I looked up and was young It was weak 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:52.830
 That promise still gave up 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.340
 Please reply 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.500
 As the hand tangled in the line touches 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.550
 Run a dream and reach out 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.370
 Unexpectedly 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.980
 Be familiar with the dazzling scenery 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.820
 I can't forget the bunch of little miracle 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.900
 And still say one more thing ... 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 Na ... 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.230
 If you wake up 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.050
 It looks like a hole is open 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.220
 Even the phrase that was included 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.160
 I can not tell you 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.770
 I have too many and what should I say 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.280
 When did it change? 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.600
 The distant sky felt so shallow 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.240
 So with this hand 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.830
 With a determination I hope you will arrive 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.010
 Someday hopeless 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.690
 Blurred regret 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.420
 Throw it into the sun 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.010
 Gently tell you 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.080
 Terminal and terminal connect 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 Important files 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.980
 Gradually fill out 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.530
 Hugged like broken 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.100
 Can you hear me 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.320
 I'm running now To grasp the wind 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.390
 Create a bouncy sound 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.120
 Wave of vibration 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.870
 The form of love dances 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.620
 The front is distorted. 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.690
 Then let's go with a smile 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.270
 I decided straight 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:08.650
 Lara Rahara Thank you for tomorrow
