video we're talking about the experience
m4<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.400> mean<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> experience<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:15.150> three<00:00:15.389> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
m4 so I mean the experience at three is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.090 
m4 so I mean the experience at three is
not<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:16.109> even<00:00:16.289> been<00:00:16.560> released<00:00:16.710> yet<00:00:16.949> but

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
not actually even been released yet but

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.890 
not actually even been released yet but
it's<00:00:17.670> actually<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.240> around<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> corner

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
it's actually just around the corner

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
it's actually just around the corner
September<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> third<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.010> think<00:00:20.070> when

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
September the third is I think when

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
September the third is I think when
they're<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> announce<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:22.080> be

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
they're going to announce it and to be

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109 
they're going to announce it and to be
honest<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.800> turning<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
honest it's turning out to be a bit of a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.450 
honest it's turning out to be a bit of a
letdown<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:25.109> basically<00:00:25.500> using<00:00:25.800> exactly<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
letdown it's basically using exactly the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
letdown it's basically using exactly the
same<00:00:26.670> body<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:28.019> much<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.380> same

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
same body with pretty much the same

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
same body with pretty much the same
components<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> honestly<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.840> very

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
components and honestly it's just a very

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.970 
components and honestly it's just a very
bog-standard

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
bog-standard

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
bog-standard
fern<00:00:32.340> refresh<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> new

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
fern refresh and it's not really a new

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
fern refresh and it's not really a new
model<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.230> itself<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.520> honest<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
model in itself and to be honest this is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
model in itself and to be honest this is
what<00:00:36.120> we've<00:00:36.270> been<00:00:36.360> seeing<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> last<00:00:36.960> two

use the same body again again and just

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660

slightly obey the components it gets old

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.760 
slightly obey the components it gets old
fuss<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.330> that's<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:07.380> seeing<00:01:07.590> with

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
fuss and that's what we're seeing with

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
fuss and that's what we're seeing with
the<00:01:07.799> experience<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.460> three<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the experience at three so I think the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
the experience at three so I think the
experience<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.130> Sony<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> take<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
experience that for Sony has to take a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
experience that for Sony has to take a
totally<00:01:12.510> new<00:01:12.659> direction<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
totally new direction if they want to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.380 
totally new direction if they want to
remain<00:01:13.890> competitive<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> actually

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
remain competitive so if you actually

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
remain competitive so if you actually
look<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.750> LG's<00:01:16.140> phones<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.920> example

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
look at LG's phones you know for example

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740 
look at LG's phones you know for example
their<00:01:17.369> progression<00:01:17.700> between<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.240> LG<00:01:18.420> G

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
their progression between the LG G

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
their progression between the LG G
Optimus<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> lg<00:01:19.710> g2<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> LG<00:01:20.790> g3<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Optimus the lg g2 and the LG g3 the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
Optimus the lg g2 and the LG g3 the
differences<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> absolutely<00:01:23.130> massive

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
differences are just absolutely massive

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
differences are just absolutely massive
and<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.720> they've<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.080> totally<00:01:25.439> new

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and you know they've they're totally new

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
and you know they've they're totally new
phones<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> each<00:01:26.369> phone<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> significantly

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
phones and each phone is significantly

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
phones and each phone is significantly
better<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> last<00:01:28.229> was<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> Sony

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
better than the last was with the Sony

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
better than the last was with the Sony
phones<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.840> literally<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.259> no<00:01:31.409> reason

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
phones you would literally see no reason

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
phones you would literally see no reason
to<00:01:31.799> upgrade<00:01:32.009> okay<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:32.939> number<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to upgrade okay so number one is a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.719 
to upgrade okay so number one is a
larger<00:01:33.960> display<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.950> we've<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.280> seen<00:01:35.579> with

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
larger display so we've all seen with

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
larger display so we've all seen with
the<00:01:35.820> LG<00:01:36.060> g3<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.960> larger<00:01:37.470> display<00:01:37.799> can

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the LG g3 that a larger display can

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
the LG g3 that a larger display can
actually<00:01:38.430> work<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> mainstream<00:01:39.299> phone<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually work on a mainstream phone and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
actually work on a mainstream phone and
the<00:01:40.530> LG<00:01:40.740> g3<00:01:40.890> sales<00:01:41.369> figures<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the LG g3 sales figures are just a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
the LG g3 sales figures are just a
testament<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.140> sold<00:01:43.530> amazingly

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

well<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.439> Sony

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
well you know so I think if from Sony

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
well you know so I think if from Sony
bump<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> screen<00:01:47.640> size<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> maybe<00:01:48.240> five

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bump the screen size up to maybe five

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.969 
bump the screen size up to maybe five
point<00:01:48.810> four<00:01:49.020> five<00:01:49.290> point<00:01:49.560> five<00:01:49.710> something

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
point four five point five something

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
point four five point five something
like<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:50.970> like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
like that you know like you're not like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
like that you know like you're not like

than<00:02:17.810> certain<00:02:18.110> people<00:02:18.620> will<00:02:18.710> be<00:02:18.830> willing<00:02:19.160> to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
than certain people will be willing to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.860 
than certain people will be willing to
actually<00:02:19.400> pay<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.570> they're<00:02:20.810> getting

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
actually pay for that if they're getting

actually pay for that if they're getting
the<00:02:21.050> most<00:02:21.200> powerful<00:02:21.650> chip<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.040> market<00:02:22.490> now

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the most powerful chip on the market now

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.760 
the most powerful chip on the market now
the<00:02:23.090> reason<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.390> say<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.570> is<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.260> thing<00:02:24.590> is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
the reason I say this is this thing is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.800 
the reason I say this is this thing is
an<00:02:24.890> absolute<00:02:25.010> monster<00:02:25.700> known<00:02:26.570> only<00:02:26.660> as<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
an absolute monster known only as the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.930 
an absolute monster known only as the
energy<00:02:27.230> efficiency<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.800> literally<00:02:28.370> two<00:02:28.610> times

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
energy efficiency of literally two times

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
energy efficiency of literally two times
from<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.240> last<00:02:29.390> generation<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> actual

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
from the last generation but the actual

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.070 
from the last generation but the actual
performance<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.520> literally<00:02:31.940> mind-blowing<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
performance is literally mind-blowing so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.960 
performance is literally mind-blowing so
this<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.350> an<00:02:33.470> optical<00:02:33.830> processor<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:34.850> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
this is an optical processor and as you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.900 
this is an optical processor and as you
know<00:02:35.120> even<00:02:35.570> Snapdragon<00:02:36.080> 800<00:02:36.620> 801<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.340> 85

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
know even Snapdragon 800 801 and 85

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.640 
know even Snapdragon 800 801 and 85
they're<00:02:38.450> all<00:02:38.600> portable<00:02:38.930> processors<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
they're all portable processors and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
they're all portable processors and
you've<00:02:39.800> seen<00:02:40.010> how<00:02:40.160> well<00:02:40.340> they<00:02:40.550> perform<00:02:40.940> so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
you've seen how well they perform so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.210 
you've seen how well they perform so
imagine<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> next-gen<00:02:42.290> architecture<00:02:42.890> with<00:02:43.100> an

octa-core processor from the same

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.050 
octa-core processor from the same
company<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:45.890> pretty<00:02:46.160> mind-blowing<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.880> top

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
company it's pretty mind-blowing on top

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.250 
company it's pretty mind-blowing on top
of<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.390> whole<00:02:47.540> graphics<00:02:47.930> core<00:02:48.170> has

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
of that the whole graphics core has

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.630 
of that the whole graphics core has
actually<00:02:48.530> been<00:02:48.650> revamped<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.460> built

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
actually been revamped and it's built

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.910 
actually been revamped and it's built
from<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> ground<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.540> support<00:02:50.810> 3d<00:02:51.560> gaming

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
from the ground up to support 3d gaming

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.200 
from the ground up to support 3d gaming
out<00:02:52.280> 4k<00:02:52.880> resolutions<00:02:54.310> okay<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.490> one<00:02:55.670> thing<00:02:55.910> I

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
out 4k resolutions okay and one thing I

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.550 
out 4k resolutions okay and one thing I
think<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.540> certainly<00:02:56.870> should<00:02:57.050> actually<00:02:57.170> stay

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
think it certainly should actually stay

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.100 
think it certainly should actually stay
away<00:02:57.770> from<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:58.340> chips<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.150> Metallica<00:02:59.810> one

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
away from is chips like Metallica one

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.500 
away from is chips like Metallica one
where<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.040> CPU<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.640> sort<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.240> middle

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
where the CPU is sort of in the middle

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.780 
where the CPU is sort of in the middle
of<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.690> line<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.590> GPU<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.250> just<00:03:04.550> so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
of the line and the GPU is just so

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.570 
of the line and the GPU is just so
incredibly<00:03:05.390> powerful<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:06.140> no<00:03:06.860> games<00:03:07.370> are

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
incredibly powerful that no games are

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.460 
incredibly powerful that no games are
apps<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.940> really<00:03:08.240> take<00:03:08.420> advantage<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.170> so

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
apps have really take advantage of it so

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.870 
apps have really take advantage of it so
I<00:03:09.800> mean<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.070> actually<00:03:10.130> bought<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.640> shield

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
I mean I actually bought the shield

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.910 
I mean I actually bought the shield
tablet<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.270> while<00:03:11.450> ago<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.709> Proms

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
tablet a while ago and one of the Proms

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.380 
tablet a while ago and one of the Proms
actually<00:03:13.280> found<00:03:13.520> with<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.850> was<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.180> that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
actually found with that was just that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.479 
actually found with that was just that
even<00:03:15.200> though<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.440> thing<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:16.070> far<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
even though this thing is by far the

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.340 
even though this thing is by far the
most<00:03:16.580> powerful<00:03:16.850> device<00:03:17.239> on<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> market<00:03:17.810> I'm

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
most powerful device on the market I'm

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.710 
most powerful device on the market I'm
driving<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.830> wise<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.730> know<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.150> benchmarks

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
driving for wise you know the benchmarks

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.699 
driving for wise you know the benchmarks
will<00:03:20.840> tell<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.170> same<00:03:21.320> thing<00:03:21.380> they'll

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
will tell you the same thing they'll

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.170 
will tell you the same thing they'll
tell<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.130> thing's<00:03:22.370> off<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.730> charts<00:03:23.090> in

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
tell you this thing's off the charts in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.240 
tell you this thing's off the charts in
terms<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.450> performance<00:03:23.570> but<00:03:24.050> very<00:03:24.709> very<00:03:24.920> few

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
terms of performance but very very few

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.160 
terms of performance but very very few
games<00:03:25.489> actually<00:03:25.850> utilize<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.450> power<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.959> so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
games actually utilize that power and so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.080 
games actually utilize that power and so
they<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:27.739> tend<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.519> stuff<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:28.910> if

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
they just tend to like and stuff so if

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.780 
they just tend to like and stuff so if
they<00:03:29.390> are<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> well<00:03:30.560> optimized<00:03:31.100> another

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
they are not that well optimized another

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.610 
they are not that well optimized another
thing<00:03:32.060> Sony<00:03:32.360> can<00:03:32.630> definitely<00:03:32.959> work<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
thing Sony can definitely work on is the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.009 
thing Sony can definitely work on is the
ergonomics<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.340> their<00:03:34.489> devices<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.810> you've

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
ergonomics of their devices so if you've

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.110 
ergonomics of their devices so if you've
held<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> experience<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.010> said<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.519> or<00:03:37.880> you

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
held the experience that said to or you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.090 
held the experience that said to or you
said<00:03:38.360> three<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.590> will<00:03:39.739> know<00:03:39.890> that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
said three then you will know that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.680 
said three then you will know that
they're<00:03:40.250> not<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.760> very<00:03:41.060> comfortable<00:03:41.570> to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
they're not really very comfortable to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.170 
they're not really very comfortable to
hold<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:42.800> example<00:03:43.130> with<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> HTC<00:03:43.760> One<00:03:44.000> and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
hold so for example with the HTC One and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.340 
hold so for example with the HTC One and
me<00:03:44.239> it's<00:03:44.420> got<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.630> really<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.080> nice

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
me it's got this really really nice

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.110 
me it's got this really really nice
curve<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.890> sort<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.070> comes<00:03:46.280> out<00:03:46.459> like<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:46.850> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
curve it sort of comes out like this and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.150 
curve it sort of comes out like this and
it<00:03:47.360> just<00:03:47.900> fits<00:03:48.080> very<00:03:48.410> very<00:03:48.680> nicely<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:49.130> your

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
it just fits very very nicely in your

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.040 
it just fits very very nicely in your
hand<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.239> same<00:03:50.450> goes<00:03:50.660> for<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
hand you know the same goes for the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.830 
hand you know the same goes for the
Samsung<00:03:51.709> round<00:03:51.950> or<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.340> LG<00:03:52.700> G<00:03:52.880> products<00:03:53.300> all

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
Samsung round or the LG G products all

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.540 
Samsung round or the LG G products all
these<00:03:54.050> phones<00:03:54.290> have<00:03:54.380> actually<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:55.040> know<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
these phones have actually you know the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.070 
these phones have actually you know the
manufacturer<00:03:56.030> spent<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.330> lot<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.660> time

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
manufacturer spent a lot of time

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.170 
manufacturer spent a lot of time
optimizing<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.670> fit<00:03:58.820> in<00:03:58.910> your<00:03:59.000> hand

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
optimizing it to fit in your hand

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.120 
optimizing it to fit in your hand
properly<00:03:59.360> and<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.750> think<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.440> bend<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.100> a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
properly and I think that a bend is a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.860 
properly and I think that a bend is a
good<00:04:01.310> idea<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.820> mean<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.060> curve<00:04:02.330> actually<00:04:02.510> does

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
good idea I mean a curve actually does

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.020 
good idea I mean a curve actually does
help<00:04:03.170> with<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.350> ergonomics<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.860> advice<00:04:04.190> until

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
help with the ergonomics of advice until

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.670 
help with the ergonomics of advice until
I<00:04:05.330> instead<00:04:05.600> I'm<00:04:05.720> one<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.930> these<00:04:06.019> really<00:04:06.290> sharp

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
I instead I'm one of these really sharp

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.410 
I instead I'm one of these really sharp
angled<00:04:07.220> edges<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:07.820> maybe<00:04:08.000> Victor<00:04:08.239> just

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
angled edges then maybe Victor just

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.699 
angled edges then maybe Victor just
curved<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.810> round<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.080> bit<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.320> still<00:04:09.530> make<00:04:09.680> it

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
curved and round a bit and still make it

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.070 
curved and round a bit and still make it
look<00:04:09.860> nice<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:10.519> something<00:04:11.510> else<00:04:11.630> sony<00:04:11.870> could

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
look nice so something else sony could

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.720 
look nice so something else sony could
do<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.440> really<00:04:12.620> separate<00:04:13.010> themselves<00:04:13.160> is

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
do to really separate themselves is

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.050 
do to really separate themselves is
actually<00:04:14.570> employ<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.930> dual<00:04:15.320> sim<00:04:15.650> from

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
actually employ a dual sim from

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.210 
actually employ a dual sim from
loyalty<00:04:16.419> into<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> zip<00:04:16.900> for<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:18.070> would

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
loyalty into the zip for and that would

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.580 
loyalty into the zip for and that would
basically<00:04:18.430> mean<00:04:18.959> allowing<00:04:19.959> people<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.350> put

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
basically mean allowing people to put

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.620 
basically mean allowing people to put
two<00:04:20.769> different<00:04:21.010> SIM<00:04:21.459> cards<00:04:21.790> in<00:04:21.880> which<00:04:22.300> are

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
two different SIM cards in which are

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.750 
two different SIM cards in which are
used<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.080> different<00:04:23.230> regions<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.580> phone

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
used for different regions and the phone

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.310 
used for different regions and the phone
would<00:04:24.910> automatically<00:04:25.419> decide<00:04:25.810> which<00:04:26.020> region

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
would automatically decide which region

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.230 
would automatically decide which region
they're<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.919> switched<00:04:27.310> SIM<00:04:27.700> depending<00:04:28.150> on

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
they're in and switched SIM depending on

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.730 
they're in and switched SIM depending on
what<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.480> are<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.500> would<00:04:29.620> basically

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
what you are and that would basically

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.620 
what you are and that would basically
avoid<00:04:30.370> running<00:04:30.639> costs<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.389> make

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
avoid running costs and make

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.060 
avoid running costs and make
international<00:04:32.050> calls<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.620> hell<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.950> lot

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
international calls a hell of a lot

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.030 
international calls a hell of a lot
cheaper<00:04:33.389> so<00:04:34.389> I<00:04:34.720> mean<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.530> kind<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.800> not<00:04:35.919> an

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
cheaper so I mean this is kind of not an

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.440 
cheaper so I mean this is kind of not an
expensive<00:04:36.460> thing<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:36.940> mean<00:04:37.120> even<00:04:37.360> these

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
expensive thing to do I mean even these

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.870 
expensive thing to do I mean even these
set<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.720> $20<00:04:38.260> china<00:04:38.620> firms<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.040> buy<00:04:39.220> half

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
set of $20 china firms you buy half

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.310 
set of $20 china firms you buy half
they're<00:04:40.060> already<00:04:40.270> built<00:04:40.540> into<00:04:40.750> them<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.020> this

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
they're already built into them so this

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.659 
they're already built into them so this
is<00:04:41.380> definitely<00:04:41.770> something<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.460> can

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
is definitely something so you can

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.250 
is definitely something so you can
easily<00:04:42.850> do<00:04:43.240> now<00:04:43.450> there<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.720> also<00:04:44.050> something

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
easily do now there is also something

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.600 
easily do now there is also something
that's<00:04:44.500> been<00:04:44.620> really<00:04:45.010> really<00:04:45.160> bugging<00:04:45.430> me

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that's been really really bugging me

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.820 
that's been really really bugging me
about<00:04:45.880> this<00:04:46.000> whole<00:04:46.150> experience<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:47.020> that

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
about this whole experience is that

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.170 
about this whole experience is that
they've<00:04:47.950> got<00:04:47.980> ridiculously<00:04:48.700> high<00:04:48.940> megapixel

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
they've got ridiculously high megapixel

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.540 
they've got ridiculously high megapixel
count<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.139> all<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.500> these<00:04:50.620> phones<00:04:50.889> they're

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
count so all of these phones they're

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.670 
count so all of these phones they're
coming<00:04:51.760> out<00:04:51.880> with<00:04:51.910> like<00:04:52.060> 20<00:04:52.690> plus<00:04:52.930> megapixels

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
coming out with like 20 plus megapixels

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.700 
coming out with like 20 plus megapixels
and<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.639> total<00:04:55.330> waste<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:56.380> as<00:04:56.500> we've

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
and that is a total waste so as we've

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.020 
and that is a total waste so as we've
seen<00:04:56.889> with<00:04:57.070> phones<00:04:57.280> like<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> one<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:57.760> made

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
seen with phones like the one I made

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.210 
seen with phones like the one I made
even<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.810> four<00:04:59.050> megapixel<00:04:59.590> camera<00:04:59.919> can<00:05:00.100> produce

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
even a four megapixel camera can produce

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.159 
even a four megapixel camera can produce
really<00:05:00.760> really<00:05:00.940> good<00:05:01.120> images<00:05:01.479> if<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.810> lens<00:05:02.020> is

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
really really good images if the lens is

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.350 
really really good images if the lens is
good<00:05:02.380> enough<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.370> mean<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:04.060> know<00:05:04.210> for

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
good enough so I mean you know for

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.210 
good enough so I mean you know for
Xperia<00:05:04.840> phones<00:05:05.110> especially<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.919> day<00:05:05.979> and

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
Xperia phones especially in this day and

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.129 
Xperia phones especially in this day and
age<00:05:06.310> anything<00:05:07.210> over<00:05:07.479> about<00:05:07.510> 8<00:05:07.900> or<00:05:07.930> 9

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
age anything over about 8 or 9

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.350 
age anything over about 8 or 9
megapixels<00:05:08.919> is<00:05:09.040> totally<00:05:09.460> being<00:05:09.669> wasted<00:05:10.120> and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
megapixels is totally being wasted and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.600 
megapixels is totally being wasted and
in<00:05:10.930> some<00:05:11.110> cases<00:05:11.320> can<00:05:11.680> actually<00:05:11.950> disadvantage

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
in some cases can actually disadvantage

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.700 
in some cases can actually disadvantage
the<00:05:12.760> phone<00:05:12.970> because<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:14.020> know<00:05:14.139> there's<00:05:14.650> just

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
the phone because you know there's just

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.379 
the phone because you know there's just
not<00:05:15.040> enough<00:05:15.100> light<00:05:15.580> there<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.060> actually

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
not enough light there to actually

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.150 
not enough light there to actually
utilize<00:05:16.690> those<00:05:17.080> pixels<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:17.919> get<00:05:18.100> a

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
utilize those pixels and so you get a

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.279 
utilize those pixels and so you get a
lot<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.400> great<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:19.180> then<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.690> cost<00:05:19.900> savings

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
lot of great and then the cost savings

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.779 
lot of great and then the cost savings
from<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.530> less<00:05:20.650> megapixels<00:05:21.280> can<00:05:21.430> be<00:05:21.520> used<00:05:21.700> for

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
from the less megapixels can be used for

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.969 
from the less megapixels can be used for
a<00:05:21.850> better<00:05:22.030> lens<00:05:22.300> larger<00:05:23.050> aperture<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.740> better

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
a better lens larger aperture and better

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.070 
a better lens larger aperture and better
software<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.850> so<00:05:25.210> eventually<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
software and so eventually the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.050 
software and so eventually the
experience<00:05:26.500> is<00:05:26.620> going<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.890> improve<00:05:27.250> okay<00:05:28.000> so

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
experience is going to improve okay so

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.219 
experience is going to improve okay so
the<00:05:28.180> last<00:05:28.210> thing<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.539> I<00:05:28.660> really<00:05:28.870> want<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.050> say

think they've just been resting on their

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.960 
think they've just been resting on their
launches<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.800> bit<00:06:08.950> they've<00:06:09.070> just<00:06:09.220> been<00:06:09.520> milking

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970
