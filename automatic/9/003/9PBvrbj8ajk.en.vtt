00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:01.150 

and<00:02:52.580> John<00:02:53.360> randomly<00:02:53.900> comes<00:02:54.110> on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.150 

you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:31.970 

change<00:03:04.850> lanes

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:56.460 

it<00:03:32.980> looks<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.220> he's<00:03:33.430> going<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.640> join<00:03:33.850> us

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.250 

my<00:03:57.040> only<00:03:57.310> suggestion<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:58.210> this<00:03:58.330> bus<00:03:58.600> would<00:03:58.870> be

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
my only suggestion for this bus would be

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.710 
my only suggestion for this bus would be
for<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> stop<00:03:59.800> sign<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.340> open<00:04:00.790> with<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.540> red

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
for the stop sign to open with the red

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.480 
for the stop sign to open with the red
lights<00:04:01.960> instead<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.530> have<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.770> goes<00:04:02.920> open<00:04:03.160> it

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
lights instead we have it goes open it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.720 
lights instead we have it goes open it
after<00:04:03.640> before<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.540> put<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.840> red<00:04:04.990> lights<00:04:05.200> on

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
after before you put the red lights on

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:19.280 
after before you put the red lights on
that<00:04:06.730> would<00:04:06.940> be<00:04:07.060> amazing

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.960
