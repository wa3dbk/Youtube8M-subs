00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
sizes and for random fries so you get to

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.450 
sizes and for random fries so you get to
select<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.539> sizes<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.260> want<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.280> box

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460

select the sizes that you want the box
to<00:00:54.699> range<00:00:54.940> from<00:00:55.059> so<00:00:55.989> for<00:00:56.350> example<00:00:56.410> could<00:00:56.890> be

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
to range from so for example could be

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.849 
to range from so for example could be
like<00:00:57.250> sizes<00:00:57.550> 9<00:00:57.760> through<00:00:58.059> 12<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.750> then<00:00:59.559> the

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
like sizes 9 through 12 and then the

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.880 
like sizes 9 through 12 and then the
price<00:01:00.129> i<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.809> lowest<00:01:01.989> price<00:01:02.440> could<00:01:02.829> be

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
price i think the lowest price could be

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.520 
price i think the lowest price could be
like<00:01:03.519> two<00:01:03.850> hundred<00:01:04.090> fifty<00:01:04.180> dollars<00:01:04.660> all<00:01:05.050> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
like two hundred fifty dollars all the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.340 
like two hundred fifty dollars all the
way<00:01:05.650> up<00:01:05.860> towards<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:07.630> thousand<00:01:07.990> dollars<00:01:08.229> in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
way up towards one thousand dollars in

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.609 
way up towards one thousand dollars in
above<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:09.700> comes<00:01:09.880> in<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.150> big<00:01:10.330> parcel<00:01:11.080> box
