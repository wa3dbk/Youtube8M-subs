00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 in this video we are with the key here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 such a bracelet 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 This is in my opinion the simplest bracelet 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.509
 which you can only weave out of gum 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.790
 loom bands you can weave it 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 and hands but on the machine seems to me more 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.050
 feng shui on and for many it will be more 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.380
 convenient so we need from the machine and 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 several gum first one 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.480
 position the machine so that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 the open parts of the bars looked forward 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 from you and here is such a diagonal 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 diagonal arrangement of the columns was 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 but we are only interested in these 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.590
 two rights of a row to the left row not 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 pay attention we do not need 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.980
 so now we proceed to the fact that we 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.930
 dress gum as follows 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:07.519
 so diagonally further from this column 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:07.519
 Here on this put on further thus 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.820
 so we continue 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:24.320
 dress to the very end of the machine 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 [music] 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:35.130
 ready now we turn the machine 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.370
 the open end of the bollards to itself and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.050
 Now we will begin to remove the gum 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.050
 from the machine 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.810
 take this gum 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 she has the bottom row and there is the top row 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.520
 top row blue gum bottom row 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.530
 green we need to shove a hook like this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.790
 way to pick up 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.869
 lower gum and removal from this column 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.470
 now we need to dress her up next 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.100
 column 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.320
 which goes left like this 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.080
 the column also has the bottom row 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.670
 it's an orange gum in this case 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.730
 we need this gum too bottom pry 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.540
 remove from this post and put on 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.540
 following 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.310
 here the purple gum is the bottom 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.330
 next we carefully remove it from here and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.330
 dress up the next bar 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:03:09.240
 and so we take off and dress 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:03:13.260
 gum to the very end of the machine us 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.770
 there was one column with a rubber band 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.680
 but I now propose to put the suspension 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.010
 so I take the suspension and first into it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.110
 wound a hook then take off this one 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.380
 the last gum of the last one 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.040
 column and stretch and and through 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.040
 suspension 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 and put on the next bar we 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.670
 secured suspension 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.060
 now we can here from this last 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.150
 drag column for easy drag and drop 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.790
 on some free from on this 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.659
 first let's say we do this in order 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.230
 to make it easier for us to put on a fastener 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:07.689
 we take a fastener and dress it on these 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.200
 two rezinochki ready to clasp with us 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.010
 dressed 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.530
 now we can remove all the gum 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.620
 holding 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.870
 bracelet for buckle remove all gum with 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:29.030
 our machine 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:34.430
 [music] 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:39.380
 we have one rubber left we have it too 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.510
 take off but here we do as follows 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.600
 the way we look we got 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.910
 how could she not double so we need 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.340
 to make everything double just take 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.460
 Now and then 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.910
 This gum we get double it 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.710
 and we are now putting in a clasp that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.140
 we were somewhere on the other side 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:08.150
 bracelet dress it with this side 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:10.400
 two rezinochkami ready we have 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.040
 Here is such a nice bracelet which 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.590
 very simple and fast lagging but 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.590
 which look spectacular on the arm 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.050
 especially if for example you can have several 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.080
 such thin bracelets put into the hands of this 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.150
 also will look good Well 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.690
