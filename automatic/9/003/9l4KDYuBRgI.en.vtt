00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.450 
flung me up into the air with the ground
and<00:04:30.870> then<00:04:31.140> lightning<00:04:31.470> struck<00:04:31.710> me<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:32.070> assume

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
and then lightning struck me so I assume

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460 
and then lightning struck me so I assume
that<00:04:32.490> he<00:04:32.670> can<00:04:32.850> also<00:04:33.000> rain<00:04:33.840> lightning<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.440> of

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that he can also rain lightning out of

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.810 
that he can also rain lightning out of
the<00:04:34.620> sky<00:04:34.830> as<00:04:34.980> well<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.310> gotta<00:04:35.460> watch<00:04:35.640> out

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
the sky as well so you gotta watch out

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.970 
the sky as well so you gotta watch out
for<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.110> pretty<00:04:37.380> much<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
for that but that is pretty much the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.640 
for that but that is pretty much the
mobzilla<00:04:38.820> himself<00:04:39.330> very<00:04:39.600> difficult<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.290> think

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
mobzilla himself very difficult I think

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.960 
mobzilla himself very difficult I think
is<00:04:40.740> really<00:04:40.770> cool<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.400> have<00:04:41.520> in<00:04:41.670> your<00:04:41.700> world

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
is really cool to have in your world

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.640 
is really cool to have in your world
although<00:04:42.630> if<00:04:42.810> he<00:04:42.930> was<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.200> your<00:04:43.290> world<00:04:43.470> he

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
although if he was in your world he

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.170 
although if he was in your world he
would<00:04:43.740> pride<00:04:44.160> kill<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:44.790> watch<00:04:44.940> out<00:04:45.120> for

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
would pride kill you so watch out for

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.180 
would pride kill you so watch out for

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
that let me just go ahead and die one

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.590

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
let's get us Taylor wacom and bam

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.280 
let's get us Taylor wacom and bam
this<00:04:51.300> tale<00:04:51.480> will<00:04:51.660> pretty<00:04:51.780> much<00:04:51.870> kill<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.200> in

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
this tale will pretty much kill you in

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.630 
this tale will pretty much kill you in
one<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.500> one<00:04:52.620> hit<00:04:52.860> but<00:04:53.040> that's<00:04:53.220> pretty<00:04:53.370> cool<00:04:53.580> I

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
one to one hit but that's pretty cool I

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.670 
one to one hit but that's pretty cool I
think<00:04:53.730> how<00:04:54.030> if<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.360> tail<00:04:54.570> hits<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.350> kills

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
think how if the tail hits you it kills

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.840 
think how if the tail hits you it kills
you<00:04:55.830> haven't<00:04:56.070> really<00:04:56.220> seen<00:04:56.400> anything<00:04:56.640> like

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
you haven't really seen anything like

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.340 
you haven't really seen anything like
that<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.090> any<00:04:57.300> other<00:04:57.480> mod<00:04:57.750> either<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.260> think

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
that in any other mod either so I think

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.620 
that in any other mod either so I think
that's<00:04:58.530> kind<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.920> cool<00:04:59.070> effect<00:04:59.220> also<00:04:59.730> but

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
that's kind of a cool effect also but

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
that's kind of a cool effect also but
that<00:05:00.780> pretty<00:05:01.020> much<00:05:01.140> does<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.440> for<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that pretty much does it for the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.040 
that pretty much does it for the
mobzilla<00:05:02.190> part<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.030> orespawn<00:05:03.390> mod<00:05:03.510> guys
