00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.789
 hello everyone I am days and welcome to me 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 channel today I'm going to show you how they are going to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 do with your macerated marigold the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.200
 Calendula is a flower that has 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.920
 very good properties for the skin 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.410
 because it softens it is healing 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.870
 also deflates that is why it is used a lot 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.650
 in people with problems of eczema or 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 psoriasis and for this reason I have 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.799
 showed how this macerated is prepared 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 People who have psoriasis or 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.100
 eczema 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.309
 This will help them a lot too 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.580
 It is used for babies to avoid 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 irritations in the ass or on the skin 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.699
 of children who are so sensitive and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.299
 This oil can also be mixed with 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.549
 a little bit of jojoba oil I'm going to 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.369
 make this mixture because I'm going to use it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.010
 for after the bath I also have 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.930
 a very delicate skin and I have it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 to be taking care and in the winter by 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 example I have a problem that also 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.280
 me 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.590
 a lot of skin and that's why I have to use 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.950
 oils that help avoid these 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.659
 excesses 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.409
 of dryness in my skin so we're going to 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 prepare it and they will have it ready 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.969
 to use it at any time even 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.530
 You can also use it for your face as 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.259
 we have prepared it with oil 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.229
 almonds even people who 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.850
 they have acne even if it's an oil 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.090
 can use because that is going to 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.539
 Help soften and reduce inflammation when 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.780
 there is a lot of irritation because the oils 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.140
 vegetables unlike the products 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.569
 commercials do not cover the pore and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 absorbs very well on the skin for being a 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.439
 totally natural product and without 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.769
 preservatives for people who 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.230
 they have extreme you can also add 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:15.110
 tea oil 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.480
 Tea tree or titanic as it is called 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 in English so I'm going to show you how 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.710
 we prepare it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.130
 so it's a little plastic bottle that 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.960
 has a dispenser 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.230
 he has forgiveness and he has this that later 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.440
 I'm going to put it on and it has this that turns 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.120
 to throw it out easily as I said in 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 previous videos as it is necessary 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.630
 have plastic jars in the bathroom by 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 avoid accidents because if it is one of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.590
 crystal can fall down and breaks me 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.069
 I use a funnel 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.780
 and a colander 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.319
 to easily pour the oil the only thing 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.349
 that is in bourg is very big and I have 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.690
 to be careful that I do not leave 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.640
 fall out 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.740
 I think it looks better here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.740
 then we are going to strain our oil 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.480
 and then you take out the petals 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:33.200
 Well they went out alone and this is going to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.470
 press so that they are extracted 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.880
 all everything 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.170
 the oil of the florets good 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.390
 I believe that I will have to return 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.390
 because I got everything 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.530
 and as I indicated them, you can have 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.690
 this has been very full 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.440
 let's go back a little bit 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.010
 and then I'm going to 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.739
 pour some jojoba oil 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.720
 I'm going to mix it and this is what I have left 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.780
 ready to apply after bath 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.910
 The advantage of jojoba oil is that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.280
 prevents dehydration of the skin 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.820
 because it serves as a barrier 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 because actually jojoba oil 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.440
 it's a wax more than an oil 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.950
 and good 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.360
 we already have our oil for the 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.360
 uses that we want to give 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.179
 thanks everyone can see my videos 

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:55.790
 Any questions or comments do not 

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:58.450
 forget and do not forget to rate 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.450
