00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.089 
something that happened or sudden change
of<00:00:23.430> mentality<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:24.350> think<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.470> started<00:00:25.800> serving

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
of mentality I think I started serving

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.419 
of mentality I think I started serving
better<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.650> placement<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
better you know with placement and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.120 
better you know with placement and
everything<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.439> retiring<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.529> bit<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
everything and retiring a bit better you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
everything and retiring a bit better you
know<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.630> generally<00:00:33.630> making<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.079> few<00:00:34.230> more

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
know just generally making a few more

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.670 
know just generally making a few more
balls<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.870> making<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> rallies<00:00:37.230> longer<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
balls and making the rallies longer the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
balls and making the rallies longer the
hearse<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.489> she<00:00:38.700> didn't<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
hearse so then she didn't really have a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
hearse so then she didn't really have a
chance<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.469> end<00:00:40.770> them<00:00:41.010> quickly<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:43.399> knew<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
chance to end them quickly but knew I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
chance to end them quickly but knew I
think<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:45.539> she<00:00:45.690> played<00:00:45.870> well<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
think I think she played well in the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.330 
think I think she played well in the
first<00:00:46.410> set<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:47.610> well<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.320> tough<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.219> get

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
first set as well so it was tough to get

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.209 
first set as well so it was tough to get
into<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.840> I'll<00:00:51.840> confident<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
into it I'll confident I you can you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
into it I'll confident I you can you
might<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> able<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> repeat<00:00:54.329> your<00:00:54.570> success

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
might not be able to repeat your success

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.279 
might not be able to repeat your success
in<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.410> thousand<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.890> anymore<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:57.289> think

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
in two thousand on anymore I think

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
in two thousand on anymore I think
that's<00:00:58.739> still<00:00:59.039> quite<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.090> mean

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's still quite way off I mean

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's still quite way off I mean
there's<00:01:00.780> only<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.109> many<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.530> against<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
there's only so many I against a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
there's only so many I against a
Japanese<00:01:03.210> girl<00:01:03.510> who's<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
Japanese girl who's done really well so

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.210 
Japanese girl who's done really well so
far<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.990> I've<00:01:06.990> never<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.650> seemed<00:01:07.890> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
far so I've never really seemed this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
far so I've never really seemed this

i'll<00:01:11.280> try<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> few<00:01:12.210> tips<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.200> coach

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
i'll try a few tips and I think my coach

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
i'll try a few tips and I think my coach
went<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> watch<00:01:14.010> her<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.520> bit<00:01:14.820> today<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.600> she

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
went to watch her a bit today if she

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.520 
went to watch her a bit today if she
don't<00:01:15.990> finish<00:01:16.229> before<00:01:17.009> me<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.670> um<00:01:18.350> yeah<00:01:19.350> I'm

don't finish before me but um yeah I'm

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
don't finish before me but um yeah I'm
sure<00:01:19.740> it'd<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.250> tough<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.840> seen

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
sure it'd be really tough just seen

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
sure it'd be really tough just seen
Serena<00:01:22.590> Williams<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> similar<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
Serena Williams do a similar thing to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
Serena Williams do a similar thing to
you<00:01:24.180> she<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.540> breakdown<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:24.990> her<00:01:25.200> first<00:01:25.470> set

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you she was a breakdown in her first set

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.740 
you she was a breakdown in her first set
and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.950> she<00:01:26.100> came<00:01:26.250> back<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> tight

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and then she came back to take it tight

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
and then she came back to take it tight
in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> first<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.799> mean<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.280> maybe<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> bit

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in the first set I mean it's maybe a bit

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
in the first set I mean it's maybe a bit
obvious<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.659> important<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> skill<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
obvious but how important a skill is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
obvious but how important a skill is
acted<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.640> able<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.090> turn<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.479> have

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
acted to be able to turn around have

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
acted to be able to turn around have
confidence<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.500> turn<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
confidence that you can turn around a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
confidence that you can turn around a
first<00:01:35.490> set<00:01:35.700> rather<00:01:35.909> than<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.240> waiting<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
first set rather than just waiting to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.920 
first set rather than just waiting to
the<00:01:37.680> next<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.040> yeah<00:01:38.790> i<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:38.970> watching<00:01:39.390> Serena

fought<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.670> books<00:01:50.670> arena<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.149> was

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
fought back and books arena which was

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.370 
fought back and books arena which was
incredibly<00:01:51.780> how<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> um<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.869> mean<00:01:55.229> it's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
incredibly how to do so um I mean it's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
incredibly how to do so um I mean it's
really<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.040> tough<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.759> say

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
really it's really tough to just say

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.870 
really it's really tough to just say
mentally<00:01:57.750> stable<00:01:58.110> enough<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.670> keep

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
mentally stable enough so you can keep

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.289 
mentally stable enough so you can keep
playing<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:01.579> keep<00:02:02.579> playing<00:02:02.670> solid<00:02:03.090> enough

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
playing and keep playing solid enough

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.969 
playing and keep playing solid enough
and<00:02:03.570> keep<00:02:03.930> trying<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> stick<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.619> them<00:02:04.799> until

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and keep trying to stick with them until

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.359 
and keep trying to stick with them until
maybe<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.939> make<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> few<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.509> mistakes<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
maybe they make a few more mistakes and

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.120 
maybe they make a few more mistakes and
you<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:08.759> playing<00:02:08.849> few<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.690> winners

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
you start playing few more winners

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.000 
you start playing few more winners
I<00:02:10.160> think<00:02:11.020> one<00:02:12.020> way<00:02:12.230> or<00:02:12.290> another<00:02:12.410> do<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.830> think

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I think one way or another do you think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.950 
I think one way or another do you think
Britain<00:02:13.580> will<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.900> champion<00:02:14.900> at

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
Britain will have a champion at

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.710 
Britain will have a champion at
Wimbledon<00:02:15.350> before<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.710> weekend<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.130> out

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
Wimbledon before the weekend is out

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.240 
Wimbledon before the weekend is out
hopefully<00:02:17.720> yeah<00:02:18.200> I'd<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.590> think<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:18.860> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
hopefully yeah I'd like to think so and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.410 
hopefully yeah I'd like to think so and
I<00:02:20.020> think<00:02:21.220> we've<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.430> got<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> good<00:02:22.820> chance<00:02:23.000> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
I think we've all got a good chance to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.750 
I think we've all got a good chance to
be<00:02:23.510> honest
