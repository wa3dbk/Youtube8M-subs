that<00:00:13.440> which<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.190> thought<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.730> mean<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that which I thought it was I mean it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.400 
that which I thought it was I mean it
was<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.360> awesome<00:00:15.450> gameplay<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.170> really

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
was an awesome gameplay it was really

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
was an awesome gameplay it was really
hard<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> mean<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> mean<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.820> did<00:00:18.029> on

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
hard to do I mean we I mean we did on

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.609 
hard to do I mean we I mean we did on
our<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:18.390> tribe<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:18.960> ridiculous<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
our first tribe it was ridiculous and I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
our first tribe it was ridiculous and I
think<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.010> very<00:00:20.160> lucky<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> fact

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
think we got very lucky in the fact

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.910 
think we got very lucky in the fact
people<00:00:21.630> were<00:00:21.720> playing<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.199> map<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.500> played<00:00:22.740> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
people were playing the map we played on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
people were playing the map we played on
and<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> fun<00:00:24.029> stuff<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.840> today<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
and all that fun stuff so today I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.480 
and all that fun stuff so today I
figured<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.920> would<00:00:26.010> bring<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> guys<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
figured that would bring you guys a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.839 
figured that would bring you guys a
gameplay<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:29.310> may<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.730> as

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
gameplay that is it may not be as

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.189 
gameplay that is it may not be as
impressive<00:00:30.179> as<00:00:30.539> weighing<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> domination

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
impressive as weighing a domination

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.780 
impressive as weighing a domination
match<00:00:31.410> without<00:00:31.619> getting<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> kill<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
match without getting a kill but it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
match without getting a kill but it's
pretty<00:00:33.059> close<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.899> 200<00:00:34.410> no<00:00:34.500> domination

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
pretty close this is a 200 no domination

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.630 
pretty close this is a 200 no domination
match<00:00:35.340> now<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
match now what this is actually a

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.100

on I mean why would you I don't know why

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
on I mean why would you I don't know why
people<00:00:52.530> would<00:00:52.860> search<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> 200<00:00:54.149> no<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
people would search for that a 200 no is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
people would search for that a 200 no is
something<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.590> kind<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.920> started<00:00:56.190> way

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
something that it's kind of started way

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.189 
something that it's kind of started way
back<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> Koli<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.030> whereas<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> shut<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
back and Koli for whereas you shut the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
back and Koli for whereas you shut the
other<00:00:58.289> team<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> domination<00:00:59.670> match<00:00:59.789> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
other team out in a domination match and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
other team out in a domination match and
we<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.629> happen<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
we just happen to do this here and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.599 
we just happen to do this here and
ground<00:01:01.559> war<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> map<00:01:01.980> interchange<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
ground war in the map interchange and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
ground war in the map interchange and
interchange<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.300> believe<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.589> easiest

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
interchange I do believe is the easiest

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
interchange I do believe is the easiest
map<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> 200<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.470> no

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
map to get the 200 now on because no

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
map to get the 200 now on because no
matter<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.890> side<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> spawn<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.880> spawn

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
matter what side you spawn on you spawn

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.080 
matter what side you spawn on you spawn
basically<00:01:09.810> equally<00:01:10.560> close<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.700> three

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
basically equally close to all three

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
basically equally close to all three
flags<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> other<00:01:12.840> team<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
flags as the other team does so if you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.590 
flags as the other team does so if you
guys<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> come<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.509> can

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
guys can go there you can come you can

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
guys can go there you can come you can
get<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.380> guys<00:01:16.560> off<00:01:16.619> two<00:01:16.920> flags

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
get you can get these guys off two flags

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
get you can get these guys off two flags
you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> probably<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.090> 200<00:01:18.479> oh<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> hard

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you can probably get 200 oh but the hard

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.570 
you can probably get 200 oh but the hard
part<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.680> after<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.220> three<00:01:20.400> flags

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
part is after you get all three flags

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.010 
part is after you get all three flags
beings<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> hold<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> entire

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
beings to hold on to them for the entire

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.929 
beings to hold on to them for the entire
match<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.979> fact<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.340> did<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> ground

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
match and the fact we did this in ground

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.130
