00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
I was just like really nervous at first

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.020 
I was just like really nervous at first
I'm<00:03:26.600> getting<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.050> because<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.920> never<00:03:28.640> had

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
I'm getting this because I never had

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.610 
I'm getting this because I never had
white<00:03:29.330> hair<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.870> was<00:03:29.990> like<00:03:30.110> how<00:03:30.290> would<00:03:30.350> this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
white hair and I was like how would this

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.880 
white hair and I was like how would this
look<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:31.130> me<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:31.910> like<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.690> because<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.170> top

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
look on me but I like it because the top

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.090 
look on me but I like it because the top
parts<00:03:34.190> darker<00:03:35.020> if<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.140> wasn't<00:03:36.500> darker<00:03:36.890> I'll

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
parts darker if it wasn't darker I'll

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.250 
parts darker if it wasn't darker I'll
probably<00:03:37.340> it'll<00:03:37.640> be<00:03:37.730> like<00:03:37.910> no<00:03:38.540> it's<00:03:38.750> okay

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
probably it'll be like no it's okay

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.070 
probably it'll be like no it's okay
but<00:03:39.710> since<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.520> top<00:03:40.700> part<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.090> darker<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:41.810> like

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
but since the top part is darker I like

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.670 
but since the top part is darker I like
it<00:03:42.290> more<00:03:43.300> yeah<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.570> just<00:03:44.840> wish<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.080> was<00:03:45.260> bigger<00:03:45.410> I
