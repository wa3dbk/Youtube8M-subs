I like to start off the season in a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.120 
I like to start off the season in a
specific<00:00:06.299> order<00:00:06.810> starting<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> most

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
specific order starting with the most

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.220 
specific order starting with the most
basic<00:00:08.309> items<00:00:09.059> first<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.660> build<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.960> strong

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
basic items first to build a strong

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.440 
basic items first to build a strong
foundation<00:00:10.309> before<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:11.429> move<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> more

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
foundation before we move on to the more

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.330 
foundation before we move on to the more
exciting<00:00:12.929> stuff<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.559> first<00:00:13.920> thing<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.280> teach

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
exciting stuff the first thing I teach

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.090 
exciting stuff the first thing I teach
my<00:00:14.759> line<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> tie<00:00:15.990> their<00:00:16.230> own<00:00:16.260> straps<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
my line is how to tie their own straps I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220 
my line is how to tie their own straps I
start<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.150> two<00:00:18.359> reasons<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
start with this for two reasons the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
start with this for two reasons the
first<00:00:19.470> reason<00:00:19.650> being<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.369> almost

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
first reason being that almost

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
first reason being that almost
everything<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.900> involves<00:00:22.439> holding<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
everything you do involves holding the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
everything you do involves holding the
symbols<00:00:23.250> by<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> straps<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
symbols by the straps so they have to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
symbols by the straps so they have to
fit<00:00:25.109> correctly<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.099> second<00:00:26.640> reason<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
fit correctly the second reason is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
fit correctly the second reason is
because<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:28.050> teach<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
because if you don't teach them how to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.800 
because if you don't teach them how to
do<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> immediately<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.510> stuck

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
do it immediately you will be stuck

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.780 
do it immediately you will be stuck
