00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
to import yarn like 3d text from cinema

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.440 
to import yarn like 3d text from cinema
4d<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.990> can<00:01:20.170> do<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:20.380> by<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.759> dropping<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.299> in

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
4d you can do so by just dropping it in

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.870 
4d you can do so by just dropping it in
now<00:01:22.840> as<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.799> can<00:01:23.920> see<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.520> color<00:01:24.789> of

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
now as you can see this is the color of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080 
now as you can see this is the color of
my<00:01:24.969> texts<00:01:25.359> now<00:01:26.490> anything<00:01:27.490> under<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> hue<00:01:28.060> and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
my texts now anything under the hue and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.199 
my texts now anything under the hue and
saturation<00:01:28.209> will<00:01:29.109> change<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.679> color<00:01:29.889> of<00:01:30.209> the

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
saturation will change the color of the

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:34.199 
saturation will change the color of the
object<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:32.079> that<00:01:32.380> looks<00:01:33.340> pretty<00:01:33.399> nice<00:01:33.700> if<00:01:34.060> I

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
object so that looks pretty nice if I

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.989 
object so that looks pretty nice if I
and<00:01:34.389> resize<00:01:34.779> that<00:01:35.079> and<00:01:35.319> I<00:01:35.829> can<00:01:36.549> put<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.819> down

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
and resize that and I can put that down

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.179 
and resize that and I can put that down
the<00:01:37.149> side<00:01:37.420> or<00:01:37.450> whatever<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:41.469> I'm<00:01:41.619> rushing<00:01:42.069> this

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
the side or whatever so I'm rushing this

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.169 
the side or whatever so I'm rushing this
really<00:01:42.579> but<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.200> put<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.590> over<00:01:44.740> there

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
really but you just put that over there

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.339 
really but you just put that over there
if<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.240> don't<00:01:46.479> want<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:46.779> that<00:01:46.810> color<00:01:47.049> you<00:01:47.200> can

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
if you don't want it that color you can

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.429 
if you don't want it that color you can
put<00:01:47.499> it<00:01:47.590> above<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:49.270> change<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.869> color<00:01:50.109> if<00:01:50.349> you

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
put it above to change the color if you

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.379 
put it above to change the color if you
don't<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.919> purple<00:01:51.340> which<00:01:52.060> should<00:01:52.270> be

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
don't like the purple which should be

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:53.639 
don't like the purple which should be
pretty<00:01:52.569> stupid<00:01:52.899> if<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.200> don't<00:01:53.380> because

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
pretty stupid if you don't because

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.489 
pretty stupid if you don't because
purple<00:01:54.099> is<00:01:54.249> a<00:01:54.279> beast<00:01:54.549> color<00:01:55.029> I<00:01:55.299> just<00:01:56.200> come<00:01:56.349> over

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
purple is a beast color I just come over

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.649 
purple is a beast color I just come over
to<00:01:56.590> hue<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.159> saturation<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:58.029> up<00:01:58.299> here<00:01:58.539> you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
to hue and saturation and up here you

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.559 
to hue and saturation and up here you
can<00:01:58.719> just<00:01:58.810> change<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.549> color<00:02:01.029> to<00:02:01.149> what<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
can just change the color to what you

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.800 
can just change the color to what you
like<00:02:01.599> best<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.349> think<00:02:02.380> either<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.950> purple<00:02:03.549> or

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810

brownie<00:02:04.810> red<00:02:05.789> looks<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.029> best<00:02:07.239> that's<00:02:07.810> just

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
brownie red looks the best that's just

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.040 
brownie red looks the best that's just
my<00:02:08.229> personal<00:02:08.709> opinion<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.690> honestly<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.899> up

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
my personal opinion but honestly it's up
