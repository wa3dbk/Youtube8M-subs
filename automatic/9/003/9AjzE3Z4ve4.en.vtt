00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.090
 so it's just barber like I said 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.690
 ariel in niterÃ³i that a half race 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.269
 good very bad 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.319
 this impact 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.399
 suck blood feeds on blood 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.429
 of wild animals of domestic animals I did not do so well 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.429
 noting that deleting 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.589
 he prefers to stay 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.339
 between the lines were more than 30 years or more 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.489
 parts 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.309
 the patient with the Chavez disease presents in the chronic phase some 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.749
 symptoms like academic riviera 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.469
 the increase of the heart but we also consider the increase of the liver 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.640
 changes 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.030
 in ideli blood circulation on the premises 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 and this patient is slowly reducing these activities 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 so today there are many treatments that will 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.790
 controlling the disease 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 but the grabs that are diminishing these activities 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.120
 physical 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.790
 due to the increase in the number of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.539
 and 30 years old one with 11 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 in this circulatory system this nervous system also 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 now another very important disease a disease that is very serious is the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.440
 malaria 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.770
 and we're going to start a little just putting the symptoms of this disease and its 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.570
 biological symptoms 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.240
 remembering that malaria is also caused by a protozoan 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 and recognized as a modern country that is a protozoan genius that causes 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.270
 malaria 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.930
 it's the plasmodium 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980
 Let's meet a little more requested malaria. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.939
 then malaria it is transmitted by a mosquito 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.509
 we are celebrating 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.729
 we now have a center of a person with 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.290
 the protozoan forms of the plasmodium in the bloodstream 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 so I searched for new films class also known as skate nail 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 I'm leaving an infected person 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.780
 with the now protozoan forms 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.880
 kakÃ¡ in a mosquito digestive tract 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700
 so now to Mayan 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.200
 use goals 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.229
 male 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.400
 unfortunately 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.519
 so we're going to have funasa now 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.840
 the male and female gametes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.709
 protozoal pain 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.730
 reproduction of the pawn know that I am nothing happening mosquitoes 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.549
 cooper 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.879
 fertilization of the Xingu formation 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.029
 the zygote will now no longer settle 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.339
 nohl intestine 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:31.459
 of the mosquito 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.389
 and begins to reproduce 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.870
 forming now the forms known as spores the wii 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.570
 all 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.069
 with you guys are being violent 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 the spores and these spore vehicles the lituus 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.689
 ruptured the diseased cells had 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.819
 falls into circulation and will stop silence lar 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.559
 of the mosquito 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:59.469
 so we did not search for everything we have the cycle of sexual reproduction of the 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.389
 forget that this is important. 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.979
 then we talk to the 5th he is considered as host 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.079
 because I copied 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.749
 repression getting married 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.569
 now let's continue our team 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.049
 when I remove them 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.859
 sting a person who has no disease 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.819
 to probe the blood he did not with a home a substance before with the principal 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.320
 present in saliva 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.729
 of the mosquito 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.879
 this substance 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.319
 present on the leg at the exit that opens in the patient 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.099
 she who is cleaning up the ways expose subjects 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.099
 by exposing listeners to further 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.329
 from sandy 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.959
 person's 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.009
 who was not infected person who was bitten by the mosquito 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.829
 these forms now go straight to the hepatocytes through the blood are 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.409
 taken to the blue saw 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.589
 then this certain pact 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.179
 and reproduce in order to sec your life 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.070
 speaking the first or incapable 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.539
 the first show hits forms 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:11.629
 these surreal wind mere memos and now 12 400 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.160
 it does not seem but you forgot the scenes are mine and they also reproduce 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.370
 so it comes out of your mind 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.199
 forming novais - whiplash 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.409
 who are taking care of China if the 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.960
 invading new and softness 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.120
 do not interfere with the red blood cells we will now have the formation 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.210
 it is reported that they will later be Islamic 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.469
 female and male 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.680
 so folks at the moment we're going to have the breeding 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.419
 the wide section 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.430
 so we have less of the invading soft ipc 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.499
 bursting red blood cells 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.559
 play peacefully sweaty 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:57.590
 leaves in the red cells just rejected in bulk pack a new and soft 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.460
 by coincidence at the time they break the red blood cells 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.150
 for being different from the one that occurred the alarm session 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.360
 the patient has a 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.899
 fed about 40 degrees like intense sweating 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.930
 tremors 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.770
 and with this we are characterizing malaria with malaria access co 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.960
 which becomes repetitive 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.259
 of 48 hours and 48 hours and some patients 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.779
 in 72 hours and 72 hours 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.110
 and also from 36 hours in 36 hours 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.150
 dependents 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.730
 pass the plasmodium that is for the patient's check 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.209
 Now, let's go, so I will not let you forget the 

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:43.209
 Important details please note 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.039
 then malaria she has as intermediate host 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.069
 The man 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.379
 in this respect with reproduction 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.020
 to your life 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.740
 after catching definite is a mosquito 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.080
 and transmission occurs through the bite of the 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.020
 moskito 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.499
 dollar did not 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.080
 then ask for hours malaria is a very important disease 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.810
 The main symptom is malaria access, remembering that depending on the type and 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.229
 a kind of plasmodium that is for the patient's zeca 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.210
 is that we will have here in the intervals denies felipa cesumar 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.139
 very well I would like this deep just a little bit more about diseases 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.259
 but for x victory caused by this protozoan cristina is a vitamin 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.289
 for important sectors 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.379
 Neither do I await you for our next biology class. 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:35.919
 even heavier
