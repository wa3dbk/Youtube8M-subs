00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.650
 small mod but quite useful and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 fun means so the first mod 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 adds a sticky torch 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 very very handy thing in the mines in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.090
 caves where really badly seen and not 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.790
 I want to risk somehow better quit 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 she stuck to herself there 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.640
 and here you are, and the light is very convenient 2 mod 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.410
 let you easily sit down on any block 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 even wear yourself strength look yourself 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.719
 cool shorter let's be 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 consider everything as usual more 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 so the first mod is we have a sticky torch 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.480
 it uses a slime clot and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.870
 an ordinary torch we get a sticky torch 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 it means so as to what for example you can 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.330
 turn on the night of the right key and throw 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.700
 thats all the torch is set again 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.439
 time here and so let's somewhere here give 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.540
