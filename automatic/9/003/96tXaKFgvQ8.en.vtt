if I'm not wrong this was about twelve
to<00:02:37.760> thirteen<00:02:38.180> dollars<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.019> it's<00:02:39.170> not<00:02:39.290> very

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
to thirteen dollars so it's not very

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.619 
to thirteen dollars so it's not very
expensive<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.370> maybe<00:02:40.909> it<00:02:41.060> was<00:02:41.180> even<00:02:41.450> cheaper

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629

expensive or maybe it was even cheaper
than<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.769> expensive<00:02:43.099> at<00:02:43.340> all<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
skin really seems to like this lotion

skin really seems to like this lotion
the<00:02:59.599> sad<00:02:59.840> thing<00:03:00.109> about<00:03:00.139> the<00:03:00.469> solution<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.889> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the sad thing about the solution is it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.069 
the sad thing about the solution is it
does<00:03:01.189> not<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.489> SPF<00:03:01.969> which<00:03:02.419> is<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:02.840> sad

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
does not have SPF which is really sad

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.020 
does not have SPF which is really sad
because<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.439> like<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:03.889> lotions<00:03:04.219> to<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.489> SPF

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
because I like my lotions to have SPF

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.659 
because I like my lotions to have SPF
that<00:03:05.569> way<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.810> could<00:03:06.079> just<00:03:06.109> put<00:03:07.040> my<00:03:07.159> lotion<00:03:07.370> on

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
that way I could just put my lotion on

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.059 
that way I could just put my lotion on
and<00:03:07.700> then<00:03:07.939> move<00:03:08.180> on<00:03:08.389> to<00:03:08.659> doing<00:03:09.109> my<00:03:09.290> makeup<00:03:09.469> when

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
and then move on to doing my makeup when

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.830 
and then move on to doing my makeup when
I'm<00:03:10.159> getting<00:03:10.250> my<00:03:10.489> skin<00:03:10.760> ready<00:03:10.969> but<00:03:11.510> because

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
I'm getting my skin ready but because

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.289 
I'm getting my skin ready but because
this<00:03:11.930> has<00:03:12.109> no<00:03:12.260> SPF<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.889> have<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.310> then<00:03:13.879> use<00:03:14.150> an

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
this has no SPF I have to then use an

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.080 
this has no SPF I have to then use an
additional<00:03:14.840> step<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:15.349> use<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> sunscreen<00:03:16.090> but

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
additional step and use a sunscreen but

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.729 
additional step and use a sunscreen but
that's<00:03:17.419> fine<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.349> book<00:03:18.500> this

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
that's fine because this book this

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.979 
that's fine because this book this
lotion<00:03:18.979> is<00:03:19.220> very<00:03:19.549> light<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:20.090> absorbs<00:03:20.389> really

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
lotion is very light it absorbs really

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.659 
lotion is very light it absorbs really
nicely<00:03:21.349> into<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.859> skin<00:03:22.129> I'm<00:03:22.250> talking<00:03:22.489> about

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
nicely into the skin I'm talking about

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.879 
nicely into the skin I'm talking about
the<00:03:22.760> consistency<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.959> absorbs<00:03:24.290> really<00:03:24.560> nicely

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
the consistency it absorbs really nicely

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.429 
the consistency it absorbs really nicely
and<00:03:25.129> really<00:03:25.370> quickly<00:03:25.699> into<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.090> skin<00:03:26.439> it

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
and really quickly into the skin it

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.170 
and really quickly into the skin it
moisturizes<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.280> skin<00:03:28.430> your<00:03:28.790> skin<00:03:29.000> stays

situation where dry patches appear or
anything<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.870> sits<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.349> nicely<00:03:36.500> under

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
anything it sits really nicely under

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.659 
anything it sits really nicely under
makeup<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:38.389> use<00:03:38.720> this<00:03:39.259> over<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:39.859> serum<00:03:40.459> and

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669

makeup and I use this over a serum and
under<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> sunscreen<00:03:41.659> and<00:03:41.989> then<00:03:42.169> I<00:03:42.229> put<00:03:42.379> my

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
under a sunscreen and then I put my

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.159 
under a sunscreen and then I put my
makeup<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:42.949> and<00:03:43.159> my<00:03:43.609> face<00:03:43.849> doesn't<00:03:44.449> get<00:03:44.629> really

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
makeup on and my face doesn't get really

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.379 
makeup on and my face doesn't get really
clogged<00:03:46.069> or<00:03:46.370> anything<00:03:46.609> like<00:03:46.909> that<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.329> do

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
clogged or anything like that and I do

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.909 
clogged or anything like that and I do
not<00:03:47.629> find<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.169> makes<00:03:48.319> my<00:03:48.439> makeup<00:03:48.620> move

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
not find that it makes my makeup move

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.309 
not find that it makes my makeup move
around<00:03:49.220> or<00:03:49.519> anything<00:03:49.879> it<00:03:50.180> sinks<00:03:50.509> right<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.049> and

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
around or anything it sinks right in and

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.499 
around or anything it sinks right in and
the<00:03:51.889> sunscreen<00:03:52.370> sits<00:03:52.609> really<00:03:52.759> nicely<00:03:52.879> on<00:03:53.329> top

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:53.509 
the sunscreen sits really nicely on top

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.039 
the sunscreen sits really nicely on top
of<00:03:53.659> it<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:55.250> do<00:03:55.549> not<00:03:55.849> have

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
of it so I like that I do not have

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.509 
of it so I like that I do not have
particularly<00:03:57.049> sensitive<00:03:57.500> skin<00:03:57.919> I<00:03:58.099> just<00:03:58.129> have

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
particularly sensitive skin I just have

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.420 
particularly sensitive skin I just have
dry<00:03:58.849> skin<00:03:59.209> but<00:03:59.810> even<00:04:00.319> after<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.709> exfoliate

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
dry skin but even after I exfoliate

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.640 
dry skin but even after I exfoliate
sometimes<00:04:01.970> when<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.599> exfoliate<00:04:03.169> if<00:04:03.319> I<00:04:03.439> use

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
sometimes when I exfoliate if I use

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.429 
sometimes when I exfoliate if I use
certain<00:04:04.099> skin<00:04:04.909> precise<00:04:05.419> ID<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:05.989> can<00:04:06.169> feel<00:04:06.409> like

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
certain skin precise ID I can feel like

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.129 
certain skin precise ID I can feel like
they<00:04:06.709> burn<00:04:07.009> my<00:04:07.250> skin<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:08.239> does<00:04:08.449> not<00:04:08.659> cause

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
they burn my skin this does not cause

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.770

any<00:04:09.319> kind<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.859> irritation<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.150> really<00:04:11.569> like

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
any kind of irritation so I really like

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.920 
any kind of irritation so I really like
that<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:13.489> keeps<00:04:13.699> my<00:04:13.909> skin<00:04:14.180> really<00:04:14.359> nice<00:04:14.689> and

balanced<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.650> that's<00:04:16.220> great<00:04:16.669> so<00:04:16.909> I<00:04:16.940> have<00:04:17.239> no

bad<00:04:17.900> things<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.260> say<00:04:18.320> about<00:04:18.409> this<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.829> was

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
bad things to say about this I was

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.030

cuz I knew it was supposed to be really

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.690 
cuz I knew it was supposed to be really
good<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.620> that's<00:04:23.740> why<00:04:23.950> they<00:04:24.100> brought<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.460> over

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700
