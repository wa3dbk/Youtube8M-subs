all<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> place<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.869> call<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> coming<00:01:08.369> through

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so I think that is a good thing for the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.520 
so I think that is a good thing for the
club<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> future<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.810> John<00:01:12.810> Barnes<00:01:13.200> who

Cups<00:01:16.259> during<00:01:16.799> his<00:01:16.979> decade<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.700> hand<00:01:17.880> field<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
Cups during his decade at hand field is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
Cups during his decade at hand field is
also<00:01:19.080> confident<00:01:19.560> about<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> times<00:01:20.250> ahead<00:01:20.490> as

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
also confident about the times ahead as

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
also confident about the times ahead as
long<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.990> sign<00:01:22.290> another<00:01:22.650> front<00:01:23.009> man<00:01:23.250> can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
long as they sign another front man can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
long as they sign another front man can
see<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> sign<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> improvement<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.780> terms<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
see a sign of improvement in terms of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
see a sign of improvement in terms of
the<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.320> play<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.119> aren't<00:01:27.299> winning

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the way they play so they aren't winning

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
the way they play so they aren't winning
the<00:01:27.900> matches<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.409> deserve<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> win<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the matches that they deserve to win and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
the matches that they deserve to win and
I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.549> need<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.329> need

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I think what they need to do they need

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
I think what they need to do they need
to<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.650> last<00:01:31.799> third<00:01:32.220> create<00:01:33.060> an

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to in the last third create an

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
to in the last third create an
opportunity<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.500> score<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:34.860> goals<00:01:34.920> because

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
opportunity to score more goals because

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
opportunity to score more goals because
at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> moment<00:01:35.670> Luis<00:01:36.119> Suarez<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.509> doing<00:01:36.780> one

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
at the moment Luis Suarez is doing one

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
at the moment Luis Suarez is doing one
scoring<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.159> two<00:01:38.280> thirds<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
scoring so I think in two thirds of the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
scoring so I think in two thirds of the
field<00:01:38.939> Liverpool<00:01:39.390> play<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.720> they've

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
field Liverpool play well they've

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.840 
field Liverpool play well they've
buildable<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:41.040> they've<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:41.700> good

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
buildable from the back they've got good

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
buildable from the back they've got good
movement<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.479> cohesion<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> final

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
movement good cohesion but in the final

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.399 
movement good cohesion but in the final
