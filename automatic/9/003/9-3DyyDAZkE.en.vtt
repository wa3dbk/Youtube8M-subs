00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.549
 Welcome my dear friends 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.649
 the minecraft friends and all 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.410
 those who like minecraft in general 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.139
 I am here on one 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.450
 I say one server at a time 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.570
 completely new service it is nothing 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.730
 that has a following reason and that the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.300
 reason for that is that I wrote 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 I'm not interested in that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.609
 would have been with a minecraft server 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.759
 to be and to breathe as it were 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.800
 and yes the founder knows the customer 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.950
 just frustration because of the people the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.100
 bought the server right here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.050
 good automatics bought the server 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 I had almost offered to use 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 yes and I found that nice of him 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.170
 that you can use for the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 and yes the stuff is like this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 and of course you are welcome 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 join in and yes we see here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 Here are the rules this time 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.670
 yes and of course we are the one to these 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.090
 server can come so you have the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 possibility to play on this server 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 we give max mohammed on it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 agreed that ten people actually 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.049
 fit like 15 people 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.180
 will take on the ones on the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.850
 servers can not because a revision 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 All ten are among them all 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.930
 at the same time online are more like that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.659
 would have to do it for we can do it here 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 briefly ascend the world and one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.390
 I'll see what's going on here 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.360
 we see beautiful here, for example 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.520
 mountain landscape and so on and so forth 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.650
 we even have a forest boy around 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 So nor would even almost all the aim is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.880
 unique which is missing a bit now 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.560
 is still desert and a snow area in 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 nearby 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 but well that's one now 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.820
 other things 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.360
 and we'll see for yourself 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.980
 automatic opens up like you do now 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.400
 this server comes server 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.410
 I say it's pretty normal so you have to 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.180
 of course a certain maturity 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.190
 bring so I do not want anyone in 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.630
 necessarily exclude his age 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.020
 but there should be some 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.520
 mature exist because otherwise 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.530
 Maybe the same thing happens 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.350
 at that time with the good result on his 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.900
 server as a person or two 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.330
 believe have started the other way 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 destroying server there and everything remained 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.030
 blanc break 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.560
 and of course that should not 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.280
 be present so you should you 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 already be able to behave properly 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.330
 and of course the best is of course one 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 nice application to write so why 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.680
 you like to run on this server 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.650
 would like to write that as well as pn 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.510
 because that would be better for me or you can 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.770
 Of course, also write to an e-mail 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.200
 it wants to googlemail.com on the film set 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.120
 can also write to that, yes, yes 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.210
 which one is beautiful an application of the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.710
 name is always always a name like 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.810
 old for example since a small one 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.760
 Of course, your application took minecraft 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.560
 We also need it because we have one 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.120
 playing whitelist that means that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.740
 only people on it come on too 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.050
 this world can stand 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.760
 that will mean, for example, you have to 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.370
 In any case, an original version 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
 I think I own 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.290
 and yes, if we are women, for example 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.380
 you like it here on this server 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.510
 want to get on it 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.650
 Does not work because only you come on 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.480
 for example , her name in the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.580
 whitelist is a girlfriend is 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.100
 for example , not the name is then 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.750
 is not synonymous and yes so one 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.209
 little pretty application what me 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.709
 it is personally liked for example 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.000
 if you have an application for me 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.380
 if you send me some pictures of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.390
 So you send what you for example 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.100
 have built or it I had no 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.770
 be a huge palace or something 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.920
 because it can not be something like that here 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.860
 build and there would be already drink 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.810
 it is sown thrown even the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.060
 rule band including its built and yes 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.950
 So far here yet nothing is 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 server has just re-set it 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.090
 is thrown after me after drinking 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 and what should i do now a complete 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.330
 through the potions from the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.070
 since I came out actually say 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.489
 wanted so well as it gets here 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.049
 So with construction so theoretically it applies 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.260
 there are no fixed places everyone 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.050
 tree must or may anyone can build there 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.880
 where he would like to say so if she says yes 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.880
 I would like to build on the way because 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.320
 just goes here apparently many cows 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.950
 So please do not kill everyone right away 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.770
 indiscriminately 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.000
 For example, we are looking to build one here 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.710
 would like to drink beverage can before 5 1 or one 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 would like to build one here in the forest 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.890
 would like to build in series then could 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.790
 like to do it 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.550
 Of course it would be best if I did 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.770
 every 10,000 a field of apart 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.180
 because then yes, the world is even bigger 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.100
 and he has to calculate all the more 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.500
 and the more memory is possible 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.370
 so of course that's nice if lost 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:06.320
 you may reasonably be yours 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.960
 founds or what do I know and yes clown 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.370
 is actually not possible for example from 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.830
 Christians do not because the boxes in the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.960
 we all private so there can someone 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.180
 other to gray access except her 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 even if the placed and now 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.050
 we have again night and so still 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.010
 times short I Summary I know 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.650
 I like to do it twice and three times 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:36.320
 but double triple keeps it simple 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:38.419
 better than ever okay now 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.900
 get a message on the cap and that 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.840
 again briefly touched by pn or e 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.290
 mail per pn in bed directly to me as e 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.300
 mail to want the gamepad googlemail.com 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.729
 and yes in the message should be pure 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.169
 come in any case name malta 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.910
 probably a move why like 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.940
 wants to be there and 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.890
 building eg pictures of your things 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.480
 did you could be happy as 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.110
 video answer is to make my finger 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.330
 I do not care 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.670
 and with their forward eurovideo and 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.800
 yes it was definitely me 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.340
 I have no time for now 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.730
 set until the 15 slots are full say 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.620
 me once 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.690
 so first come first serve 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.550
 I just go and if the 15 because 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.340
 Tend to go away right now 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.330
 get rid of if someone maybe not 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.130
 times active on the server or something and 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.990
 if again the question is how long 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.730
 which the server is therefore only times only 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.410
 be two months because we first 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.240
 watch if everything works well with the 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.830
 People can also behave on 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.050
 the server and yes it was on everyone 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.230
 case of me see you here 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.720
 maybe on the server again 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.460
 Stop by as often as we can and yes 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.820
 will be back next time 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.820
 Zschau
