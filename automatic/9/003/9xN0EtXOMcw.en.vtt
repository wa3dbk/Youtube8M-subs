edge of the snare drum this is what

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.620 
edge of the snare drum this is what
sounds<00:00:48.070> like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.000 

there's<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.690> lot<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.870> fatness<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.590> sound

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
there's a lot of fatness to that sound

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.070 
there's a lot of fatness to that sound
now<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.580> second<00:00:59.000> position<00:00:59.330> I<00:00:59.420> would<00:00:59.570> use<00:00:59.780> if

the fundamental pitch it also is going

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.820 
the fundamental pitch it also is going
to<00:01:15.890> help<00:01:16.090> reject<00:01:17.090> some<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:17.990> sound<00:01:18.290> around

the snares is generally a condenser mic
in<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.869> case<00:02:06.080> an<00:02:06.290> scx<00:02:06.830> one<00:02:07.299> here's<00:02:08.299> what<00:02:08.479> it

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
in this case an scx one here's what it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:18.140 
in this case an scx one here's what it
sounds<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.100> top<00:02:10.310> mic

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.420 

here's<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> bottom<00:02:19.989> mic<00:02:20.230> alone<00:02:20.739> sounds

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
here's what the bottom mic alone sounds

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
here's what the bottom mic alone sounds
like

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:42.940

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.610 

generally<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.250> phase<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:45.000> flipped<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
