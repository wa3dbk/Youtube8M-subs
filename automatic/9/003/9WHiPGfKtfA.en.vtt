feature of this battery alright as you
can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.439> cell<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.860> here

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
can see this is not the cell right here

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.380 
can see this is not the cell right here
guys<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
guys this is right here is actually a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
guys this is right here is actually a
special<00:01:48.780> alloy<00:01:49.079> plate<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.070> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
special alloy plate it's very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.910 
special alloy plate it's very
lightweight<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> same<00:01:52.290> time<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.680> help

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
lightweight so at the same time you help

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
lightweight so at the same time you help
keep<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> battery<00:01:53.610> protected<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> poke<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
keep the battery protected I'm a poke it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
keep the battery protected I'm a poke it
you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.619> I'm<00:01:56.100> actually<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.520> pushing<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can see I'm actually just pushing a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
you can see I'm actually just pushing a
hard<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.350> puncture<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hard and it's not gonna puncture the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
hard and it's not gonna puncture the
battery<00:01:59.310> compared<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> other<00:02:00.270> batteries

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
battery compared to the other batteries

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
battery compared to the other batteries
without<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> metal<00:02:01.259> plate<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> guys<00:02:02.430> are

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
without the metal plate so you guys are

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580 
without the metal plate so you guys are
not<00:02:02.579> even<00:02:02.640> dare<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> take<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> pin<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
not even dare to take a pin and just you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.050 
not even dare to take a pin and just you
know<00:02:04.619> stab<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.189> other<00:02:05.310> batteries<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.850> there

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
know stab the other batteries out there

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
know stab the other batteries out there
you<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.719> metal<00:02:06.960> plate<00:02:07.200> protects<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
you see this metal plate protects the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550 
you see this metal plate protects the
battery<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.690> up<00:02:09.690> next<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
battery and up next I have here is a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
battery and up next I have here is a
very<00:02:10.950> sharp<00:02:11.160> exacto<00:02:11.700> knife<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.690> guys

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
very sharp exacto knife so you guys

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.940 
very sharp exacto knife so you guys
might<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.560> guys<00:02:13.650> should

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
might now you guys should

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.110 
might now you guys should
not<00:02:14.040> actually<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.879> just<00:02:14.910> for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
not actually do this is just for

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.610 
not actually do this is just for

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
try this at home guys I'm poking it and

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.509 
try this at home guys I'm poking it and
it's<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.500> puncture<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> better<00:02:23.280> at

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
poking at the special alloy plate but

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350 
poking at the special alloy plate but
the<00:02:28.560> battery<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.550> light<00:02:29.730> post<00:02:29.970> cell<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.239> here

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the battery the light post cell in here

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.930 
the battery the light post cell in here
is<00:02:30.510> still<00:02:30.870> well<00:02:31.230> protected<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.069> there's<00:02:32.730> in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
is still well protected and there's in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.180 
is still well protected and there's in
this<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.840> both<00:02:34.140> sides<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.860> bottom

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
this on both sides you have the bottom

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.870 
this on both sides you have the bottom
right<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.390> top<00:02:36.599> as<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.080> see

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
right here in the top as you can see

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.789 
right here in the top as you can see
bottom<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.000> top<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.360> helps<00:02:39.569> keep<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.110> helps

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
bottom and top it helps keep it helps

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.460 
bottom and top it helps keep it helps
protect<00:02:41.269> these<00:02:42.269> cells<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.810> inside<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
protect these cells and the inside and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500 
protect these cells and the inside and
not<00:02:44.099> only<00:02:44.250> does<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.549> help<00:02:44.760> protect<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.299> cells

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
not only does it help protect the cells

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.930 
not only does it help protect the cells
it<00:02:45.750> helps<00:02:45.989> keep<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:47.190> battery<00:02:47.400> cooler

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
it helps keep the the battery cooler

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.729 
it helps keep the the battery cooler
when<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.599> battery<00:02:48.900> does<00:02:49.110> get<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> little<00:02:49.440> warm

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
when the battery does get a little warm

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
when the battery does get a little warm
so<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.489> special<00:02:50.910> alloy<00:02:51.030> plates<00:02:51.239> help<00:02:51.660> draw

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
so the special alloy plates help draw

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.600 
so the special alloy plates help draw
the<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.709> temperature<00:02:52.980> away<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the the temperature away from the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.979 
the the temperature away from the
battery<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.060> helps<00:02:54.299> keep<00:02:54.329> everything<00:02:54.720> nice

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
battery so it helps keep everything nice

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.559 
battery so it helps keep everything nice
and<00:02:55.170> cool<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:56.670> there<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.120> guys

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
and cool so there you go guys

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.420 
and cool so there you go guys
this<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.200> new<00:02:58.319> skylight<00:02:58.769> pool<00:02:58.980> available

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
this is the new skylight pool available

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
this is the new skylight pool available
