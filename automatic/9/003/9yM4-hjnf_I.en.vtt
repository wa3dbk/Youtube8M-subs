we<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.650> couple<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> data<00:00:23.580> sets<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
we have a couple of data sets when I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.929 
we have a couple of data sets when I

in<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> contiguous<00:00:28.109> range<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> keyboard

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
in a contiguous range use the keyboard

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
in a contiguous range use the keyboard

this<00:03:15.299> cats<00:03:15.599> case<00:03:16.139> let's<00:03:16.409> say<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> just

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
this cats case let's say that I just

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.610 
this cats case let's say that I just
wanted<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.519> select<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.120> cells<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:19.049> contain

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
wanted to select the cells that contain

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.089 
wanted to select the cells that contain
numbers<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:21.239> here's<00:03:21.569> what<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.290> select

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
numbers so here's what I can do select

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.399 
numbers so here's what I can do select
the<00:03:23.220> top<00:03:23.489> cell<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.239> use<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.989> keyboard

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
the top cell and use the keyboard

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.629 
the top cell and use the keyboard

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.559 
have all of my numbers selected for
example<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.680> want<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> apply<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:44.729> different

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
example I want to apply a different

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.020 
example I want to apply a different
format<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.440> well<00:03:46.709> let's<00:03:46.919> use<00:03:47.099> ctrl<00:03:47.639> Z<00:03:48.000> to

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
format to that well let's use ctrl Z to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
format to that well let's use ctrl Z to
undo<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:49.639> okay<00:03:50.959> finally<00:03:51.959> when<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.859> have

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
undo that okay finally when we have

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.339 
undo that okay finally when we have
created<00:03:53.699> a<00:03:53.790> formula<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.599> we<00:03:54.750> want<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.109> copy

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
created a formula and we want to copy

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.710 
created a formula and we want to copy
that<00:03:55.560> down<00:03:56.010> rather<00:03:56.400> than<00:03:56.519> using<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.269> autofill

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that down rather than using the autofill

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.599 
that down rather than using the autofill
and<00:03:58.439> going<00:03:58.859> down<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.220> running<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
and going down and running the

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.210 
and going down and running the
possibility<00:04:00.419> that<00:04:00.449> we<00:04:00.750> overshoot<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.889> range

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
possibility that we overshoot the range

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.210 
possibility that we overshoot the range
which<00:04:02.579> happens<00:04:03.030> frequently<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:04.560> we<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.949> do

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
which happens frequently what we can do

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.960
