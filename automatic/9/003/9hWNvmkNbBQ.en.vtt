00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
scaling when you take your dog to the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.460 
scaling when you take your dog to the
vet<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.720> they're<00:00:18.990> put<00:00:19.199> under<00:00:19.439> general

vet and they're put under general
anaesthetic<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.240> scraped<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
anaesthetic and and they scraped that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.599 
anaesthetic and and they scraped that
plaque<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.070> dentist<00:00:23.400> does

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
under general anesthesia and we didn't

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.679 
under general anesthesia and we didn't
want<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.090> couple<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.570> our

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
want to do that because a couple of our

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.900 
want to do that because a couple of our
dogs<00:00:30.900> were<00:00:31.230> we're<00:00:31.830> older<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.309> that's<00:00:32.669> very

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
dogs were we're older and that's very

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
dogs were we're older and that's very
dangerous<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.660> older<00:00:34.050> dogs<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.590> it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
dangerous for older dogs it's it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.000 
dangerous for older dogs it's it's
dangerous<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.309> younger<00:00:35.730> dogs<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
dangerous for younger dogs to the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.740 
dangerous for younger dogs to the
mortality<00:00:38.010> rate<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.250> general<00:00:39.149> anesthesia

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
mortality rate for general anesthesia

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.779 
mortality rate for general anesthesia
for<00:00:39.930> dogs<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.579> higher<00:00:41.850> per<00:00:42.210> thousand

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
for dogs is is much higher per thousand

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
for dogs is is much higher per thousand
instances<00:00:44.789> than<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.180> humans<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
instances than with humans it's just a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
instances than with humans it's just a
lot<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.770> dangerous<00:00:47.070> procedure<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:48.120> than

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
lot more dangerous procedure more than

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.229 
lot more dangerous procedure more than
more<00:00:48.840> dangerous<00:00:49.230> than<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.680> people<00:00:49.950> know

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
more dangerous than a lot of people know

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
more dangerous than a lot of people know
so<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> definitely<00:00:51.719> didn't<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
so we definitely didn't want to have

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
so we definitely didn't want to have
them<00:00:53.190> undergo<00:00:53.899> something<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
them undergo something like that that's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
them undergo something like that that's
that<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.039> dangerous<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.090> tried<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that was so dangerous and we tried this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
that was so dangerous and we tried this
and<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.750> worked<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:58.980> fact<00:00:59.190> we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and it worked really well and in fact we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
and it worked really well and in fact we
added<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.210> our<00:01:00.359> website<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> our

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
we know it works well it's not a quick

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.219 
we know it works well it's not a quick
fix<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> scaling<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> take

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
fix you know the scaling you can take

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
fix you know the scaling you can take
your<00:01:10.380> dogs<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.860> vet<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.970> come

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
your dogs to the vet and and they come

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
your dogs to the vet and and they come
back<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> pearly<00:01:13.200> white<00:01:13.380> teeth<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
back with the pearly white teeth and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
back with the pearly white teeth and
they're<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.280> ready<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.630> course<00:01:15.869> also

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
they're all ready to go of course also

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.450 
they're all ready to go of course also
you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you know they have to take the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
you know they have to take the
antibiotics<00:01:18.259> afterwards<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
antibiotics afterwards because of the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.429 
antibiotics afterwards because of the
possibility<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.390> infection<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.229> would

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
possibility of infection that they would

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
possibility of infection that they would
get<00:01:22.650> during<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.189> scaling<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.750> another

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
get during the scaling so that's another

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
get during the scaling so that's another
drawback<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.430> highly<00:01:26.850> suggest<00:01:27.479> taking

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
drawback but I do highly suggest taking

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
drawback but I do highly suggest taking
a<00:01:27.900> look<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> avoiding<00:01:29.759> those

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a look at this and in avoiding those

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
a look at this and in avoiding those
unnecessary<00:01:31.070> procedures<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.700> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
unnecessary procedures where they have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
unnecessary procedures where they have
to<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.060> under<00:01:33.390> anesthesia<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.439> be

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to go under anesthesia that can be

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
to go under anesthesia that can be
really<00:01:34.860> dangerous<00:01:35.150> for<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.270> dogs<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.720> they

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really dangerous for your dogs they they

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
really dangerous for your dogs they they
don't<00:01:37.350> always<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:38.970> sometimes

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
don't always you know there's sometimes

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
don't always you know there's sometimes
they<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.049> adverse<00:01:40.380> reactions<00:01:41.100> which

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they just have adverse reactions which

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.560 
they just have adverse reactions which
they<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> kept<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
they have to be kept in there for a
