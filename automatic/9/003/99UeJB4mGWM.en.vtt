00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that looks good and then over here we

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.470 
that looks good and then over here we
wanted<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
wanted to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.910 
wanted to
move<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.580> segment<00:02:15.580> over<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.019> audio<00:02:17.500> cue

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
move this segment over to the audio cue

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.670 
move this segment over to the audio cue
which<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.370> indicated<00:02:18.879> by<00:02:18.909> these<00:02:19.209> waveforms<00:02:19.680> so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
which is indicated by these waveforms so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.130 
which is indicated by these waveforms so
I'm<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.159> park<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> upper<00:02:22.629> portion

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
I'm going to park in the upper portion

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.280 
I'm going to park in the upper portion
now<00:02:23.830> I'm<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.790> click<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.810> segment

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
now I'm going to click on this segment

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.320 
now I'm going to click on this segment
here<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.739> again<00:02:27.489> we<00:02:27.610> want<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.849> match<00:02:28.060> our

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
here and again we want to match our

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080 
here and again we want to match our
visual<00:02:29.260> cue<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.620> putting<00:02:30.340> down<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.640> suitcase

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
visual cue of putting down the suitcase

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.850 
visual cue of putting down the suitcase
with<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> audio<00:02:31.959> cue<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.349> putting<00:02:32.620> down<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
with the audio cue of putting down the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.850 
with the audio cue of putting down the
suitcase<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.299> just<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> drag<00:02:35.650> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
suitcase so I'm just going to drag this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.350 
suitcase so I'm just going to drag this
over<00:02:36.069> slightly<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:38.879> then<00:02:39.879> we'll<00:02:40.120> go<00:02:40.269> ahead

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
over slightly and then we'll go ahead

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.140 
over slightly and then we'll go ahead
and<00:02:40.780> drag<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.410> over<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.920> where<00:02:42.160> our<00:02:42.700> audio

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
and drag this over to where our audio

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.080 
and drag this over to where our audio
cue<00:02:43.450> started<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.530> music<00:02:44.980> control<00:02:45.700> drag

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
cue started with the music control drag

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.930 
cue started with the music control drag
to<00:02:46.360> snap<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.110> waveform<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.730> see

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
to snap to that waveform so as you see

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.660 
to snap to that waveform so as you see
we<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.180> performed<00:02:49.930> four<00:02:50.349> operations<00:02:51.220> very

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
we just performed four operations very

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.809 
we just performed four operations very
quickly<00:02:52.150> just<00:02:53.049> by<00:02:53.260> where<00:02:53.650> our<00:02:53.920> cursor<00:02:54.640> was

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
quickly just by where our cursor was

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.750 
quickly just by where our cursor was
positioned<00:02:55.480> within<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.319> timeline<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.400> lot

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
positioned within the timeline so a lot

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640 
positioned within the timeline so a lot
of<00:02:57.790> people<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.269> work<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.810> way<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.079> as

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
of people like to work this way and as

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.410 
of people like to work this way and as
you<00:02:59.799> see<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.040> also<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.640> couple<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.180> other

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
you see we also have a couple of other

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.360 
you see we also have a couple of other
buttons<00:03:01.870> below<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.530> which<00:03:02.769> we'll<00:03:02.950> explore

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
buttons below that which we'll explore

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.220 
buttons below that which we'll explore
in<00:03:03.430> future<00:03:03.849> movies<00:03:04.000> where<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.870> can<00:03:05.019> actually

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
in future movies where you can actually

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.259 
in future movies where you can actually
have<00:03:05.680> lots<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> things<00:03:06.670> enabled<00:03:07.120> and

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
have lots of things enabled and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.910 
have lots of things enabled and
depending<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:07.840> where<00:03:08.140> your<00:03:08.319> cursor<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
depending on where your cursor is in the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240 
depending on where your cursor is in the
timeline<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:10.150> behave<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.690> different<00:03:11.049> way

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
timeline it will behave a different way

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.589 
timeline it will behave a different way
so<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.340> may<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.910> noticed<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.329> all<00:03:13.540> of
