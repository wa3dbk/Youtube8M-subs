00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 and it was time to renovate in the courtyard 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.679
 the garden terrace you saw that was 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.080
 cutest time out of it 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.289
 it's good that I do as a renewal 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.990
 jimenado if you bring me the father's lantern or 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:30.410
 the grandfather of my grandfather from Bariloche 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.599
 comes from bariloche and the wine that was 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.760
 destroyed so destroyed apart I grabbed it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.460
 ash volcano 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.859
 I had to clean it a lot but they were 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 completely destroyed my dad tells me 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.000
 you will not be able to recover if you can 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.979
 recover good we are worth to say that 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.829
 good on iron of course 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.710
 we can recover with spray this is not 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.079
 You can paint your here is how it was 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.449
 more or less be a little here that was 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.969
 destroyed everything rusted and what I did was 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.500
 paint it with black first I'm going to 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.199
 put on gloves today because I do not feel like it 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.659
 of staining is fine with gloves and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.090
 gas wear gloves and if you do not cream the cream 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.679
 white the cream gloves also then 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.500
 what I did was always shake well the 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:15.830
 spray and paint directly with black 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.710
 the fastest generous of black color 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.960
 black directly all black at the most 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.929
 it quickly gives a shine it gives it shine 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.880
 also if then what it does is 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.000
 leave you do not need that after 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.130
 varnish or passes or anything but 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.080
 you directly paint it to us like that but 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.600
 part how fast you paint very fast 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.880
 take it out not do not paint directly done 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 I would go to the lighthouse 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 better let's take it out with the novenas for 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.050
 have no problem and then what 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.040
 what I did was with silver 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.120
 silver color sprinkle a little like that and I'll 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.910
 removing with a cloth 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.940
 Look, it's still clear, I'm going 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.000
 removing with a rag and I'm taking out 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.490
 if they want they can also on the cloth 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 if you do not dare to do it directly 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.650
 on the metal with a cloth 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.420
 and you are staying 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.150
 it does not have to be dry 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.819
 completely or it may be a bit 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.549
 wet still the same paint dries very 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.950
 fast is not that it takes a long time to dry and 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.829
 more this painting was destroyed 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 it grabs if you do not take them out more then 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.569
 you're doing like a kind of skating 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.359
 about metal we have shown some 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.060
 times on wood very well and here on 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.250
 the metal is also very very nice 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 then you go like that throwing paint over 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.650
 a rag and you're going and as you see in a 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.989
 you are going 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.139
 look how nice with that metal effect and 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.510
 graphic medium seems like a 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.420
 medium graphite effect and then what 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.489
 I did was that you can pass more to the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.430
 edges also after what I did was 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.260
 with bronze you take this time use all 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.260
 with the cloth a little bit here cleaner 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.920
 as you are told you saw that it has as 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.970
 a few little buttons those little buttons 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:25.270
 I made them also like this with bronze I passed 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.120
 to the little button like that and it 's about wood 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.860
 wood on metal usually on the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.820
 pine wood is very good because you 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.770
 you agree that you see the sale of the wood 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.050
 oxidized a little the surface what 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.020
 let's choose a little 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.030
 we passed a very fine sandpaper and then 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.460
 a rag to take out the dust 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.620
 nothing more once you already choose it this a 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.710
 little bit to get more than anything if 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.350
 It has thick layers 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.610
 then grab if it happens is a sandpaper and 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:06.130
 then the iron gates too 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.440
 the metal iron is also what 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.180
 same is the same and then here what 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.030
 we can do is also pass and a little 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.560
 in the bars 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.260
 if we do not want a lot of paint and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.620
 that is as further away we take 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.650
 paint with the same cloth I'm going 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.950
 taking out paint and we are going doing so 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.020
 leaving a more aged effect I want 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.970
 that they see it because in addition I love 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.490
 this possibility of renewing everything that 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.350
 you have on hand and more in a metal than 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.040
 engineer in the gardens in the courtyards 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:45.010
 in the next ones you leave it like this if you have 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.860
 the bluff like new but as I say it was 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.110
 something that is impressive changed 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.810
 very much and changed a lot of everything 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.050
 which is metal iron also wood 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.540
 besides those possibilities of giving it a 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.540
 renovation to everything unless I loved it 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.500
 and if we get up to the bariloche 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.130
 thanks to the last 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.930
 paint kuwait synthetic enamel 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.190
 black sun for interior and exterior more 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.040
 40 glossy matt satin colors 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.590
 Metallized and fluorine the best 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.420
 results in any kind of 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.420
 surface enters painting remove point
