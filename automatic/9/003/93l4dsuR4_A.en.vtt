00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
of this then lean assassin like he fills

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.580 
of this then lean assassin like he fills
out<00:03:27.950> his<00:03:28.010> coat<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.150> just<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.690> warrior<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.320> every

the<00:03:45.410> animation<00:03:45.830> team<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.130> built<00:03:46.370> over<00:03:46.550> an<00:03:46.760> hour

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
the animation team is built over an hour

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.000 
the animation team is built over an hour
of<00:03:47.300> new<00:03:47.450> animations<00:03:47.990> just<00:03:48.260> for<00:03:48.410> Connor<00:03:48.650> alone

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
of new animations just for Connor alone

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.520 
of new animations just for Connor alone
we<00:03:49.760> started<00:03:50.209> by<00:03:50.330> looking<00:03:50.540> at<00:03:50.780> lots<00:03:51.380> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
we started by looking at lots of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.370 
we started by looking at lots of
military<00:03:52.160> moves<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.090> even<00:03:53.690> traditional<00:03:53.870> ones

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
military moves and even traditional ones

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.530 
military moves and even traditional ones
of<00:03:54.590> how<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:55.220> would<00:03:55.310> favor<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.640> tomahawk<00:03:56.090> we

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
of how you would favor the tomahawk we

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.940 
of how you would favor the tomahawk we
looked<00:03:56.810> at<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:57.380> just<00:03:57.680> thought<00:03:57.740> it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
looked at that and we just thought it

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.370 
looked at that and we just thought it
wasn't<00:03:58.400> awesome<00:03:58.670> enough<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.450> we<00:03:59.840> went<00:04:00.050> really

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.949 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really
brutal<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> wasn't<00:04:01.310> just<00:04:01.870> throwing<00:04:02.870> in

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:12.040 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in
board<00:04:09.819> we<00:04:10.819> put<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> lot<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.420> time<00:04:11.690> into<00:04:11.870> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
board we put a lot of time into the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.470 
board we put a lot of time into the
navigation<00:04:12.650> elements<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.310> we've<00:04:13.940> completely

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
navigation elements and we've completely

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.930 
navigation elements and we've completely
redone<00:04:14.989> our<00:04:15.170> climb<00:04:15.440> system<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.280> really<00:04:16.579> wanted

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
redone our climb system we really wanted

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.810 
redone our climb system we really wanted
it<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.120> be<00:04:17.329> much<00:04:17.510> more<00:04:17.540> organic<00:04:18.519> there's<00:04:19.519> so

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
it to be much more organic there's so

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.580 
it to be much more organic there's so
much<00:04:20.030> variety<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.660> what<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.900> can<00:04:21.049> climb<00:04:21.290> and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
much variety and what you can climb and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.070 
much variety and what you can climb and
how<00:04:21.799> we<00:04:21.859> can<00:04:22.040> do<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.510> Connor<00:04:23.510> moves<00:04:23.840> are

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
how we can do it Connor moves are

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.430 
how we can do it Connor moves are
directly<00:04:24.650> inspired<00:04:24.950> by<00:04:25.430> parkour<00:04:26.090> parkour<00:04:26.440> is
