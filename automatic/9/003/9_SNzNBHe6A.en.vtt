is<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> posts<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> post<00:00:46.800> set

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
is where the posts are and the post set

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
is where the posts are and the post set
of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> stuff<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.640> between<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
of the stuff in between that make up the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.610 
of the stuff in between that make up the
line<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.640> okay<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
line going up okay so if you think of it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
line going up okay so if you think of it
as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> tea<00:00:53.219> there's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> line<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> goes<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
as a tea there's a line that goes up and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
as a tea there's a line that goes up and
then<00:00:54.539> across<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> thing<00:00:56.670> going

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
then across so it's the thing going

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.959 
then across so it's the thing going
there<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.079> chain<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.399> matches<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there so this chain here matches the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
there so this chain here matches the
post<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> directly<00:01:01.440> underneath

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
post that is directly underneath

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609 
post that is directly underneath
therefore<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.149> stitch<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> done<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.470> we

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
therefore it's this stitch is done so we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
therefore it's this stitch is done so we
just<00:01:04.799> immediately<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> jump<00:01:05.610> over<00:01:06.000> to

where<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> edges<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.860> always<00:02:05.070> focus<00:02:05.670> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
where the edges and we always focus on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.280 
where the edges and we always focus on
that<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.329> beginning<00:02:06.780> tutorials

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that in these beginning tutorials

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
that in these beginning tutorials
because<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.979> people<00:02:08.250> don't<00:02:08.489> realize

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
because a lot of people don't realize

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
because a lot of people don't realize
where<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> edge<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.020> they<00:02:10.530> end<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.770> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
where the edge is and they end up with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.400 
where the edge is and they end up with
projects<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:11.849> trying

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
projects that look like trying

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.980 
projects that look like trying
because<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:12.920> can't<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.670> and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
because they can't really see it and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.210 
because they can't really see it and
though<00:02:14.990> I'm<00:02:15.200> working<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.770> really<00:02:16.100> good

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
though I'm working with a really good

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.350 
though I'm working with a really good
tension<00:02:16.670> because<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:17.150> I've<00:02:17.240> been

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
tension because you know I've been

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.160 
tension because you know I've been
coaching<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.380> 23<00:02:19.010> years<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:20.360> very<00:02:20.600> easy<00:02:20.810> for

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
coaching for 23 years it's very easy for

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.930 
coaching for 23 years it's very easy for
me<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.770> where<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.040> edge<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.190> because<00:02:22.790> of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
me to see where the edge is because of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.640 
me to see where the edge is because of
the<00:02:23.180> way<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.510> go<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.500> that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the way that I go and you can see that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.370 
the way that I go and you can see that
my<00:02:24.770> stitches<00:02:25.160> are<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.310> lot<00:02:25.490> looking<00:02:25.850> really

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
my stitches are a lot looking really

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.020 
my stitches are a lot looking really
consistent<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.100> your<00:02:28.280> stitches<00:02:28.670> won't<00:02:28.790> look

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
consistent but your stitches won't look

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.250 
consistent but your stitches won't look
like<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.270> if<00:02:29.600> you're<00:02:29.750> starting<00:02:30.020> out<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
like this if you're starting out you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.710 
like this if you're starting out you
know<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:31.220> little<00:02:31.340> bit<00:02:31.820> loosey-goosey<00:02:32.240> that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
know be a little bit loosey-goosey that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780 
know be a little bit loosey-goosey that
might<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:32.960> too<00:02:33.170> tight<00:02:33.380> there<00:02:34.280> might<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.550> mix

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
might be too tight there might be a mix

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.180 
might be too tight there might be a mix
of<00:02:34.940> both<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.530> very<00:02:36.560> difficult<00:02:36.890> to

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
of both and it so it's very difficult to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.250 
of both and it so it's very difficult to
see<00:02:37.370> where<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.610> edges<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.750> you're<00:02:38.900> looking<00:02:39.020> at

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
see where the edges so you're looking at

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.500 
see where the edges so you're looking at
the<00:02:39.350> post<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:40.010> post<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:40.640> matches<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.300> one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the post this post here matches this one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.420 
the post this post here matches this one
so<00:02:42.080> looking<00:02:42.440> at<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> post<00:02:42.830> there's<00:02:43.070> nothing

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so looking at the post there's nothing

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.980 
so looking at the post there's nothing
above<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.820> one<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.300> need<00:02:44.510> another<00:02:44.810> one

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
above this one so you need another one

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.410 
above this one so you need another one
there<00:02:45.260> nothing<00:02:45.980> above<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.300> get

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
there nothing above that one and to get

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.150 
there nothing above that one and to get
enough<00:02:47.720> nothing<00:02:48.230> again<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.950> need

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
enough nothing again there so you need

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160 
enough nothing again there so you need
actually<00:02:49.370> three<00:02:49.850> more<00:02:50.060> double<00:02:50.450> crochets<00:02:50.960> to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
actually three more double crochets to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.540 
actually three more double crochets to
finish<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.620> line<00:02:53.560> okay<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.920> got<00:02:55.040> no<00:02:55.490> you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.290 
finish this line okay so you got no you
need<00:02:55.790> two<00:02:56.030> more<00:02:58.330> go<00:02:59.330> through<00:02:59.720> two<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.400> two<00:03:01.700> and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
need two more go through two and two and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.360 
need two more go through two and two and
the<00:03:02.810> final<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.230> right<00:03:03.440> here<00:03:04.780> okay<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.370> you

want<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.610> go<00:03:07.700> right<00:03:07.910> into<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.270> stitch<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
want to go right into the stitch you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.030 
want to go right into the stitch you
don't<00:03:08.870> want<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.110> go<00:03:09.200> into<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.500> hole<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:09.890> go

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
don't want to go into the hole but go

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.670 
don't want to go into the hole but go
right<00:03:10.220> into<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.580> stitch<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.500> don't

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
right into the stitch so that you don't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.720 
right into the stitch so that you don't
have<00:03:12.860> any<00:03:13.100> holes<00:03:13.400> left<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:14.030> your<00:03:14.240> work<00:03:15.580> okay

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
have any holes left in your work okay

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.390 
have any holes left in your work okay
so<00:03:16.970> let's<00:03:17.209> turn<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.930> material<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.500> try<00:03:19.100> again

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
so let's turn the material and try again

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.000 
so let's turn the material and try again
so<00:03:20.150> we're<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.990> edge<00:03:21.140> what<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:21.800> have<00:03:21.890> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so we're on the edge what do you have to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.810 
so we're on the edge what do you have to
do<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.880> chain<00:03:23.150> up<00:03:23.180> three<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.200> one<00:03:24.820> two

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
do you have to chain up three so one two

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.310 
do you have to chain up three so one two
and<00:03:26.330> three<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.130> now<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.370> post<00:03:28.820> here<00:03:29.780> matches

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
and three so now this post here matches

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.170 
and three so now this post here matches
what<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:30.770> just<00:03:31.070> change<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.550> stitch<00:03:32.000> is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
what I just change so that stitch is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.030 
what I just change so that stitch is
done<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.900> now<00:03:33.050> we<00:03:33.110> immediately<00:03:33.650> jump<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.950> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
done so now we immediately jump to the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.030 
done so now we immediately jump to the
next<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:34.520> where<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.790> see<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.780> next<00:03:36.170> stitch

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
next one where you see the next stitch

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.800 
next one where you see the next stitch
available<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.030> wrapping<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.390> material

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
available so wrapping the material

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.970 
available so wrapping the material
through<00:03:39.190> two<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.790> two<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.300> now<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.830> work

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
through two and two and now we just work

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.540 
through two and two and now we just work
our<00:03:43.160> way<00:03:43.250> across<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.820> like<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.120> did<00:03:44.270> before

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.610 

it's<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:50.660> important<00:03:51.050> that<00:03:51.080> your<00:03:51.350> yarn

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it's really important that your yarn

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.200 
it's really important that your yarn
ball<00:03:51.860> be<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.340> side<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.850> in<00:03:53.030> whatever
