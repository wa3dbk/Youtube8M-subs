00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.890
 hello with you again killer 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.900
 paranoid 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:23.180
 and today we will collect a fire pickaxe 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:27.720
 fire pickaxe pickaxe that when mining 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.500
 may with a certain chance get 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.840
 cluster would cluster this in principle 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 improved version 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.630
 and it is improved due to the fact that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.010
 smelting you get 2 times more 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.650
 material that is, let's say getting 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.140
 remelting iron cluster you 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.220
 get two whole iron bars 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.350
 instead of 1 so what do we need 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.530
 need two fire crystals 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.470
 there pickax wood great tree 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.449
 diamond 8 heart ignis a 80 super fund 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.330
 ai-80 senses 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.060
 and stability imperceptible that in principle 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.550
 makes us happy 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:18.670
 go to the fire arrangement 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:24.080
 we put the crystals here 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.460
 diamond we put wood here 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.729
 great tree put here over here 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.729
 central pedestal we put there a pickaxe 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 again went away took thaumonomicon 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:48.380
 opened checked everything is correct 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.710
 we arrange banks with essences as 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 put in principle the difference is not particularly 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.240
 all then take the same room in the hands of 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240
 screw 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.740
 went first heart here went census 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 see grows here it means that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.530
 something went wrong in principle but so 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.730
 as i'm looking for my own enough we 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.780
 overcame this one's process does not need to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.790
 here is the first absorption of the second crystal 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 absorbed the runic matrix diamond and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.510
 the tree is therefore basically better of course 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 have a supply of essence here it is rare but to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.790
 let's go to me here just to eat 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 one ore basement try what do we 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.470
 pickaxe will do 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.150
 but in this case, especially nothing 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:05.140
 it turned out there is nothing to check 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:08.760
 let's try to achieve all the same 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.760
 result of some 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.090
 the main share here we need to find 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.940
 some way I will, so this is a ruban not 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.510
 completely help very well that I forgot 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.510
 candles 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:51.530
 so here is not what you need 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.740
 and here we are knocking and us as 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:01.810
 shows where the cluster is 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:05.230
 ore see principle we can listen 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 just about iron 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.540
 12 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.209
 and here is just an iron cluster 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:25.430
 remelting such a cluster will turn out 2 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:29.990
 ingot instead of one well in principle on 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.620
 this we end up not only 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.220
 as usual say goodbye to you all 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.220
 good
