and I've been kind of using it and now
I'm<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.860> trying<00:00:11.190> some<00:00:11.490> shingling

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I'm going to be trying some shingling

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.910 
I'm going to be trying some shingling
and<00:00:12.300> I've<00:00:12.389> done<00:00:12.599> jingling<00:00:13.080> before<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.769> see

and I've done jingling before my for see
here<00:00:14.160> check<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.639> below<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> link<00:00:15.540> but

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
here check it out below the link but

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.349 
here check it out below the link but
obviously<00:00:16.560> new<00:00:17.100> products<00:00:17.580> do<00:00:17.940> different

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
obviously new products do different

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.140 
obviously new products do different
things<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.800> testing<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.250> two<00:00:20.520> ways<00:00:20.699> one

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
things so I'm testing it two ways one

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.900 
things so I'm testing it two ways one
with<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.900> twist<00:00:22.199> buttercream<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> some

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
with just the twist buttercream and some

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
with just the twist buttercream and some
with<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.570> twist<00:00:24.930> buttercream<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.920> equal

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
with the twist buttercream and the equal

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
with the twist buttercream and the equal
style<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> Java<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.359> jar<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
style of Java like a little jar so this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.279 
style of Java like a little jar so this
is<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.400> getting<00:00:29.760> thus<00:00:30.240> far<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.840> just

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
is what I'm getting thus far with just

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
is what I'm getting thus far with just
the<00:00:32.009> twist<00:00:32.309> buttercream<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the twist buttercream and then this is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
the twist buttercream and then this is
what<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.020> getting<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.469> defined<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
what I'm getting more defined with a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.139 
what I'm getting more defined with a
little<00:00:36.030> bit<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> gel<00:00:36.540> added<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> um<00:00:38.149> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
little bit of gel added into it um so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.490 
little bit of gel added into it um so
I'm<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> try<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> gel<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.350> don't

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
what I'm doing in this process is that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
what I'm doing in this process is that
I'm<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:46.440> water<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.770> hand<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> don't

I'm just have some water on hand I don't

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
I'm just have some water on hand I don't
have<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> spray<00:00:47.820> bottle<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> squirt

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
have a spray bottle so I have the squirt

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
have a spray bottle so I have the squirt
jar<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.649> messy<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.850> just

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
jar that's really messy and I'm just

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
jar that's really messy and I'm just
putting<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.629> my<00:00:51.660> hair<00:00:52.020> saturating<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
putting that on my hair saturating it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
putting that on my hair saturating it
making<00:00:53.190> sure<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> wet<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:54.420> damp<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:54.960> wet

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.729 
making sure it's wet not damp but wet
and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> making<00:00:56.699> sure<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
and then going and making sure that I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
and then going and making sure that I
detangle<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.160> hair<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.340> dry<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
detangle because my hair is dry and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.369 
detangle because my hair is dry and
shrunken<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> extremely<00:01:01.430> tangled<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
shrunken so it's extremely tangled and

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.570 
shrunken so it's extremely tangled and
so<00:01:04.379> once<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.769> stretched<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.250> i'm<00:01:05.430> just

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so once it's stretched out i'm just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
so once it's stretched out i'm just
going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> take<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.150> bit<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.110> twist

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to take a little bit of the twist

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to take a little bit of the twist
butter<00:01:07.820> placing<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.299> route<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
butter placing that from route all the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
butter placing that from route all the
way<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.220> tip<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:13.159> then<00:01:14.159> i'm

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
way down to the tip and then i'm

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.630 
way down to the tip and then i'm
grabbing<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.150> bit<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> gel<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
grabbing a little bit of the gel and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
grabbing a little bit of the gel and
doing<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> exact<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.060> thing<00:01:18.570> route<00:01:18.840> down<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
doing the exact same thing route down to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.920 
doing the exact same thing route down to
tip<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.759> dimdim<00:01:21.090> brush<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> hand<00:01:21.840> i

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
tip now i have my dimdim brush on hand i

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
tip now i have my dimdim brush on hand i
have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> large<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.710> can't<00:01:22.890> find<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
have a large one but can't find it and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
have a large one but can't find it and
that's<00:01:24.060> why<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.360> important<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.080> detangle

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that's why it's important to detangle

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
that's why it's important to detangle
because<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> brush<00:01:26.820> through

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
because when you put the brush through

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
because when you put the brush through
it<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> rip<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.500> hair<00:01:28.890> if

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it it's going to rip out your hair if

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
it it's going to rip out your hair if
you<00:01:29.189> don't<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.820> detangle<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.720> i'm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you don't have it detangle so i'm

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.069 
you don't have it detangle so i'm
basically<00:01:31.159> running<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> product<00:01:32.759> through

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
basically running the product through

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
basically running the product through
and<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.590> better<00:01:34.920> definition<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:36.000> get

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and i get better definition i get

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
and i get better definition i get
definition<00:01:36.930> obviously<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.829> using<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
definition obviously just using the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
definition obviously just using the
dimness<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.880> shingling<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.110> length

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
dimness with shingling to me the length

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
dimness with shingling to me the length
of<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.530> hair<00:01:40.680> determines<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.939> put

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
of your hair determines it to put

of your hair determines it to put
tippers<00:01:42.479> determines<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:43.710> dirty<00:01:44.399> your

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
tippers determines if you how dirty your

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
tippers determines if you how dirty your
hairs<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.210> clean<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> different<00:01:46.229> factors

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
hairs or clean all the different factors

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.600 
hairs or clean all the different factors
that's<00:01:46.649> white<00:01:46.799> natural<00:01:47.220> hair<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that's white natural hair is so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
that's white natural hair is so
unpredictable<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.619> bit

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
unpredictable like this is a little bit

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
unpredictable like this is a little bit
more<00:01:50.040> defined<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:51.060> over<00:01:51.390> here

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
more defined that i just got over here

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899 
more defined that i just got over here
so<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.530> has<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> white<00:01:53.009> film<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.520> need<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so it has the white film so you need to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.060 
so it has the white film so you need to
let<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> dry<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.079> you'll<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.740> able<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
let it dry and then you'll be able to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
let it dry and then you'll be able to
see<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.850> me<00:01:57.030> hopefully<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.960> just

see it but to me hopefully it's just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
see it but to me hopefully it's just
going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> elongate<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.250> hair<00:01:59.460> is

focusing<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:06.310> letting<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.459> kind<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.510> shrivel

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
focusing on letting it kind of shrivel

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.270 
focusing on letting it kind of shrivel
up<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.080> little<00:03:09.290> bit<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:09.650> texture<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.250> like

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
up a little bit and my texture is like

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.090 
up a little bit and my texture is like
the<00:03:10.970> loosest<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.079> back<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.799> see

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
the loosest in the back so you can see

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.449 
the loosest in the back so you can see
how<00:03:13.910> easily<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.780> defines<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.010> shingles<00:03:16.370> in

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
how easily it defines and shingles in

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.870 
how easily it defines and shingles in
the<00:03:16.549> back<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.209> front<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.459> see<00:03:19.610> it's

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the back but the front you can see it's

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.330 
the back but the front you can see it's
not<00:03:20.030> very<00:03:20.329> defined<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.799> just<00:03:22.010> put<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> little

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
not very defined but I just put a little

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.420 
not very defined but I just put a little
bit<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.549> water<00:03:22.790> on<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.530> then<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.560> put<00:03:25.280> my

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
bit of water on it and then just put my

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.080 
bit of water on it and then just put my
dim<00:03:26.000> ninh<00:03:26.180> through<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.630> let<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.810> release<00:03:27.230> I

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
dim ninh through and let it release I

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.190 
dim ninh through and let it release I
noticed<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.299> shingle<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.870> different

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
noticed you can shingle in different

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.710 
noticed you can shingle in different
ways<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.739> try<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> little<00:03:31.310> style<00:03:31.760> I'm
