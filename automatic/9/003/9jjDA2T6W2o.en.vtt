00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.080
 hello everyone and welcome to this series 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.790
 to tell them about how to build a 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.590
 pokemon team and several useful tips 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.860
 to achieve it training techniques 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.270
 terminology roles and more handsome than the 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.830
 most of the centers has put the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.630
 most of the coaches happened to them 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.360
 once in spite of having a good 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.890
 team most of the time they lost 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.200
 for sure many of you will 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.489
 will ask what makes a team be 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.290
 good are the guys are the roles 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.300
 what mistakes do I have so that my team does not 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.309
 be good most of these questions 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 you will find the answer in these videos 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 or at least that's my good intention a 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 once concluded the introduction 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 let's start 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.809
 once the introduction is finished 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.809
 let's start 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.090
 the first big question at the beginning 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.640
 to get a pokemon team is for 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.990
 than to use this equipment always before 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.030
 start a new team you have to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.729
 consider for what specific purpose what 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.320
 train you have put that depend on 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.750
 the movements and the pokemon that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.759
 will form for example if your team 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.200
 will serve to defeat a friend ted is 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.970
 build it specifically for 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.290
 counteract your team with 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.509
 movements that are super effective 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.070
 against theirs tougher touches 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.680
 to its attacks and items that put it in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 disadvantage but instead if your team 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.180
 is intended for competitive purposes 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.050
 you have to be prepared for everything 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.119
 attacks that cover all the weaknesses 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 possible because very resistant to everything 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.100
 a good strategy et cetera but if 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
 it's just a team to do it you can 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.850
 stay with your pokemon and movements 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.070
 favorites so it will be one more team of your 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.440
 I like it even if the success of it is not 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.289
 guaranteed what's important in a team 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.119
 is it balanced that the pokemon is 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.830
 complement each other by covering 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.009
 weaknesses and supporting disadvantages 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.810
 that's why a team is called the balance 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.810
 and the harmony of the team are everything 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.150
 an important part of the training of 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.540
 team is to know about the pokemon their 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.980
 stats your skills and movements 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.270
 know of these things you can put a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.520
 great advantage against an opponent 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.800
 giving you the ability to predict your 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.600
 strategy would be a good idea to use 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.310
 sites like brain dot net goes back to 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.980
 so good for the opportunity 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.510
 of the pros and cons of each pokemon to 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.280
 this height you can start to decide 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.230
 what pokemon can be part of your 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.160
 team would also be useful that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.950
 will investigate about the characteristics 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.140
 of each type knows a little bit of all the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.340
 pokemon is ideal to know more about 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.300
 Background is only necessary if you want 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.300
 train them dedicatedly 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.670
 good once the purpose of your 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.260
 team very clear and with some 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.750
 general knowledge about pokemon 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 we can begin to choose the types of 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.280
 pokemon that suits you to form it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.680
 the timing as it is called is crucial in 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.090
 the conflicting pokemon fights put 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.610
 that determine the attacks to which 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.110
 you will have access to the weaknesses 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.760
 resistances and even the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.739
 general characteristics of the pokemon 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.659
 A team of varied types is more 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.950
 convenient person means that the 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.140
 equipment of only one type can not 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.900
 work since if a single type 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.069
 share a common skill you can 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.629
 counteract with movements 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.610
 correct or with double-type pokemon 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.799
 but still my point of view very 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.299
 staff a team that contains several 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.010
 types of pokemon has better 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.079
 probabilities of prevailing but it is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.909
 completely at your choice is also 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.039
 convenient to choose types that have great 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.910
 amount of pokemon to have more 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.910
 place to choose 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.420
 okay that would be all for this video is 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.880
 short I know but it's because it's the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.980
 first where the basics are addressed but 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.810
 I still hope you liked it and 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.640
 that the little that I said is of some kind 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.640
 utility until the next video
