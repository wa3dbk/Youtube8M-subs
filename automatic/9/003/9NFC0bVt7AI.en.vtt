00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.870
 let's say orchid is considered tropical 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.910
 plant 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.780
 she grows on the village that is she 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 feeds on bark grow tree in order 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 to well good at home to grow it 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.190
 a plant is imperative when she 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 bloom you took plants from the store to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 example yes and you want her to grow 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 you have a smart need to wait 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 when it is from after each 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.990
 blooms changing ground under live with us 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 located in the market it also consists of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.239
 bark and there is still sphagnum moss 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.270
 when a little peat is added from peat 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 but very small quantities for 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 orchid pot must be sure 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 transparent why because root 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.370
 system since the plant grows on 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.490
 tree must see see ultraviolet 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.100
 that's what else 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.680
 also this is your after every bloom 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.150
 you need to change the soil and watering necessarily with 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 pallet why because root 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.600
 the system should drink so much water 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.880
 how much and you need well, that is, let's say 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 he gets water once a week 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.640
 for 1 hour you soak the plants 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 immerse the pot the third part 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.770
 pot in the water stood an hour all 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 pulled out and put it on a saucer 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 the same can be 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.370
 to the plant and the bedroom used such 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.920
 here's a pots here look here's a plan 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.170
 they are transparent as she is very 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
 decorate the plants themselves the same 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 you can pick plants by flower color 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.229
 moderately purple flower we take him 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.420
 planet or that cat she is very good 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420
 looks and harmonizes very well 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 so here also can be used for 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.340
 watering the plants here specifically in 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 the pot is made the podium will see one for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.259
 to have good ventilation 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.259
 the roots 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.150
 here's another story to tell 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.979
 plant bloomed you regularly means you 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.380
 the plant must be done to him 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.090
 shake that is periodically especially in 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.860
 autumn time it can be cooled 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 if possible, let him in his 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.480
 house to cool it down 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.480
 if not then bring to the balcony and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.300
 keep him but I suppose that was the 3 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.900
 temperature is 56 degrees then plant 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.640
 you will start again but bloom in order 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.120
 so that the shadows bloom well again and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.940
 grew 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.020
 you need to do not give him much 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 loose pots 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.209
 why because the free pot will be 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.459
 build up your root system and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.459
 leaves but will not give flowering 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.590
 even the flower still likes watering the top i 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.870
 I have for foliage 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.880
 You can also safely buy under the shower 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 why because in the tropics pass 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 big rain showers and the plant is very 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 feels good when he is poured 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.950
 water but it is priced on the flower itself 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.630
 when it blooms during the flowering water 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.750
 no pouring only pours on the elevator 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.780
 the root system of the plant itself 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:15.230
 unpretentious she is very good 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:19.220
 blooms constantly from 6 months to 9 and in 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.610
 care is very easy no matter how they require 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.610
 demanding care
