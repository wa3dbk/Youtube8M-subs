unintimidating it almost looks like a
green<00:01:12.630> turtle<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.260> something<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
green turtle or something like that and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.260 
green turtle or something like that and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
when you're using it and I find that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.450 
when you're using it and I find that
really<00:01:17.460> works<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:17.970> candid<00:01:18.750> shots<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
really works well for candid shots and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.800 
really works well for candid shots and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
sx-70 camera it's actually very similar
to<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> 600<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.540> terms<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> images<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to the 600 in terms of the images it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
to the 600 in terms of the images it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
creates except for two main things you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
creates except for two main things you
have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:27.810> control<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> because

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
have a lot more control with it because

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310

it's an SLR with manual focus and it can

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
it's an SLR with manual focus and it can
go<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:31.829> closer<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.729> focusing<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
go a lot closer in on your focusing and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.590 
go a lot closer in on your focusing and
also<00:01:34.229> kit<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> glass<00:01:34.950> lens<00:01:35.329> it's<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
also kit has a glass lens it's going to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
also kit has a glass lens it's going to
be<00:01:36.689> able<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.900> produce<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.229> sharper<00:01:37.680> image

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
be able to produce a lot sharper image

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
be able to produce a lot sharper image
so<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.939> discerning<00:01:39.240> photographer

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so for the more discerning photographer

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.090 
so for the more discerning photographer
this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> camera<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> want

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is the camera you're going to want

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
this is the camera you're going to want
to<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.360> camera<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.840> more

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to go with I like this camera a lot more

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.980 
to go with I like this camera a lot more
simply<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.310> SLR<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.630> more

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
simply because it is an SLR and for more

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
simply because it is an SLR and for more
serious<00:01:46.350> work<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.450> one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
serious work I can go to this the one

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.819 
serious work I can go to this the one
thing<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
thing I don't really like about it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.020 
thing I don't really like about it
though<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.670> through<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
though is when you look through the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.240 
though is when you look through the
viewfinder<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.649> hard<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> actually

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
viewfinder it's really hard to actually

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
viewfinder it's really hard to actually
see<00:01:53.610> straight<00:01:54.450> through<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.869> image<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.380> kind

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
see straight through the image it's kind

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
see straight through the image it's kind
of<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> telescope<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.640> eye<00:01:56.670> has

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of like a telescope where your eye has

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
of like a telescope where your eye has
to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.930> spot<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to be in just the right spot to see the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
to be in just the right spot to see the
image<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> little

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
image so that's kind of a little

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
image so that's kind of a little
cumbersome<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:01.500> you're<00:02:01.649> trying<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> work

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
cumbersome when you're trying to work

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
cumbersome when you're trying to work
fast<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> when<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> usually<00:02:03.659> grab<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
fast which is when I usually grab the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
fast which is when I usually grab the
600<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> notice<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> both<00:02:05.640> cameras

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
600 now you notice that both cameras

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.059 
600 now you notice that both cameras
either<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> black<00:02:06.750> flap<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> black<00:02:07.680> frog

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
either have a black flap or a black frog

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.619 
either have a black flap or a black frog
tone<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> comes<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> cover<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.390> film

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
tone that comes out to cover the film

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.639 
tone that comes out to cover the film
that's<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> film<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that's because the film is

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.619 
that's because the film is
light-sensitive<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.670> talked<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> impossible

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
light-sensitive I talked to impossible

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.940 
light-sensitive I talked to impossible
about<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.530> said<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
about this and they said that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
about this and they said that
actually<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.520> successfully<00:02:15.180> working<00:02:15.599> on<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
actually very successfully working on a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.270 
actually very successfully working on a
new<00:02:16.110> type<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.470> film<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.099> not

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
new type of film that is not

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.830 
new type of film that is not
light-sensitive<00:02:17.910> out<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.239> camera<00:02:18.629> I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
light-sensitive out of the camera I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.780 
light-sensitive out of the camera I
don't<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.379> when<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.739> coming<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.610> I

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
don't know when that's coming out but I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.309 
don't know when that's coming out but I
know<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.690> something<00:02:22.170> in

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
know that it's going to be something in

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.800 
know that it's going to be something in
the<00:02:22.410> near<00:02:22.620> future<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.420> excited

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the near future and I'm really excited

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
the near future and I'm really excited
to<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.200> more<00:02:25.739> about<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.519> closer<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.910> can

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
to know more about that the closer I can

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.479 
to know more about that the closer I can
get<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.629> way<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> was<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.440> better<00:02:28.620> as<00:02:29.430> far

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
get to the way it was the better as far

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.790 
get to the way it was the better as far
as<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> film<00:02:30.239> goes<00:02:30.480> by<00:02:31.230> Impossible<00:02:31.769> Project

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
as the film goes by Impossible Project

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520 
as the film goes by Impossible Project
it's<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.910> as<00:02:33.000> beautiful<00:02:33.569> as<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.110> Polaroid

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's just as beautiful as the Polaroid

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.620 
it's just as beautiful as the Polaroid
film<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.220> not<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.550> little<00:02:35.849> bit<00:02:36.000> more<00:02:36.239> varied

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
film and if not a little bit more varied

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.030 
film and if not a little bit more varied
because<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.080> provide<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.440> black<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.890> white

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
because they provide the black and white

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.550 
because they provide the black and white
as<00:02:38.250> well<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:39.959> watching<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.290> you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
as well and if you're watching this you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
as well and if you're watching this you
kind<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.830> know<00:02:40.980> already<00:02:41.280> why<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.730> want<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
kind of know already why you want to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
kind of know already why you want to
shoot<00:02:42.360> Polaroid<00:02:42.900> or<00:02:43.110> impossible<00:02:43.709> film

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
shoot Polaroid or impossible film

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.140 
shoot Polaroid or impossible film
because<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.340> want<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> recapture<00:02:44.940> that

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
because you want to recapture that

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.059 
because you want to recapture that
beautiful<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.709> when<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
beautiful look that you got when you

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.830 
beautiful look that you got when you
were<00:02:47.099> shooting<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.580> before<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.660> only

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
were shooting it before now the only

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.630 
were shooting it before now the only
real<00:02:49.019> conflict<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.799> with<00:02:49.980> Impossible

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
real conflict I see with Impossible

real conflict I see with Impossible

for<00:03:04.799> eight<00:03:05.160> shots<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.120> when<00:03:06.299> you're<00:03:06.420> pumping

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

out<00:03:07.019> these<00:03:07.200> pictures<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.950> little

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
out these pictures it's a little

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280 
out these pictures it's a little
disheartening<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.180> see<00:03:09.329> money<00:03:09.690> flying<00:03:10.049> out<00:03:10.260> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
disheartening to see money flying out of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.650 
disheartening to see money flying out of
the<00:03:10.410> camera<00:03:10.860> eventually<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.760> think<00:03:12.150> they're

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the camera eventually I think they're

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.789 
the camera eventually I think they're
going<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.959> able<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.140> lower<00:03:13.319> their<00:03:13.560> prices

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
going to be able to lower their prices

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.710 
going to be able to lower their prices
but<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.610> don't<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.150> when<00:03:15.329> that's<00:03:15.510> going<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
but I don't know when that's going to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.379 
but I don't know when that's going to
happen<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:16.680> until<00:03:17.610> they<00:03:17.760> either<00:03:17.910> develop

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
happen and so until they either develop

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.120 
happen and so until they either develop
a<00:03:18.480> more<00:03:18.630> professional<00:03:19.230> camera<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.769> use<00:03:19.920> with

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
a more professional camera to use with

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.069 
a more professional camera to use with
their<00:03:20.280> film<00:03:20.519> or<00:03:20.819> they<00:03:21.090> lower<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.480> cost<00:03:21.720> I

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
their film or they lower the cost I

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.530 
their film or they lower the cost I
think<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:23.670> going<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:24.030> kind<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.239> hard<00:03:24.359> for

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
think it's going to be kind of hard for

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.360 
think it's going to be kind of hard for
a<00:03:24.600> lot<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> people<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.170> justify<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.769> cost<00:03:26.100> of

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
a lot of people to justify the cost of

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.650 
a lot of people to justify the cost of
the<00:03:26.430> camera<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:27.389> only

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the camera so that's really my only

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.599 
the camera so that's really my only
gripe<00:03:27.840> though<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:28.680> does<00:03:28.829> sum<00:03:28.980> up<00:03:29.100> Impossible

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
gripe though so does sum up Impossible

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.550 
gripe though so does sum up Impossible
Project<00:03:29.639> has<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> lot<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.410> sounds

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
Project has a lot going on it sounds

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.809 
Project has a lot going on it sounds
like<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:31.889> keep<00:03:32.069> on<00:03:32.190> making<00:03:32.220> their<00:03:32.609> stuff

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
like they keep on making their stuff

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:33.740 
like they keep on making their stuff
better<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.420> better

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
better and better

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720 
better and better
it<00:03:34.319> really<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:34.739> ends<00:03:34.980> up<00:03:35.040> being<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.549> you

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
it really just ends up being up to you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.910 
it really just ends up being up to you
to<00:03:36.030> justify<00:03:36.510> whether<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.959> expense<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.650> worth

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
to justify whether the expense is worth

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.039 
to justify whether the expense is worth
the<00:03:38.069> images<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.670> want<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.940> create<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.540> me

the images you want to create for me

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.170 
the images you want to create for me
it's<00:03:40.290> worth<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.100> still<00:03:41.310> expensive<00:03:41.730> but

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
it's worth it it's still expensive but

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.970 
it's worth it it's still expensive but
I'm<00:03:42.630> willing<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:42.989> put<00:03:43.200> up<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.410> cost<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.859> create

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
I'm willing to put up the cost to create

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.949 
I'm willing to put up the cost to create
