00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.290
 technology alan and ricardo good night 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.240
 good architects good night in your 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.849
 dinner for all the fans of the video 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.130
 photography and radio control this 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.660
 segment is special for you speak 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.550
 we are going to use droids today 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.160
 like that of forbidden films or 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.449
 you mean drones actually that's why 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.119
 the engineer is with us today 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.769
 luis cantú and salvador gonzalez lg 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.269
 electronics to talk a little 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.429
 about this new trend 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.900
 louis that you can practice to us that is a 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.020
 drone when I think of a drone 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.720
 comes terminator or wally or the robots 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.060
 which is a drone saler as it watches a drone 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.310
 basically it's a set is a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.380
 motorized vehicle with several engines 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.680
 that can be raised to great distances 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.610
 or that this is I imagine that they are not 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.220
 only toys like that has 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.830
 intelligence is correct has a 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.740
 logic card that can be programmed 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.420
 for several for various uses within the 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.130
 toy industry etc not but good 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.750
 if you had to define what it is that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.460
 makes them completely different from a 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.040
 toy to this that is special to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.019
 video photo since I had to talk like that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.549
 as 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.619
 Well, the great stability that 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.450
 have or what is technology can be 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.299
 handle by gps by positioning 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.960
 inside a coordinate tablet 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.520
 etc 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560
 now he told us that they have something very 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.229
 interesting that they are flying they have 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.420
 a kilometer and a half or so of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.789
 reach in the radio and then if they go out 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920
 or it goes the good signal has a function 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.719
 special that the signal is reached it 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.689
 they return directly to your location 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.179
 where they went on and for example good 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.979
 I as a user so I would use a drone 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.439
 we already know that they are not toys are 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.119
 tools for what they serve well 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.649
 has many uses one of them is for 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.110
 aerial photography of video and other for 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.420
 security and to have fun 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.729
 mainly also within those that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.619
 there are quite a lot more ok that we 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.380
 it seems if we are going to see a little bit of a 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.240
 drone in action 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.710
 we are ready to fly you have seen me 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.710
 go ahead if you can please 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.119
 and good to the confusion that had moments 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.679
 because the star wars characters 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.679
 they have the similar name 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.550
 there goes perfect 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.890
 it's really amazing all the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.770
 technology that can integrate these 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 small devices that we by 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.440
 example the weekend we went to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.900
 foundry to make some shots there 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.450
 we have the videos on the website and the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.360
 they are very parents there are no architect 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.890
 UFO plane if they wanted to watch the videos 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.270
 are available on our page 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.830
 Youtube 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.120
 And that is going to landing the box 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.850
 builder and with this you can take 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.850
 videos or photos or all of them 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.530
 ok in fact to your dinner we bring a video 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.510
 also above the cabin 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.590
 we do not have it yet it's ready 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.150
 for the video I 'm not the same but I do not know 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.380
 worry because the video will also be 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.000
 available on the facebook page of 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.860
