00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
genesis of this machine was we got tired

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
genesis of this machine was we got tired

of shaking a bucket - pacifier material

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.690 
of shaking a bucket - pacifier material
we<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.960> found<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.320> early<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we know we found out early on that to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600 
we know we found out early on that to
get<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.719> fine<00:00:33.989> gold<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.399> classify

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
get the fine gold you have to classify

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
get the fine gold you have to classify
it<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.870> particle<00:00:37.260> size

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it you have to get your particle size

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
it you have to get your particle size
down<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> size<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> material<00:00:38.790> trying

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
down to the size of the material trying

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
down to the size of the material trying
to<00:00:39.360> separate<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.800> came<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to separate it from so we came up with a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
to separate it from so we came up with a
classifier<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.090> does<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.780> us<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.379> got

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
classifier that does that for us we got

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.290 
classifier that does that for us we got
tired<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.980> getting<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.700> shaking<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
tired of getting up and down shaking the

tired of getting up and down shaking the
bucket<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.289> shaking<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> bucket

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
bucket back down shaking the bucket

shoveling<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:49.020> stand

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
shoveling some more in now we can stand

and<00:00:49.649> shovel<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.340> into<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> machine<00:00:52.879> well

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and shovel right into the machine well

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
and shovel right into the machine well
we've<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:54.690> main<00:00:54.899> sizes<00:00:55.379> we've<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.890> the

it to your 12-volt battery turn it on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.640 
it to your 12-volt battery turn it on
and<00:01:05.189> start<00:01:05.280> separating<00:01:05.640> rocks<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.360> dirt<00:01:06.689> we

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and start separating rocks from dirt we

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
and start separating rocks from dirt we
also<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> model<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.549> has<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> water<00:01:09.570> kit

all of the accessories of the earthquake

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
all of the accessories of the earthquake
can<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.450> added<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> any<00:01:19.110> machine<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.890> bake

can be added to any machine that we bake

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
can be added to any machine that we bake
so<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.450> plug<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.990> double<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.799> screws

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
so they just plug in double the screws

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
so they just plug in double the screws
turns<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:24.350> switches<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.770> right

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
turns it on switches back here right

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
turns it on switches back here right
we've<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> battery<00:01:26.850> we've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> control

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
have any material to show you right now

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.830 
have any material to show you right now
family<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.880> sell<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.360> material<00:01:42.750> in

family but you can sell your material in
at<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.050> point<00:01:43.380> turn<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.160> vibrator<00:01:44.550> on

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
at this point turn the vibrator on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.230 
at this point turn the vibrator on
alcohol<00:01:47.120> it<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> variable<00:01:48.810> speed<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:51.060> tell

alcohol it is a variable speed you tell

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
alcohol it is a variable speed you tell
it<00:01:51.360> makes<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> racket<00:01:52.170> especially<00:01:52.590> with

it makes a bit of racket especially with
no<00:01:52.920> material<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.580> there<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.630> vibration

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
no material in there so the vibration

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.810 
no material in there so the vibration
and<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.680> combinations<00:01:56.280> vibration<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.760> the

and the combinations vibration in the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.040 
and the combinations vibration in the
water<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.150> what<00:01:57.300> separates<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.960> you're

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
water is what separates it if you're

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.230 
water is what separates it if you're
running<00:01:58.170> dry<00:01:58.440> material<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.310> vibration<00:01:59.880> beats

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
running dry material the vibration beats

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.750 
running dry material the vibration beats
the<00:02:00.420> dry<00:02:00.570> material<00:02:00.720> off<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.650> rocks<00:02:02.100> which

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
the dry material off off the rocks which

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.250 
the dry material off off the rocks which
allows<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.180> free<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:03.720> gold<00:02:04.020> that's

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
allows you to free up more gold that's
