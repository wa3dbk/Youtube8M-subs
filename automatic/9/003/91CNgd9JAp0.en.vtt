faking it some watercress in there and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
faking it some watercress in there and
this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> coming<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> big<00:01:09.840> bio<00:01:10.110> filter

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this is coming from that big bio filter

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
this is coming from that big bio filter
into<00:01:10.830> another<00:01:11.220> tank<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> hope<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> puts

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
into another tank that I hope to puts

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
into another tank that I hope to puts
their<00:01:13.229> death<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.590> did<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
their death we did this would be the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
their death we did this would be the
duckweed<00:01:14.700> tank<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.990> overflowing

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
duckweed tank and then it's overflowing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
duckweed tank and then it's overflowing
back<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.689> big<00:01:19.110> IDC<00:01:19.590> chart<00:01:20.240> the

back down into the big IDC chart the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.620 
back down into the big IDC chart the
other<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.140> smaller<00:01:22.409> filter<00:01:23.299> comes<00:01:24.299> down

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
other one the smaller filter comes down

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.160 
other one the smaller filter comes down
and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.780> two

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and then it goes into these two

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.999 
and then it goes into these two

temperature needed you know already

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
temperature needed you know already
proved<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.549> too<00:01:56.790> warm<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> summer

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
proved that it's too warm for the summer

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.679 
proved that it's too warm for the summer
months<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> hold<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.100> yellow<00:01:59.369> perch<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.880> bass

months to hold like yellow perch or bass

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
months to hold like yellow perch or bass
and<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.500> warm<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> wintertime

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and it's just too warm in the wintertime

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
and it's just too warm in the wintertime
but<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> summer<00:02:03.509> temps<00:02:03.869> should<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.350> fine

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
but the summer temps should be just fine

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.920 
but the summer temps should be just fine

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
here comes down and it splits just like

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.059 
here comes down and it splits just like
a<00:03:34.450> swirl<00:03:34.780> filter<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.319> know<00:03:35.440> cut<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.799> comes

down has a pipe going runway to pipe in
it<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.829> swirls<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> water<00:03:39.519> what<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:40.810> does

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
it and swirls the water what this does

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.460 
it and swirls the water what this does
is<00:03:41.410> slow<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.430> water<00:03:42.989> circulating<00:03:43.989> before<00:03:44.410> it

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
is slow the water circulating before it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.490 
is slow the water circulating before it
comes<00:03:44.620> back<00:03:44.859> into<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.250> overflow<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:47.380> know

comes back into the overflow you know
it's<00:03:47.680> called<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:48.010> radial<00:03:48.400> flow<00:03:48.430> filter<00:03:48.790> but

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
it's called a radial flow filter but

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.240 
it's called a radial flow filter but
I've<00:03:49.750> also<00:03:49.930> incorporated<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> swirl<00:03:51.040> filter

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
I've also incorporated the swirl filter

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.770 
I've also incorporated the swirl filter
and<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:51.639> can<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> debris<00:03:52.299> coming<00:03:52.600> in

you know I use piece of plastic to kind

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.030 
you know I use piece of plastic to kind
of<00:03:58.840> hold<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.380> there<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.709> also

of hold that in there and that also
helps<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:01.329> know<00:04:01.480> slow<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.019> water<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.440> little

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
helps you know slow the water a little

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.940 
helps you know slow the water a little
bit<00:04:02.829> and<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.790> basket<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:04.720> catches<00:04:05.290> leaves

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.189 
making another one similar to this with
my<00:04:15.250> extra<00:04:15.639> bottle

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
my extra bottle

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.309 
my extra bottle
and<00:04:17.919> I'm<00:04:18.069> filling<00:04:18.639> this<00:04:18.759> up<00:04:18.819> with<00:04:19.299> caps<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:20.319 
and I'm filling this up with caps and

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.309 
and I'm filling this up with caps and
it'll<00:04:20.590> be<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:21.009> heavy-duty<00:04:21.459> bio<00:04:21.850> filter<00:04:22.479> you

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:23.319 
it'll be a heavy-duty bio filter you

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.559 
it'll be a heavy-duty bio filter you
know<00:04:23.440> sitting<00:04:23.949> sitting<00:04:24.639> where<00:04:24.970> this<00:04:25.240> one<00:04:25.419> is

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
know sitting sitting where this one is

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.900 
know sitting sitting where this one is
just<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.870> secondary<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:27.190> help<00:04:27.400> catch<00:04:27.639> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
just like a secondary to help catch the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.800 
just like a secondary to help catch the
stuff<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.960> gets<00:04:29.349> through<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.710> one<00:04:33.810> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
stuff that gets through this one and
