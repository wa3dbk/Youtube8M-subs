why<00:01:49.479> are<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.630> raise<00:01:49.840> difference<00:01:50.380> being<00:01:50.530> up

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
why are you raise difference being up

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.030 
why are you raise difference being up

that<00:02:00.300> they<00:02:00.510> could<00:02:01.070> possibly<00:02:02.070> possibly<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:03.090> us

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that they could possibly possibly see us

from this corner here they really wanted
to<00:02:05.400> try<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:05.880> find<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.240> or<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.050> corn<00:02:07.290> here

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470

obviously<00:02:07.770> air<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.490> find<00:02:08.729> us<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.050> hid<00:02:10.229> here

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
obviously air to find us so we hid here

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.690

okay okay hey guys where you send this

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.290 
okay okay hey guys where you send this
roadblock<00:04:41.800> or<00:04:42.130> ER<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
roadblock or ER and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.850 
roadblock or ER and
observer<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.889> close<00:04:46.190> finding<00:04:46.699> this

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.159 

it<00:04:48.979> didn't<00:04:49.639> didn't<00:04:50.389> take<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.629> time<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:51.020> he

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
it didn't didn't take the time to he

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.600 
it didn't didn't take the time to he
didn't<00:04:51.439> didn't<00:04:51.650> even<00:04:51.770> ask<00:04:51.889> he<00:04:52.250> didn't<00:04:52.490> say

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610

didn't didn't even ask he didn't say
anything<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.969> saw<00:04:53.330> where<00:04:53.629> he<00:04:53.659> got<00:04:53.990> left<00:04:54.439> again

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
anything I saw where he got left again

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.810 
anything I saw where he got left again
he<00:04:55.159> decided<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.669> was<00:04:55.789> not<00:04:55.909> worth<00:04:56.060> it

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
he decided it was not worth it

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.750 
he decided it was not worth it
he<00:04:57.000> checked<00:04:57.750> all<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.930> bases<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.740> only<00:04:59.550> thought

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
he checked all the bases I only thought

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.000 
he checked all the bases I only thought
we<00:04:59.910> had<00:05:00.750> disconnected<00:05:01.170> senses<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:01.830> know<00:05:01.920> his

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
we had disconnected senses you know his

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.840 
we had disconnected senses you know his

technique ya know we told you about one

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.450 
technique ya know we told you about one
hour<00:05:21.120> ago<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.960> our<00:05:22.110> how<00:05:22.560> ago<00:05:22.830> we<00:05:23.010> posted<00:05:23.190> the

hour ago and our how ago we posted the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.390 
hour ago and our how ago we posted the
last<00:05:23.700> video<00:05:23.970> which<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.570> 1v1<00:05:24.990> win<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.920> we

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
last video which is the 1v1 win and we

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.120 
last video which is the 1v1 win and we
said<00:05:26.640> Oh<00:05:26.820> we'll<00:05:26.850> probably<00:05:27.300> have<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:28.010> two<00:05:29.010> of

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
said Oh we'll probably have the two of

said Oh we'll probably have the two of
you<00:05:29.190> too<00:05:29.370> whenever<00:05:29.670> we<00:05:29.970> get<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.510> probably

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
you too whenever we get it it's probably

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.000 
you too whenever we get it it's probably
not<00:05:30.870> going<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.020> come<00:05:31.170> on<00:05:31.260> upper<00:05:31.500> strike<00:05:31.740> what

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
not going to come on upper strike what

about an hour later now we've got it so

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.620 
about an hour later now we've got it so
boom<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.260> don't<00:05:34.530> give<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.920> promise<00:05:35.630> 3v3
