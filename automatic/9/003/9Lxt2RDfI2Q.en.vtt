00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
there's nothing like having a wash and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.820 
there's nothing like having a wash and
go<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.119> looks<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.420> triangle<00:01:41.830> and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.170 
go and it looks like a triangle and
that's<00:01:42.920> that's<00:01:43.430> pretty<00:01:43.520> much<00:01:43.759> what<00:01:43.939> I've<00:01:44.030> had

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
