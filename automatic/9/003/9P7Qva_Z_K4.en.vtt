it's<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.809> something<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.500> guess<00:00:34.680> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's not something I guess it's

it's not something I guess it's
necessarily<00:00:35.489> surprising<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
necessarily surprising I think it's a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.799 
necessarily surprising I think it's a
good<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.270> what

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
good time to take a look back at what

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.680 
good time to take a look back at what
the<00:00:39.989> legacy<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.460> Lance<00:00:41.969> Armstrong

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the legacy is now of Lance Armstrong

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
the legacy is now of Lance Armstrong
because<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.290> certainly<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> sport<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because it's certainly not a sport and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.229 
because it's certainly not a sport and
cycling<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:46.110> gets<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.039> ton<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> publicity<00:00:47.579> and

Lance Armstrong for quite a while put it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
Lance Armstrong for quite a while put it
on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> map<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.899> only<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.559> his<00:00:52.710> store

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
on the map not only because of his store

on the map not only because of his store
we<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> he<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> five

percent chance to live and he battled

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.170 
percent chance to live and he battled
back<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.660> testicular<00:00:58.140> cancer<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.520> part<00:00:59.969> in

it in and of itself than that that's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
it in and of itself than that that's
incredible<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.680> display<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
incredible but then to just display the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
incredible but then to just display the
pure<00:01:05.760> dominance<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.720> Lance<00:01:06.930> Armstrong<00:01:07.530> had

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
pure dominance that Lance Armstrong had

winning seven straight Tour de France's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
winning seven straight Tour de France's
coming<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> few<00:01:11.610> years<00:01:11.670> after<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
coming back a few years after the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.890 
coming back a few years after the
retirement<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.320> finishing<00:01:14.010> second<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.580> third

he<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> greatest<00:01:17.490> cyclist<00:01:18.090> ever

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
he really is the greatest cyclist ever

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.950 
he really is the greatest cyclist ever
that<00:01:18.990> being<00:01:19.320> said<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.040> comes<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
that being said I think it comes down to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
that being said I think it comes down to
now<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> he's<00:01:22.290> admitted<00:01:22.740> doping<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.670> be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
now that he's admitted doping and to be

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
now that he's admitted doping and to be
realistic<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
realistic about this i don't think that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.539 
realistic about this i don't think that
it<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.840> anything<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.110> surprised<00:01:28.890> anyone<00:01:29.490> i

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it is anything that surprised anyone i

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
it is anything that surprised anyone i
think<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> were<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> realistic<00:01:31.200> fan<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
think if you were a realistic fan and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
think if you were a realistic fan and
whether<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.130> Fanta<00:01:32.549> Lance<00:01:32.729> Armstrong<00:01:33.299> were

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
whether your Fanta Lance Armstrong were

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.850 
whether your Fanta Lance Armstrong were
just<00:01:33.630> an<00:01:33.720> observer<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.740> much

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
just an observer which is pretty much

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.210 
just an observer which is pretty much
where<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.960> had<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> pretty<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:37.950> idea

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
where I was you had a pretty good idea

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
where I was you had a pretty good idea
with<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> reports<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.630> came<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.170> that

Lance Armstrong had done something that

Lance Armstrong had done something that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
was cheating you didn't know exactly

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
was cheating you didn't know exactly
what<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.170> might<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.649> ever<00:01:46.950> know

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
what it was we might not ever know

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.960 
what it was we might not ever know
exactly<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.240> Lance<00:01:48.479> Armstrong<00:01:49.079> did<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.820> we

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
exactly what Lance Armstrong did but we

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.999

all<00:03:51.959> these<00:03:52.109> titles<00:03:52.590> he's<00:03:52.950> getting<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.340> lifetime

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819

relief after denying it for so many
years<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.980> me<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> legacy<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:16.940> Lance

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
years to me the legacy of Lance

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.940 
years to me the legacy of Lance
Armstrong<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.020> that<00:04:18.170> this<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.500> something<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
Armstrong and that this is something a

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.720 
Armstrong and that this is something a
lot<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.160> people<00:04:19.280> ask<00:04:19.760> me<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:21.580> when<00:04:22.580> it's

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
lot of people ask me is when it's

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.780 
lot of people ask me is when it's
Armstrong<00:04:23.210> was<00:04:23.420> an<00:04:23.570> inspiration<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:25.460> said

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
Armstrong was an inspiration and I said

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.060 
Armstrong was an inspiration and I said
I<00:04:26.210> still<00:04:26.540> hear<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.900> lot<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.380> people<00:04:27.530> say<00:04:27.860> that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
I still hear a lot of people say that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.340 
I still hear a lot of people say that
regardless<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.450> not<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.900> same<00:04:30.140> as

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
regardless of this it's not the same as

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.100 
regardless of this it's not the same as
Barry<00:04:30.620> Bonds<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.310> Mark<00:04:31.850> McGwire<00:04:32.110> using

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire using

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.260 
Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire using
steroids<00:04:33.410> it's<00:04:33.680> not<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.010> same<00:04:34.220> thing<00:04:34.270> because

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
steroids it's not the same thing because

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.600 
steroids it's not the same thing because
he<00:04:35.870> was<00:04:36.050> an<00:04:36.170> inspiration<00:04:36.440> not<00:04:37.040> only<00:04:37.100> because

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
he was an inspiration not only because

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.730 
he was an inspiration not only because
of<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:37.760> dominance<00:04:38.390> like<00:04:38.570> those<00:04:38.810> too<00:04:39.110> but<00:04:39.350> he

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
of the dominance like those too but he

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.090 
of the dominance like those too but he
was<00:04:39.890> an<00:04:40.010> inspiration<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.830> fact

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
was an inspiration because of the fact

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.880 
was an inspiration because of the fact
that<00:04:43.280> he<00:04:43.460> battled<00:04:43.850> back<00:04:44.300> from<00:04:44.540> such<00:04:44.840> odds<00:04:45.140> and

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
that he battled back from such odds and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.380 
that he battled back from such odds and
it<00:04:46.010> didn't<00:04:46.280> even<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.700> be<00:04:46.820> cancer<00:04:47.270> the

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
it didn't even have to be cancer the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.300 
it didn't even have to be cancer the
fact<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.720> his<00:04:47.960> cancer<00:04:48.200> is<00:04:48.560> something<00:04:49.190> that

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
fact that his cancer is something that

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.310

it's<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.910> was<00:05:02.060> an<00:05:02.180> incredible<00:05:02.720> feat<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.170> really

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
it's it was an incredible feat it really

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.400 
it's it was an incredible feat it really
was<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.980> I<00:05:04.250> can't<00:05:04.880> tell<00:05:05.120> anyone<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.540> says

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
was and I can't tell anyone that says

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.800 
was and I can't tell anyone that says
that<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.820> really<00:05:07.820> still<00:05:08.180> think<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.540> Lance

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
that I really still think that Lance

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.540 
that I really still think that Lance
Armstrong's<00:05:09.380> an<00:05:09.500> inspiration<00:05:10.040> because<00:05:10.190> of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
Armstrong's an inspiration because of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.600 
Armstrong's an inspiration because of
his<00:05:10.730> working<00:05:11.570> sup<00:05:12.050> with<00:05:12.470> coming<00:05:13.280> back<00:05:13.430> from

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
his working sup with coming back from

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.670 
his working sup with coming back from
cancer<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.330> all<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.930> money<00:05:15.140> he's<00:05:15.410> made

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
cancer and all the money he's made

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.800 
cancer and all the money he's made
giving<00:05:15.920> back<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.520> cancer<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.150> can't<00:05:17.630> tell

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
giving back to cancer I can't tell

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.870 
giving back to cancer I can't tell
anyone<00:05:17.990> that<00:05:18.170> he's<00:05:18.590> not<00:05:18.800> an<00:05:18.980> inspiration<00:05:19.730> I

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
anyone that he's not an inspiration I

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.500 
anyone that he's not an inspiration I
can<00:05:20.180> say<00:05:20.480> that<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:21.640> if<00:05:22.640> you<00:05:22.970> only<00:05:23.120> care<00:05:23.480> about

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
can say that for if you only care about

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.780 
can say that for if you only care about
him<00:05:23.900> because<00:05:24.200> of<00:05:24.230> his<00:05:24.350> athletic<00:05:24.560> ability<00:05:25.400> then

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
him because of his athletic ability then

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.220 
him because of his athletic ability then
maybe<00:05:26.150> that's<00:05:26.450> something<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.960> need<00:05:26.990> to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
maybe that's something you need to

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.260 
maybe that's something you need to
rethink<00:05:27.410> because<00:05:27.950> at<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.220> point<00:05:28.340> we<00:05:29.000> find

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
rethink because at this point we find

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.620 
rethink because at this point we find
out<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.540> his<00:05:29.810> athletic<00:05:30.380> ability<00:05:30.860> was

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
out that his athletic ability was

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.180 
out that his athletic ability was
unnaturally<00:05:32.630> enhanced<00:05:33.170> and<00:05:33.350> in<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.860> end<00:05:34.040> it

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
unnaturally enhanced and in the end it

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.370 
unnaturally enhanced and in the end it
comes<00:05:34.400> down<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:35.030> what<00:05:35.600> is<00:05:35.750> your<00:05:35.780> take<00:05:36.200> on

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
comes down to what is your take on

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.950 
comes down to what is your take on
steroids<00:05:36.980> for<00:05:37.160> me<00:05:37.370> I'm<00:05:38.300> not<00:05:38.510> saying<00:05:38.810> that

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
steroids for me I'm not saying that

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.750 
steroids for me I'm not saying that
Lance<00:05:39.230> Armstrong<00:05:39.740> didn't<00:05:40.010> work<00:05:40.130> hard<00:05:40.520> as<00:05:40.730> hell

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
Lance Armstrong didn't work hard as hell

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.570 
Lance Armstrong didn't work hard as hell
because<00:05:41.180> you<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.930> don't<00:05:42.200> just<00:05:42.380> show<00:05:42.680> up<00:05:42.710> take
