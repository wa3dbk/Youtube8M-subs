it's<00:01:33.840> part<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.040> exercises<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.210> some

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's part of the exercises see some

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's part of the exercises see some
people<00:01:36.690> wouldn't<00:01:37.140> realize<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.979> once<00:01:38.280> you've

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
people wouldn't realize that once you've

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
people wouldn't realize that once you've
started<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.080> see<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
started that's it you have to see it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
started that's it you have to see it
through<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.190> it's<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.580> wind

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
through so it's all about wind

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.180 
through so it's all about wind
management<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> show<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
management can you show me how you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.520 
management can you show me how you
actually<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.420> computer<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.080> see<00:01:46.229> wind

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
actually get the computer and see wind

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.670 
actually get the computer and see wind
limits<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> sort<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.700> thing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
limits and all that sort of thing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.880 
limits and all that sort of thing
we<00:01:50.680> can<00:01:50.890> add<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.630> great<00:01:52.630> file<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.469> shows<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
we can add a great file it shows the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.480 
we can add a great file it shows the
weather<00:01:54.100> on<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:55.060> situation<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:56.380> can<00:01:56.490> really

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
weather on this situation we can really

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.020 
weather on this situation we can really
see<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.320> low<00:01:59.590> pressure<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.820> if

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
see that this is a low pressure and if

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.539 
see that this is a low pressure and if
the<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.930> course<00:02:02.380> goes<00:02:02.619> through<00:02:03.039> here<00:02:03.340> and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
the if the course goes through here and

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.600 
the if the course goes through here and
we<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.970> go<00:02:04.149> there<00:02:04.360> we<00:02:04.509> have<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.780> manage

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
we have to go there we have to manage

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.719 
we have to go there we have to manage
words<00:02:07.470> degree<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.679> were<00:02:08.860> doing<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.220> what

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
words degree if you were doing that what

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.970 
words degree if you were doing that what
would<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.970> worst<00:02:10.209> part<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.810> be<00:02:10.989> if<00:02:11.739> it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
would the worst part of that be if it's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.530 
would the worst part of that be if it's
yellow<00:02:12.250> or<00:02:12.610> red<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.420> pink<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.980> very<00:02:15.489> bad<00:02:15.790> okay

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
yellow or red or pink it's very bad okay

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.320 
yellow or red or pink it's very bad okay
