of<00:01:48.270> becoming<00:01:48.509> immune<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.189> since<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of becoming immune to this so since I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
of becoming immune to this so since I
have<00:01:51.090> film<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.570> still<00:01:51.810> gonna<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.530> but

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have film I'm still gonna use this but

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
have film I'm still gonna use this but
since<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.850> love<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.390> much<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.840> half

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
since I love this so much and it's half

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
since I love this so much and it's half
the<00:01:55.049> price<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.219> use<00:01:56.729> these

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the price I'm gonna you know use these

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.600 
the price I'm gonna you know use these
interchangeable<00:01:57.750> wing<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.049> guess<00:01:58.399> maybe<00:01:59.399> use

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
interchangeable wing I guess maybe use

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
interchangeable wing I guess maybe use
this<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.060> day<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> next<00:02:00.810> day

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
this one one day this one the next day

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
this one one day this one the next day
or<00:02:01.259> use<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.369> use<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
or use this one up and then use this one

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.359 
or use this one up and then use this one
up<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.200> almost<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.159> guess

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
up this one is almost up so I guess

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.620 
up this one is almost up so I guess
that's<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.790> reason<00:02:05.969> why<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> went<00:02:06.420> ahead<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that's one reason why I went ahead and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.949 
that's one reason why I went ahead and
bought<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.940> love<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.569> feel

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
bought this but I just love it I feel

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.770 
bought this but I just love it I feel
like<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.229> makes<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.760> well<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.540> it's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
like it makes my well for one thing it's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.460 
like it makes my well for one thing it's
like<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.020> said

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
like I said

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.960 
like I said
felt<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.830> was<00:02:13.860> getting<00:02:14.010> immune<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.940> I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
felt like I was getting immune to this I

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
felt like I was getting immune to this I
felt<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.630> my<00:02:15.780> foundation<00:02:16.410> wasn't<00:02:16.770> lasting

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
felt like my foundation wasn't lasting

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520 
felt like my foundation wasn't lasting
all<00:02:17.460> day<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.970> had<00:02:18.210> been<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:19.320> now<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
all day like it had been so now that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
all day like it had been so now that
I've<00:02:19.770> switched<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> elf<00:02:20.670> mineral<00:02:21.660> face

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
I've switched to the elf mineral face

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.260 
I've switched to the elf mineral face
primer<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.740> feel<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.220> my<00:02:23.370> foundation<00:02:23.910> lasts

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
primer I feel like my foundation lasts

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
primer I feel like my foundation lasts
like<00:02:24.330> getting<00:02:24.600> used<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> maybe<00:02:25.680> my<00:02:25.800> face<00:02:26.100> isn't

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
like getting used to maybe my face isn't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.670 
like getting used to maybe my face isn't
as<00:02:26.760> used<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.390> well<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> know<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.380> used<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
as used to well I know it's not used to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.250 
as used to well I know it's not used to
this<00:02:28.830> primer<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.340> maybe<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.730> why<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.300> don't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this primer so maybe that's why I don't

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.380 
this primer so maybe that's why I don't
know<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.460> makes<00:02:32.640> any<00:02:32.820> sense<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.360> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
know if that makes any sense like you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.210 
know if that makes any sense like you
know<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:33.870> immune<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.500> medicine<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
know how you get immune to medicine I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.100 
know how you get immune to medicine I
don't<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.180> you're<00:02:36.300> facing<00:02:36.480> immune<00:02:36.930> to

don't know if you're facing immune to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.320 
don't know if you're facing immune to
products<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.970> anyways<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.520> yeah<00:02:41.730> this

products but like anyways so yeah this
is<00:02:42.390> half<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.960> price<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.890> comes<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.400> pump

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
is half the price this comes in a pump

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460 
is half the price this comes in a pump
which<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.060> convenient<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.200> haven't

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
which is convenient but I haven't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.110 
which is convenient but I haven't
started<00:02:46.890> running<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.520> products<00:02:47.970> yet

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
started running out of the products yet

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880 
started running out of the products yet
so<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> don't<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:49.260> that'll<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so I don't know if that'll be like a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.670 
so I don't know if that'll be like a
pain<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.550> butt<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.500> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
pain in the butt but I really like it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.510 
pain in the butt but I really like it
and<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.750> their<00:02:55.740> studio<00:02:56.190> one

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
and it just so like their studio one

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.670 
and it just so like their studio one
really<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.480> fashionable<00:02:58.140> packaging

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
really is like so fashionable packaging

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.340 
really is like so fashionable packaging
I<00:02:58.830> really<00:02:59.100> like<00:02:59.220> their<00:02:59.370> packaging<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.840> used

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
I really like their packaging but I used

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.690 
I really like their packaging but I used
this<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.570> elf<00:03:04.700> finishing

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
this and then I use a the elf finishing

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.430 
this and then I use a the elf finishing
powder<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.210> why<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.020> check<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.320> out

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
powder that's why you can check that out

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.530 
powder that's why you can check that out
in<00:03:07.560> my<00:03:07.650> foundation<00:03:08.130> routine<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.150> feel<00:03:09.510> like

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
in my foundation routine so I feel like

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
in my foundation routine so I feel like
these<00:03:09.780> two<00:03:09.840> probably<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.680> work<00:03:10.980> together

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
these two probably do work together

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.610 
these two probably do work together
better<00:03:12.210> than<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:15.210> powder<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
better than the the powder with the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
better than the the powder with the
Plautius<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.239> am<00:03:18.330> starting<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
Plautius but I really am starting to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.750 
Plautius but I really am starting to
dislike<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.320> powder<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.489> want<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
dislike that powder and if you want to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
dislike that powder and if you want to
