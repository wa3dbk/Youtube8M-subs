00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
because like I said that toe area there

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.070 
because like I said that toe area there
that's<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.490> light<00:02:36.790> suede<00:02:37.270> color<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.870> can

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that's a light suede color and that can

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.680 
that's a light suede color and that can
get<00:02:38.230> dirty<00:02:38.290> very<00:02:38.950> easily<00:02:39.300> they<00:02:40.300> do<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.660> some

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
get dirty very easily they do got some

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.930 
get dirty very easily they do got some
you<00:02:41.560> know<00:02:41.590> formulas<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.460> stuff<00:02:42.520> out<00:02:42.790> there

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
you know formulas and stuff out there

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.640 
you know formulas and stuff out there
that<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.240> can<00:02:43.390> use<00:02:43.630> probably<00:02:44.170> wants<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.500> get

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that you can use probably wants to get

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.110 
that you can use probably wants to get
dirty<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.010> kind<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> bring<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> back<00:02:45.850> but

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
dirty to kind of bring it back but

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.050 
dirty to kind of bring it back but
overall<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.959> think<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> spot<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
overall I think that is a spot that you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.640 
overall I think that is a spot that you
want<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.270> be<00:02:49.360> careful<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.840> not<00:02:50.080> getting<00:02:50.350> dirty

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
at all because who knows whether it will

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.870 
at all because who knows whether it will
come<00:02:52.690> back<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.200> clean<00:02:53.770> as<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.670> its
