00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
so that the braids are canto divide the

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.709 
so that the braids are canto divide the
section<00:04:02.620> into<00:04:02.950> equal<00:04:03.340> parts<00:04:03.549> making<00:04:04.540> sure

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:04.719 
section into equal parts making sure

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.720 
section into equal parts making sure
that<00:04:04.900> each<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.109> them<00:04:05.409> contains<00:04:05.859> one<00:04:06.129> grade<00:04:06.459> and

that each of them contains one grade and

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.759 
that each of them contains one grade and
then<00:04:07.329> I<00:04:07.420> simply<00:04:07.599> bring<00:04:07.959> these<00:04:08.139> two<00:04:08.319> parts

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
then I simply bring these two parts

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.640 
then I simply bring these two parts
under<00:04:09.310> my<00:04:09.489> bottom<00:04:09.819> strand<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.510> secure<00:04:11.439> them

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
under my bottom strand and secure them

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.979 
under my bottom strand and secure them
together

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.590 

I<00:04:20.019> tied<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.979> sides<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.489> volumize<00:04:21.910> them

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.140 

and<00:04:26.690> again<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.710> rearranged<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.310> hair<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:28.970> that

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and again I rearranged my hair so that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.720 
and again I rearranged my hair so that
the<00:04:29.240> braids<00:04:29.510> are<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:30.290> top<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:30.890> split<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.520> top

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
the braids are on top I split the top

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.550 
the braids are on top I split the top
strands<00:04:32.240> into<00:04:32.420> equal<00:04:32.930> parts

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
strands into equal parts

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.830 
strands into equal parts
I<00:04:33.590> bring<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.460> strands<00:04:34.970> under<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.660> bottom

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
I bring the strands under the bottom

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:57.560 
I bring the strands under the bottom
section<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.770> tie<00:04:37.520> them<00:04:37.700> together

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.120 

now<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.630> need<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> arrange<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.440> ends<00:04:59.919> and
