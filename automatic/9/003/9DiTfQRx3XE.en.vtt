00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730 
top and I'm going to spread them out a
bit<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> would<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.019> easier<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> work<00:00:28.500> with

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
bit so it would be easier to work with

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189
