games<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.430> my<00:00:59.640> opinion<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> good

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
games but in my opinion that's a good

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
games but in my opinion that's a good
thing<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.469> BioShock<00:01:02.100> Infinite<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
thing because BioShock Infinite was a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.859 
thing because BioShock Infinite was a
masterpiece<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.110> needs<00:01:04.470> no<00:01:04.799> further<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
masterpiece and needs no further work I

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.620 
masterpiece and needs no further work I
would<00:01:06.869> love<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.500> further<00:01:07.770> Bioshock<00:01:08.430> games

would love to see further Bioshock games
but<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:10.340> think<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.400> infinite<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.360> good

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
but i think that infinite was good

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.060 
but i think that infinite was good
enough<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> alone<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
enough i think that alone is just a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
enough i think that alone is just a
perfect<00:01:17.119> statement<00:01:18.119> about<00:01:18.360> bioshock<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
perfect statement about bioshock and you

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to sink he kind of it seems like he's

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.729 
to sink he kind of it seems like he's
sensed<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.510> company<00:03:04.049> was<00:03:04.170> going<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.650> a

can
trends<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:53.220> game<00:03:53.520> development<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:54.300> that

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
trends in game development is that

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.920 
trends in game development is that
really<00:03:55.530> indie<00:03:56.280> development<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
really indie development is really the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.320 
really indie development is really the
method<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.470> go<00:03:58.680> these<00:03:59.010> days<00:03:59.070> especially<00:03:59.700> when

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
method to go these days especially when

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.090 
method to go these days especially when
you<00:04:00.420> have<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> lot<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.050> creativity<00:04:01.710> and

these days are indie games are small

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.770 
these days are indie games are small
companies<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.710> very<00:04:14.580> personal<00:04:15.180> input<00:04:15.600> and

companies with very personal input and
very<00:04:16.050> story-driven<00:04:16.650> games<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:18.390> think<00:04:18.600> this

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
very story-driven games and I think this

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.310 
very story-driven games and I think this
might<00:04:18.930> be<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.170> really<00:04:19.560> good<00:04:19.800> move<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.600> can't
