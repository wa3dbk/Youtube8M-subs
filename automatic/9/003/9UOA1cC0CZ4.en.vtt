 come over here grab you bounce grab 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
 another bounce of the sign made a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.000
 backflip and it reaches the roof of this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 minutes have the position in the number 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.680
 5000 to render is but send more 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.990
 acrobatics and we give you more here in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.420
 this top is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:17.149
 good at number 4 you 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.340
 brought to atlas blues urss who 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.500
 he sent a very different clip to everything 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.149
 that we have seen here in the top 5 and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.610
 hard to appreciate if we do not 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.710
 Okay so let's censor part 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.810
 right with our beautiful eggplant and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 as you can see out there one has 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.670
 too long in the air the backflip 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.950
 and get here to the dome and in the part of the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.569
 right does the same thing comes casting here 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.060
 the whole bike back to war this 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.429
 bounce made another back flip and it arrives 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.409
 again to the dome very good idea very 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.040
 original atlas you are in the number 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.410
 four 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.320
 and in position number 3 we're going to 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.930
 get 21 edu mix who comes here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.480
 the motorcycle through all the provinces of gta 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 arrives here follows continues to substract 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.320
 ramp date the whole body backwards it 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.150
 is going to put in that crane what will do or not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.770
 it will be or will not be or not if 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.990
 does it gets here in the part where 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 can walk very good people 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.350
 acrobatics let's see it again in 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.630
 slow motion so we can see how it has 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.550
 the degree of difficulty by how it is 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.860
 profiled and how the angle changes for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.260
 get here is helped with the bounce and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.690
 without any problem and scratch comes in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.850
 perfectly 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.000
 and in position number 2 you 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.210
 they put ace and former 97 who makes a 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.520
 acrobatics very very good honestly I 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.620
 or else I voted for this for number 1 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.330
 but as you voted too many for 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 the other let's make you guys 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.800
 you made it and we are going to pay attention 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.010
 here has more time grabbing 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.230
 little horses so lex here does something weird 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.100
 that holds good is that on camera 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.710
 slow 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.480
 here grabs with a very very rebound 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.430
 difficult all that speed 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 here done like to back and go back to 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.080
 grab another bounce that makes more 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.360
 speed to get here to the part of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.520
 up this roof it made me very very 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.740
 difficult what did flint but good 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.690
 is at number 2 and now we are going with 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.610
 the king of the week who is number one 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.400
 that all of you voted for nando 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.489
 youtube who makes an acrobatic 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.260
 extreme precision and original so the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.269
 he sent him so let's see how he comes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.980
 around here look for a ramp made all 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.989
 the body back to grab the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.720
 precision you need to turn in a 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.120
 precise moment and it stays up here 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.159
 this pipe of seaweed or of these of the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.230
 factories that take out all the waste 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.790
 As you can see I made the whole body 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.129
 back I have had come have no longer 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.629
 they had come says here is when I go 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.540
 to throw the whole body forward 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.459
 to lower the weight and enter with a lot 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.500
 lucky because he was going to fall but the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.840
 help bounce giving youtube 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.579

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.409
 five that you chose remember
