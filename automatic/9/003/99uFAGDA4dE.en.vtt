00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.390 
reason why I wants to get into knitting
I<00:00:11.790> saw<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> scarf<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.440> shop<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.070> few

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I saw it on a scarf in a shop a few

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
I saw it on a scarf in a shop a few
months<00:00:14.670> ago<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.150> really<00:00:15.570> wants<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> try<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
months ago and really wants to try and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.070 
months ago and really wants to try and
replicate<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.130> myself<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> got<00:00:18.750> going

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
replicate that myself so I got going

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.300 
replicate that myself so I got going
fairly<00:00:19.439> quickly<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.920> I've<00:00:20.070> actually

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
fairly quickly on this I've actually

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.240 
fairly quickly on this I've actually
started<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.539> completed<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.350> square<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
started and completed this square but I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.679 
started and completed this square but I
had<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> nightmare<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
had a bit of a nightmare actually and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
had a bit of a nightmare actually and
the<00:00:24.810> reason<00:00:25.170> was<00:00:25.400> tension<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.119> see

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the reason was tension and you can see

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.439 
the reason was tension and you can see
this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:27.869> finished<00:00:28.859> item<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> see

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this is my finished item and you can see

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.720 
this is my finished item and you can see
that<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.399> well

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that the first bit was going really well

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.299 
that the first bit was going really well
to<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.829> happened<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to about here and then what happened was

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.479 
to about here and then what happened was
I<00:00:35.899> went<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.989> sleep<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> next<00:00:38.370> day

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I went to sleep and got up the next day

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.660 
I went to sleep and got up the next day
and<00:00:38.879> started<00:00:39.329> again<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.840> suddenly<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.430> gone

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and started again and suddenly it's gone

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
and started again and suddenly it's gone
lube<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> side<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> see<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> also

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
lube out the side you can see and I also

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
lube out the side you can see and I also
forgot<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> lovely<00:00:46.110> sort<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
forgot what I was so the lovely sort of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.100 
forgot what I was so the lovely sort of
lattice<00:00:46.800> pattern<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.670> breaks<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
lattice pattern here breaks up and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.360 
lattice pattern here breaks up and
although<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.410> doesn't<00:00:49.440> look<00:00:49.680> too<00:00:50.039> bad

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
although it doesn't look too bad

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.029 
although it doesn't look too bad
this<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:51.030> probably<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.420> okay<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.140> wasn't

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this would probably be okay I wasn't

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.080 
this would probably be okay I wasn't
really<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.340> happy<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:53.969> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
look at the difference in tension and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
look at the difference in tension and
it's<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.990> tension<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's all about the tension that's the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
it's all about the tension that's the
key<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.729> beginning<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.049> know

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
key I'm beginning to see this and I know

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
key I'm beginning to see this and I know
it<00:01:19.409> says<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> magazine<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it says this in the magazine but I have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
it says this in the magazine but I have
chosen<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.689> ignore<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.200> occasion<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.860> now

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
chosen to ignore it on occasion and now

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
chosen to ignore it on occasion and now
I'm<00:01:23.159> beginning<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.970> really

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I'm beginning to see that I really

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
I'm beginning to see that I really
mustn't<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.170> must<00:01:25.350> check<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.710> my

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
mustn't I really must check that my

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
mustn't I really must check that my
tensions<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.330> other<00:01:27.479> thing<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.020> I'm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
tensions right the other thing is I'm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
tensions right the other thing is I'm
casting<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.640> different<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.270> well

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
casting off in a different way as well

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.090 
casting off in a different way as well
I'm<00:01:30.659> casting<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> back<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I'm casting off into the back of the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
I'm casting off into the back of the
needle<00:01:32.250> rather<00:01:32.610> than<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> front<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:34.290> I'm

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
needle rather than the front and I'm

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.340 
needle rather than the front and I'm
finding<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.420> creating<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.630> really

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
finding that this is creating a really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.880 
finding that this is creating a really
nice<00:01:37.710> neat<00:01:38.369> edge<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
nice neat edge and you have to be really

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.990 
nice neat edge and you have to be really
really<00:01:40.920> careful<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.520> sure<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> don't

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
really careful to make sure you don't

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399 
really careful to make sure you don't
pull<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> too<00:01:42.630> tight<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> pull

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
pull that too tight because if you pull

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
pull that too tight because if you pull
it<00:01:43.500> too<00:01:43.649> tight<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.820> were<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.360> still

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it too tight you were gonna it still

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480 
it too tight you were gonna it still
sort<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> starts<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.439> pucker<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
sort of starts to pucker up and you can

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
sort of starts to pucker up and you can
pull<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:49.170> tends

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
pull it a little bit but it still tends

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.069 
pull it a little bit but it still tends
to<00:01:49.799> pull<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> shape<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to pull it out of shape so this is a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
to pull it out of shape so this is a
perfect<00:01:52.590> 15<00:01:52.950> centimeter<00:01:53.460> square<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> actually

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
perfect 15 centimeter square I actually

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.280 
perfect 15 centimeter square I actually
think<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> first<00:01:54.750> square<00:01:54.990> I've<00:01:55.110> done

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
think this is the first square I've done

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.490 
think this is the first square I've done
that<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.619> perfectly<00:01:56.280> 15<00:01:56.670> centimeters<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that is perfectly 15 centimeters and the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.410 
that is perfectly 15 centimeters and the
most<00:01:58.680> stitch<00:01:58.950> design<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.090> pretty

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

this to my arsenal of squares that are
growing<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.429> exciting
