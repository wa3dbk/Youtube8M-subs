00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
into it so you use one of these

candy as possible so a lot of people are

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
candy as possible so a lot of people are
picking<00:01:24.299> mobility<00:01:24.780> heroes<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.380> anti-mage

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
picking mobility heroes like anti-mage

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
picking mobility heroes like anti-mage
or<00:01:26.220> queen<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> pain<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
or queen of pain because they then can

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
or queen of pain because they then can
blink<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.810> while<00:01:28.020> stealing<00:01:28.259> candy

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
blink in and out while stealing candy

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
blink in and out while stealing candy
and<00:01:28.829> nature's<00:01:29.790> prophet<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.299> example<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and nature's prophet for example the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.050 
and nature's prophet for example the
best<00:01:31.890> hero<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> counter<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> guys

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
best hero to counter this if you guys

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
best hero to counter this if you guys
are<00:01:33.210> annoyed<00:01:33.720> by<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.259> probably<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
are annoyed by this is probably going to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
are annoyed by this is probably going to
be<00:01:35.189> disruptors<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.450> reason<00:01:36.750> disruptor<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
be disruptors so the reason disruptor is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.390 
be disruptors so the reason disruptor is
really<00:01:37.560> useful<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.280> use

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
really useful is because you can use

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
really useful is because you can use
glimpse<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.909> send<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.240> opponent's<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
glimpse to send your opponent's back so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.840 
glimpse to send your opponent's back so
as<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> blink<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.400> cast<00:01:41.610> Chain

as they're about to blink you cast Chain

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
as they're about to blink you cast Chain
Lightning<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> cast<00:01:42.659> lightning<00:01:42.869> storm

Lightning are you cast lightning storm

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.810 
Lightning are you cast lightning storm
or<00:01:43.560> whatever<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.890> called<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.189> them<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
or whatever it's called on them and that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.219

you can glimpse them back to your candy
area<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.229> hopefully<00:01:49.530> kill<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.250> played

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
area and hopefully kill them so I played

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.770 
area and hopefully kill them so I played
at<00:01:50.759> least<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.060> played<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.570> hope<00:01:51.659> your

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
at least I played to just hope your

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.929 
at least I played to just hope your
games<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.610> second

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
games my first one really well my second

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
games my first one really well my second
one<00:01:54.060> didn't<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.420> well<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:56.490> some

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
one didn't go so well so I got some

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
one didn't go so well so I got some
mixed<00:01:56.909> results<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.469> if<00:01:58.469> you're<00:01:58.680> worried

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
mixed results but if you're worried

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.319 
mixed results but if you're worried
about<00:01:58.950> mobility<00:01:59.219> heroes<00:01:59.759> disruptors

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
about mobility heroes disruptors

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
about mobility heroes disruptors
probably<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> best<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> counter<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.350> other

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
probably on the best to counter it other

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
probably on the best to counter it other
than<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.130> there's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> couple<00:02:03.240> other<00:02:03.420> abuses

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
than that there's a couple other abuses

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
than that there's a couple other abuses
you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:04.680> try<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you can do you can also try that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
you can do you can also try that
mobility<00:02:05.490> lineup<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> think

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
mobility lineup if you like but I think

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
mobility lineup if you like but I think
it's<00:02:07.439> most<00:02:07.619> fun<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.069> grab<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.520> random<00:02:08.789> hero

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's most fun just to grab a random hero

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's most fun just to grab a random hero
and<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.629> five<00:02:09.810> man<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> start<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and just go five man at the start of the

me know in the comments below I don't
really<00:04:39.960> know<00:04:40.169> if<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.410> should<00:04:40.440> technically<00:04:41.099> ask

for<00:04:42.210> permission<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.870> post<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.449> guess<00:04:45.449> I

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
for permission to post it I guess I

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.510 
for permission to post it I guess I
probably<00:04:45.750> should<00:04:46.139> I'm<00:04:46.319> not<00:04:46.470> sure<00:04:46.530> let<00:04:47.310> me<00:04:47.370> know

probably should I'm not sure let me know
guess<00:04:47.699> all<00:04:47.880> right<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.569> think<00:04:48.840> that's<00:04:48.960> about

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
guess all right and I think that's about

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.510 
guess all right and I think that's about
it<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.319> hopefully<00:04:49.440> some<00:04:49.770> more<00:04:49.889> diretide<00:04:50.310> new

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520
