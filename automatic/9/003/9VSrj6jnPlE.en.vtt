00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello my name is tiphaine car wade 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.240
 and I will show you today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.240
 how to mold a bunny 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.750
 so I'll start by showing you 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.270
 how to decorate the mold to have a 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.189
 pretty milk chocolate rabbit that is 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.189
 temperate and a small brush 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.470
 I will do the same thing with my 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.020
 white chocolate a little colder than the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.020
 milk chocolate + 26 27 m 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.739
 we cleaned your brushes it's great 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.060
 easy you put a little bit of 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.309
 dishwashing product on it for you 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.320
 to protect against the bordelais viÃ© and that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.420
 cleans the brushes very well we're going 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.880
 let the chocolate cool our 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.790
 chocolate and now crystallized we're going 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.790
 so be able to start molding the rabbit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 is my carpet too to remove the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 air bubbles that's very important 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.820
 miss your world we return the mold 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.040
 above that it will allow us to have 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.470
 well-being edges to be able after 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.340
 stick the two parts of the lap after 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340
 rabbit an egg 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.110
 so always same principle we tap 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 for not having a thick chocolate 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 too big jump into the unknown 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.670
 same principle with the bell 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.210
 we expect to see that it flows on 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.210
 all edges 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.610
 our Easter casts have now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.610
 hardened we will be able to unmold 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.409
 a hood a little bit of history 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.659
 take off in fact the chocolate or the world 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.150
 and then 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.579
 that's it for the spell 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.959
 delicately there this is what happens 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.299
 when the chocolate is a bit too hot 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.189
 now that our rabbit and unmold 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.170
 we're going to stick the little ears 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:45.549
 in the chocolate the paws in the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.239
 chocolate and then we just welded where 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.739
 the pose like that to unmold the bell 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.010
 we must first start by removing 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.139
 fasteners you have here small 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.139
 express traces to put your fingers 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.269
 so here we go now decorated 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.269
 egg 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.599
 so a little trick if you want 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.700
 decorate your egg with something 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.580
 all end you blue soaked very 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.430
 slightly in the chocolate will fool you 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.630
 in our little lives 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.580
 if you want to do that especially the offer 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.280
 at that moment you take a small 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.620
 brush you paint the egg with some 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.500
 melted chocolate and after you roll 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.500
 the egg like that 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.159

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.170
