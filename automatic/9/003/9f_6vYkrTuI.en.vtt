00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
over the ballistic knife which I got to

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.080 
over the ballistic knife which I got to
max<00:00:05.580> prestige<00:00:06.150> max<00:00:06.629> level<00:00:07.160> it's<00:00:08.160> only<00:00:08.970> got

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
like six levels and a prestige so it's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.509 
like six levels and a prestige so it's
not<00:00:11.910> particularly<00:00:12.240> difficult<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.170> there

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
not particularly difficult to get there

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.430 
not particularly difficult to get there
like<00:00:14.519> kind<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.880> level<00:00:15.210> wise<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
like kind of level wise but it is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.740 
like kind of level wise but it is
difficult<00:00:17.100> well<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.270> really<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> gun

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
difficult well it's not really a gun

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
difficult well it's not really a gun
that<00:00:19.250> special<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> second

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
that special to use it's the second

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.330 
that special to use it's the second
special<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.930> unlock<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.529> your<00:00:22.740> secondaries

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
special you unlock for your secondaries

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.670 
special you unlock for your secondaries
and<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> pretty<00:00:24.810> late<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.289> level

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and you get it pretty late at like level

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.790 
and you get it pretty late at like level
49<00:00:26.010> level<00:00:26.460> 50<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.170> for<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
49 level 50 and for what it is you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.009 
49 level 50 and for what it is you
probably<00:00:29.010> shouldn't<00:00:29.369> get<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.730> late<00:00:30.019> but

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
probably shouldn't get it that late but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
probably shouldn't get it that late but
i'll<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.560> over<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> class<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.460> i

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
i'll be going over the class that i

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
i'll be going over the class that i
would<00:00:32.730> recommend<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.930> only<00:00:34.079> like

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
would recommend using there's only like

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
would recommend using there's only like
one<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.800> would<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.719> there's<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
one i would use but there's a lot of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
one i would use but there's a lot of
variants<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.980> choose<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.850> want

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
variants that you can choose if you want

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.810 
variants that you can choose if you want
but<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.320> doesn't<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.860> any<00:00:41.070> attachments<00:00:41.760> or

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
but it doesn't have any attachments or

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
but it doesn't have any attachments or
anything<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> currently<00:00:42.890> give<00:00:43.890> advice

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
anything so I currently give advice

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
anything so I currently give advice
about<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.289> honest<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.100> all

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
about that but to be honest this is all

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.560 
about that but to be honest this is all
about<00:00:48.000> place<00:00:48.300> though<00:00:48.770> this<00:00:49.770> weapon<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:51.030> not

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
about place though this weapon I'm not

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.090 
about place though this weapon I'm not
going<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> call<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> gun<00:00:52.289> I'll<00:00:52.559> try<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
going to call it a gun I'll try not to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.150 
going to call it a gun I'll try not to
anyway<00:00:53.570> but<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.660> weapon<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> completely

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
anyway but this weapon is completely

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.420 
anyway but this weapon is completely
about<00:00:56.520> play<00:00:56.789> style<00:00:57.149> rather<00:00:57.449> than<00:00:58.430> attachments

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
about play style rather than attachments

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.569 
about play style rather than attachments
or<00:00:59.579> use<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.980> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> silencer

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
or use it I like if you put a silencer

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.810 
or use it I like if you put a silencer
on<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> makes<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> better<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.660> something

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
on it makes it better or something

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
on it makes it better or something
basically<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> stealthy<00:01:07.380> with

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
basically you need to be stealthy with

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700 
basically you need to be stealthy with
the<00:01:08.700> ballistic<00:01:09.090> knife<00:01:09.290> obviously<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.470> only

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the ballistic knife obviously it's only

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
the ballistic knife obviously it's only
got<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.010> limited<00:01:11.340> lunge<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.570> does<00:01:12.750> have

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
got a limited lunge but it does have

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.940 
got a limited lunge but it does have
that<00:01:14.540> was<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> ballistic<00:01:16.229> knife<00:01:16.409> obviously

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that was it ballistic knife obviously

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
that was it ballistic knife obviously
that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> fire<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.689> fires<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that you can fire out and it fires in a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
that you can fire out and it fires in a
straight<00:01:19.470> line<00:01:19.500> dips<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.490> bit<00:01:20.610> dips<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
straight line dips a little bit dips a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
straight line dips a little bit dips a
lot<00:01:21.900> less<00:01:22.110> than<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.409> black<00:01:22.619> ops<00:01:22.770> 1<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
lot less than on black ops 1 which is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
lot less than on black ops 1 which is
kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> hard<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.420> used<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.530> use

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
kind of hard to get used to if you use

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.969 
kind of hard to get used to if you use
the<00:01:25.740> ballistic<00:01:26.220> knife<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.670> black<00:01:26.970> ops<00:01:27.150> 1<00:01:27.979> but

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the ballistic knife on black ops 1 but

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.719 
the ballistic knife on black ops 1 but
you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.909> used<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> pretty<00:01:30.450> easily<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
you can get used to it pretty easily and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.719 
you can get used to it pretty easily and
don't<00:01:32.729> run<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> secondary<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:35.549> going

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
don't run this as a secondary I'm going

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
don't run this as a secondary I'm going
to<00:01:35.790> say<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> complete

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
to say that because it is a complete

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.920 
to say that because it is a complete
waste<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.060> run<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> secondary

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
waste if you don't run it as a secondary

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.450 
waste if you don't run it as a secondary
then<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> combat<00:01:40.860> knife<00:01:41.009> anyway

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
then you get the combat knife anyway

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.999 
then you get the combat knife anyway
which<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.780> tight<00:01:42.990> situation<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.860> you're

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
which in a tight situation when you're

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
which in a tight situation when you're
kind<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.369> running<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> where<00:01:45.509> you've<00:01:45.659> ran<00:01:45.840> out

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
kind of running it where you've ran out

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
kind of running it where you've ran out
of<00:01:46.020> ammo<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.380> something<00:01:46.909> switching<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
of ammo or something switching to a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
of ammo or something switching to a
combat<00:01:48.479> knife<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.470> being<00:01:49.680> able<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.979> hit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
combat knife and just being able to hit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
combat knife and just being able to hit
the<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.399> trigger<00:01:50.700> rather<00:01:51.509> than<00:01:51.600> having<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the right trigger rather than having to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.700 
the right trigger rather than having to
press<00:01:52.200> either<00:01:52.470> B<00:01:52.740> or<00:01:52.770> RB<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.960> much<00:01:54.960> easier<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
press either B or RB is much easier and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.850 
press either B or RB is much easier and
just<00:01:55.740> seems<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:56.790> natural<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
just seems a lot more natural so if

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.530 
just seems a lot more natural so if
you're<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> tight<00:01:59.490> spot<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.360> will

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you're in a tight spot then that will

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.139 
you're in a tight spot then that will
probably<00:02:00.750> help<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.579> than

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
probably help you out a lot more than

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.670 
probably help you out a lot more than
having<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> blessed<00:02:04.170> knife<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
having to get the blessed knife out and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.039 
having to get the blessed knife out and
like<00:02:05.490> firing<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> knife<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.840> think

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
like firing the knife because you think

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
like firing the knife because you think
that<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.320> better<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:07.920> missing<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that will be better and then missing it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.220 
that will be better and then missing it
or<00:02:08.550> something<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
or something so don't do that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.170 
or something so don't do that
but<00:02:12.830> if<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.159> want<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.459> run<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.879> primary

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
but if you want to run it as a primary

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.699 
but if you want to run it as a primary
because<00:02:14.599> you're<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> knife<00:02:15.140> only<00:02:15.349> player

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
because you're like a knife only player

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.309 
because you're like a knife only player
or<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.849> want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.209> pro<00:02:17.569> stealth<00:02:17.989> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
or you just want to be pro stealth and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.460 
or you just want to be pro stealth and
like<00:02:18.849> not<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:19.970> care<00:02:20.629> about<00:02:20.840> shooting

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
like not really care about shooting

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.280 
like not really care about shooting
people<00:02:21.799> all<00:02:22.700> you'd<00:02:22.909> like<00:02:23.330> as<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.720> said<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.989> knife

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
people all you'd like as I said a knife

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.380 
people all you'd like as I said a knife
only<00:02:24.470> player<00:02:24.830> then<00:02:25.519> where<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.060> you're<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> knife

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
only player then where if you're a knife

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.119 
only player then where if you're a knife
only<00:02:26.569> player<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.049> you've<00:02:27.379> been<00:02:27.709> missing<00:02:28.010> out

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
only player then you've been missing out

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.780 
only player then you've been missing out
you<00:02:28.580> know<00:02:28.700> because<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.799> shoots<00:02:30.799> knives<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
you know because it's shoots knives and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.330 
you know because it's shoots knives and
stuff<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:33.200> if<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.590> want<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.860> bit<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.040> fun

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
stuff but if you just want a bit of fun

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.330 
stuff but if you just want a bit of fun
then<00:02:34.730> putting<00:02:35.629> this<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.379> secondary<00:02:37.040> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
then putting this on as a secondary and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.309 
then putting this on as a secondary and
then<00:02:37.519> obviously<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.480> don't<00:02:38.629> like<00:02:38.870> secondary

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
then obviously you don't like secondary

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.259 
then obviously you don't like secondary
gun<00:02:39.500> fight<00:02:39.709> or<00:02:39.890> anything<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.790> do<00:02:41.030> have<00:02:41.209> a

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
gun fight or anything so you do have a

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.940 
gun fight or anything so you do have a
lot<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.510> points<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.079> put<00:02:42.260> wherever<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.709> want

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
lot of points to put wherever you want

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.819 
lot of points to put wherever you want
and<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:44.390> way<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.569> would<00:02:44.930> recommend<00:02:45.290> doing<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
and the way I would recommend doing it

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.390 
and the way I would recommend doing it
is<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:47.299> go<00:02:47.480> more<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.379> perks<00:02:48.680> than<00:02:49.099> anything

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
is to go more on to perks than anything

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
is to go more on to perks than anything
else<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:50.599> perks<00:02:50.840> are<00:02:51.109> going<00:02:51.349> to<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> what

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
else the perks are going to be what

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.460 
else the perks are going to be what
helped<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.700> most<00:02:52.900> compared<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.959> like

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
helped you the most compared to like

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.530 
helped you the most compared to like
having<00:02:55.250> loads<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.609> equipment<00:02:55.849> or<00:02:56.209> something

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
having loads of equipment or something

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.830 
having loads of equipment or something
but<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.560> was<00:02:58.160> using<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.609> on<00:02:58.790> demolition<00:02:59.329> and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
but I was using it on demolition and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.039 
but I was using it on demolition and
search<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.440> destroy<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.489> even<00:03:02.359> like<00:03:02.390> on

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
search and destroy but even like on

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.140 
search and destroy but even like on
anything<00:03:03.349> else<00:03:03.650> because<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.970> get

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
anything else because you have to get

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.119 
anything else because you have to get
really<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.690> close<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.170> them<00:03:06.290> or<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.010> have

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
really really close to them or you have

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.830 
really really close to them or you have
to<00:03:07.280> fire<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.730> knife<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.180> need<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.420> be<00:03:08.540> able<00:03:08.660> to

to fire the knife you need to be able to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.470

to them and just kind of stay off the
radar<00:03:14.569> completely<00:03:15.200> when<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.010> fire<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.310> you

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.240 
them cold-blooded and things like that
to<00:03:37.130> stay<00:03:37.819> kind<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.930> have<00:03:39.530> no<00:03:39.560> name<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.190> you

to stay kind of have no name and you

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.009 
to stay kind of have no name and you
able<00:03:40.669> to<00:03:40.760> lie<00:03:40.940> down<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.359> wait<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.900> go

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
able to lie down and wait for you to go

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.710 
able to lie down and wait for you to go
past<00:03:42.230> before<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.769> knife<00:03:42.919> them<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.180> another

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
past before you knife them and another

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.050 
past before you knife them and another
thing<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.440> may<00:03:45.590> want<00:03:45.859> if<00:03:46.040> you're<00:03:46.700> going<00:03:46.880> on

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
thing is you may want if you're going on

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.629 
thing is you may want if you're going on
Search<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.450> Destroy<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.930> stuff<00:03:48.190> we're<00:03:49.190> being

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
Search and Destroy and stuff we're being

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.120 
Search and Destroy and stuff we're being
quiet<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.239> also<00:03:50.630> good<00:03:50.840> then<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.889> would

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
quiet is also good then I would

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.400 
quiet is also good then I would
definitely<00:03:52.400> recommend<00:03:52.760> dead<00:03:53.180> silence<00:03:53.660> but

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
definitely recommend dead silence but

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.670 
definitely recommend dead silence but
for<00:03:54.650> an<00:03:54.739> objective<00:03:55.250> game<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.669> demolition

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
for an objective game like demolition

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.349 
for an objective game like demolition
having<00:03:57.680> flak<00:03:58.010> jacket<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.669> tactical<00:03:59.150> mask

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
having flak jacket and tactical mask

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.300 
having flak jacket and tactical mask
means<00:04:00.169> you<00:04:00.349> can<00:04:00.530> just<00:04:00.709> run<00:04:00.980> through

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
means you can just run through

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.629 
means you can just run through
objectives<00:04:02.299> without<00:04:02.900> being<00:04:03.319> killed<00:04:04.069> or<00:04:04.430> like

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
objectives without being killed or like

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.690 
objectives without being killed or like
impaired<00:04:05.120> by<00:04:05.650> shock<00:04:06.650> charges<00:04:07.129> or<00:04:07.340> flash

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
impaired by shock charges or flash

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.750 
impaired by shock charges or flash
grenades<00:04:08.389> or<00:04:08.660> stun<00:04:09.109> grenades<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.590> stuff<00:04:09.829> as

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
grenades or stun grenades and stuff as

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.050 
grenades or stun grenades and stuff as
way<00:04:11.569> of<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.930> tactical<00:04:12.500> mask<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.819> just

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
way of the tactical mask so it just

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.449 
way of the tactical mask so it just
means<00:04:14.269> if<00:04:14.569> you're<00:04:14.750> running<00:04:15.349> like<00:04:16.010> through<00:04:16.430> a

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
means if you're running like through a

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.240 
means if you're running like through a
bee<00:04:16.729> flag<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.239> domination<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.410> they<00:04:18.949> throw

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
bee flag on domination and they throw

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.949 
bee flag on domination and they throw
obviously<00:04:19.699> a<00:04:19.729> couple<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.030> flashes<00:04:20.479> or<00:04:20.659> stuns

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
obviously a couple of flashes or stuns

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.080 
obviously a couple of flashes or stuns
then<00:04:21.739> they're<00:04:22.099> going<00:04:22.219> to<00:04:22.310> expect<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.000> be

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
then they're going to expect you to be

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.120 
then they're going to expect you to be
stuck<00:04:23.360> in<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.690> middle<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> map<00:04:24.200> still<00:04:24.530> but

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
stuck in the middle of the map still but

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.910 
stuck in the middle of the map still but
you<00:04:25.340> can<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.669> run

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
you can just run

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.350 
you can just run
straight<00:04:26.220> through<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:26.730> up<00:04:26.820> close<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.240> them

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
straight through it get up close to them

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.030 
straight through it get up close to them
and<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.870> them<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.260> they<00:04:28.350> will<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.710> no<00:04:28.830> idea

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
and know them and they will have no idea

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.250 
and know them and they will have no idea
what<00:04:29.160> happened<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:30.300> smoke<00:04:30.720> grenade<00:04:31.050> is

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
what happened the smoke grenade is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.010 
what happened the smoke grenade is
actually<00:04:32.100> like<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.610> one<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.660> best<00:04:33.900> things

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
actually like the one of the best things

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.630 
actually like the one of the best things
on<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.410> class<00:04:34.620> when<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> first<00:04:35.220> put<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.520> on

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
on the class when you first put it on

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.360 
on the class when you first put it on
you<00:04:35.790> may<00:04:35.910> not<00:04:36.060> use<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.510> at<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.830> for

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you may not use it at all but for

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.450 
you may not use it at all but for
demolition<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.150> domination<00:04:39.590> domination<00:04:40.590> you

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
demolition and domination domination you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.830 
demolition and domination domination you
can<00:04:41.580> throw<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.880> down<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.270> flags<00:04:42.510> or<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
can throw it down on the flags or the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.570 
can throw it down on the flags or the
bombs<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.350> obviously<00:04:43.890> they<00:04:44.040> can't<00:04:44.070> see<00:04:44.430> you

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
bombs and obviously they can't see you

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.030 
bombs and obviously they can't see you
especially<00:04:44.880> if<00:04:45.150> you've<00:04:45.270> got<00:04:45.390> cold<00:04:45.630> blooded

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
especially if you've got cold blooded

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.560 
especially if you've got cold blooded
because<00:04:47.040> your<00:04:47.160> name<00:04:47.340> won't<00:04:47.490> come<00:04:47.700> up<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.030> you

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
because your name won't come up and you

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.350 
because your name won't come up and you
can<00:04:48.720> cap<00:04:48.930> objectives<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:49.890> easily<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:51.180> can

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
can cap objectives really easily you can

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.280 
can cap objectives really easily you can
stay<00:04:51.630> like<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:52.950> flag<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.000> they<00:04:54.720> may<00:04:54.900> come<00:04:55.110> in

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
stay like on a flag and they may come in

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.140 
stay like on a flag and they may come in
and<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.890> see<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.550> there's<00:04:56.760> someone<00:04:57.000> there

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
and like see that there's someone there

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.390 
and like see that there's someone there
but<00:04:57.930> they<00:04:58.080> don't<00:04:58.200> really<00:04:58.380> know<00:04:58.620> who<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.010> so

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
but they don't really know who it is so

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.650 
but they don't really know who it is so
they'll<00:04:59.580> walk<00:04:59.790> off<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.210> then<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.390> can<00:05:00.510> get

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
they'll walk off and then you can get

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.530 
they'll walk off and then you can get
the<00:05:00.750> cap<00:05:01.400> planting<00:05:02.400> bombs<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.880> stuff<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.300> much

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
the cap planting bombs and stuff is much

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.870 
the cap planting bombs and stuff is much
much<00:05:03.810> easier<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.250> ballistic<00:05:05.580> knife<00:05:05.610> is

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
much easier so the ballistic knife is

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.630 
much easier so the ballistic knife is
kind<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.380> very<00:05:07.380> what<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> used<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.310> in<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.460> very

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
kind of very what I used it in a very

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.060 
kind of very what I used it in a very
objective<00:05:09.240> way<00:05:09.450> because<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.650> stay

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
objective way because you can just stay

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.560 
objective way because you can just stay
really<00:05:11.280> quiet<00:05:11.670> and<00:05:11.850> people<00:05:12.210> don't<00:05:12.330> know

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
really quiet and people don't know

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.360 
really quiet and people don't know
you're<00:05:12.780> there<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.710> can<00:05:14.010> plant<00:05:14.220> an

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
you're there so you can plant an

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.280 
you're there so you can plant an
objective<00:05:14.880> or<00:05:15.090> kill<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> people<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.260> are

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
objective or kill the people that are

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.740 
objective or kill the people that are
there<00:05:16.410> without<00:05:17.310> anyone<00:05:17.760> really<00:05:17.940> realizing

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
there without anyone really realizing

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.320 
there without anyone really realizing
and<00:05:18.930> then<00:05:19.560> obviously<00:05:20.490> by<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:20.970> point<00:05:21.120> they're

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
and then obviously by that point they're

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.820 
and then obviously by that point they're
dead<00:05:21.540> then<00:05:22.380> I've<00:05:22.770> got<00:05:22.830> c4<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.670> rather<00:05:24.450> than<00:05:24.830> a

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
dead then I've got c4 on rather than a

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.970 
dead then I've got c4 on rather than a
combat<00:05:26.700> knife<00:05:26.880> because<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:28.080> don't<00:05:28.650> use<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
combat knife because I don't use the

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.260 
combat knife because I don't use the
combat<00:05:29.280> knives<00:05:29.460> because<00:05:29.670> obviously<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.150> can

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
combat knives because obviously you can

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.880 
combat knives because obviously you can
just<00:05:30.450> shoot<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.720> ballistic<00:05:31.110> knife<00:05:31.140> which

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
just shoot the ballistic knife which

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.830 
just shoot the ballistic knife which
kind<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.250> has<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.490> same<00:05:32.700> effect<00:05:32.820> other<00:05:33.570> than

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
kind of has the same effect other than

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.620 
kind of has the same effect other than
they<00:05:34.170> don't<00:05:34.350> bounce<00:05:34.590> off<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.270> just<00:05:36.480> like

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
they don't bounce off and I just like

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.710 
they don't bounce off and I just like
throwing<00:05:37.110> c4<00:05:37.530> into<00:05:37.860> objectives<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.550> stuff<00:05:38.790> to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
throwing c4 into objectives and stuff to

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.260 
throwing c4 into objectives and stuff to
clear<00:05:39.960> out<00:05:40.170> before<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.530> run<00:05:40.770> in<00:05:40.980> but<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.030> can

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
clear out before I run in but you can

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.360 
clear out before I run in but you can
obviously<00:05:42.540> put<00:05:42.960> on<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.410> combat<00:05:43.800> knife<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.250> go

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
obviously put on the combat knife and go

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.070 
obviously put on the combat knife and go
for<00:05:45.020> where's<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.280> danger<00:05:47.280> close<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.850> have<00:05:48.810> two

for where's it danger close and have two
of<00:05:49.230> them<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.500> obviously<00:05:50.010> being<00:05:50.970> able<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.300> fire

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
of them and obviously being able to fire

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.850 
of them and obviously being able to fire
if<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:51.810> miss<00:05:51.990> with<00:05:52.170> the<00:05:52.230> ballistic<00:05:52.590> knife<00:05:52.620> you

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
if you miss with the ballistic knife you

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.730

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.770 
like gone straight into their face and
it's<00:07:10.890> just<00:07:11.340> a<00:07:11.490> bit<00:07:11.640> confusing<00:07:12.150> to<00:07:12.450> be<00:07:12.540> honest

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
it's just a bit confusing to be honest

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.230 
it's just a bit confusing to be honest
why<00:07:13.500> it<00:07:13.560> doesn't<00:07:14.070> work<00:07:14.100> it<00:07:14.520> may<00:07:14.700> just<00:07:14.730> be<00:07:14.970> my

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
why it doesn't work it may just be my

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.930 
why it doesn't work it may just be my
connection<00:07:15.840> but<00:07:16.190> other<00:07:17.190> people<00:07:17.640> definitely

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
connection but other people definitely

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.480 
connection but other people definitely
say<00:07:18.300> it<00:07:18.420> too<00:07:18.630> and<00:07:18.840> you<00:07:19.470> see<00:07:19.710> people<00:07:20.100> nothing

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
who'd like lunge into you or through you

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.620 
who'd like lunge into you or through you
or<00:07:23.820> like<00:07:24.540> around<00:07:24.930> you<00:07:25.200> and<00:07:25.380> you<00:07:26.340> just<00:07:26.580> watch<00:07:27.420> it

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
or like around you and you just watch it

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.630 
or like around you and you just watch it
from<00:07:27.750> their<00:07:27.960> point<00:07:28.170> of<00:07:28.350> view<00:07:28.410> and<00:07:28.680> they

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
from their point of view and they

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.820 
from their point of view and they
definitely<00:07:29.820> should<00:07:30.120> have<00:07:30.390> got<00:07:30.720> the<00:07:30.870> kill<00:07:31.080> it

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.380 
just seems kind of mad how people have
stuck<00:07:35.280> it<00:07:35.430> out<00:07:35.520> and<00:07:35.580> I<00:07:35.880> don't<00:07:35.940> really<00:07:36.180> know<00:07:36.360> how

stuck it out and I don't really know how
they<00:07:36.780> have<00:07:37.190> but<00:07:38.190> I<00:07:38.430> wouldn't<00:07:39.060> recommend<00:07:39.380> like

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460 
they have but I wouldn't recommend like

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.850

definitely don't think that it's going
to<00:07:48.990> be<00:07:49.110> really<00:07:49.980> easy<00:07:50.130> like<00:07:50.690> modern<00:07:51.690> warfare<00:07:51.840> 2
