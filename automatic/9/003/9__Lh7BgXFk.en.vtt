00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
 they are the way where they ran nobody nobody 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.250
 place I have cruel lags generally pipets 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.740
 Generally yes and here it is now lags in the game 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 These are the lags all slows me down 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 in short the record goes ok always it's 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.099
 lags in the game look all slow 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.550
 general slideshow fucked at all up 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.550
 brakes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.890
 ah yeah they probably also slow down everything 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.829
 ja 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.590
 and now the game hung up before there were brakes 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.590
 then the game hung 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.090
 fucked up 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.049
 I thought the girls were far away there 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.030
 glitches and brakes begin 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:15.350
 hour again freezes a hundred pounds see 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 what horrible glitches 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.409
 Now I will write him messages that I have 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.200
 just slows down even with my set-top box 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.200
 brakes see what happens a 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 but what brakes 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.320
 Now I will write a message to him even to us 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:59.860
 I can not write right now 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.860
 went all the brakes 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.120
 and now I ask you now is no longer 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.950
 then you brake the brakes too 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.950
 shorter began and everything hung nafig 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.380
 given to slow down 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.069
 It does not slow down specifically, of course, but all 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.069
 equally slow 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 fish soup and here at all 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.360
 violent brakes now ok this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.250
 it rained and they were on the bugger and fuck 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.780
 although before the rain was already seen 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.410
 nothing was a kind of brakes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:09.850
 oh my god damned again 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:09.850
 And not well, so it's impossible to play days
