00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
and it's on the Josie Maran

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.839 
and it's on the Josie Maran
chair<00:00:08.490> argon<00:00:09.059> milk<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.190> I<00:00:11.190> thought<00:00:11.550> about

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
chair argon milk and I thought about

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.910 
chair argon milk and I thought about
filming<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:12.719> impression<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
filming a first impression on this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.600 
filming a first impression on this
product

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
product

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
product
whenever<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.059> picked<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.680> figured

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
whenever I picked it up but I figured

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.900 
whenever I picked it up but I figured
like<00:00:17.869> it's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.020> moisturizer<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.699> first

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
like it's a moisturizer and a first

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820 
like it's a moisturizer and a first
impression<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.199> didn't<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.710> would

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
impression I just didn't think it would

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.179 
impression I just didn't think it would
be<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.160> effective<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.539> helpful<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
be very effective or helpful so I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
be very effective or helpful so I
figured<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.240> better<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.599> me

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
figured it would just be better for me

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.220 
figured it would just be better for me
to<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.349> over<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> month<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:30.210> longer<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
to use this over a month or longer and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
to use this over a month or longer and
do<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> review<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
do like a review on it which is what I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.250 
do like a review on it which is what I
did<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.500> been<00:00:34.739> using<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.219> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

I really like the packaging on this now

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.699 
I really like the packaging on this now
for<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.790> product<00:03:45.120> itself<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.260> does<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
for the product itself like it does do a

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
for the product itself like it does do a
good<00:03:46.799> job<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.220> moisturizing<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.060> face<00:03:48.480> and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
good job of moisturizing your face and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.160 
good job of moisturizing your face and
but<00:03:49.769> honestly<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.310> don't<00:03:50.579> feel<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.840> as

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
but honestly I don't feel that it is as

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.640 
but honestly I don't feel that it is as
moisturizing<00:03:53.010> as<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.519> think<00:03:53.910> as<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:55.500> would

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
moisturizing as you think as you would

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.280 
moisturizing as you think as you would
think<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:56.010> would<00:03:56.190> be<00:03:56.569> because<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.930> an<00:03:58.079> oil

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
think it would be because it is an oil

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.839 
think it would be because it is an oil
like<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.799> expected<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.579> really<00:03:59.819> really

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
oil I feel that way about my face and

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.940 
oil I feel that way about my face and
this<00:05:32.850> stuff<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.690> know<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:34.080> was<00:05:34.200> just<00:05:34.380> like<00:05:34.680> any

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
this stuff you know it was just like any

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.620 
this stuff you know it was just like any
other<00:05:35.190> time<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:35.820> would<00:05:35.910> use<00:05:36.270> any<00:05:36.480> other

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
other time that I would use any other

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.390 
other time that I would use any other
moisturizer<00:05:37.230> and<00:05:37.470> wake<00:05:37.620> up<00:05:37.800> my<00:05:38.010> face<00:05:38.220> would

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
moisturizer and wake up my face would

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.340 
moisturizer and wake up my face would
feel<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.670> same<00:05:38.700> it's<00:05:39.240> not<00:05:39.360> like<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> horrible

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
feel the same it's not like a horrible

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.930 
feel the same it's not like a horrible
product<00:05:40.710> or<00:05:40.980> anything<00:05:41.100> I<00:05:41.520> think<00:05:41.820> it's

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
product or anything I think it's

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.990 
product or anything I think it's
something<00:05:42.180> worth<00:05:42.690> trying<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:44.580> know<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:44.880> at

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
something worth trying you know like at

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520 
something worth trying you know like at
least<00:05:45.120> once<00:05:45.390> or<00:05:45.480> something<00:05:45.780> especially<00:05:46.350> if

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
least once or something especially if

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.390 
least once or something especially if
you<00:05:46.680> do<00:05:46.830> have<00:05:47.100> drier<00:05:47.610> skin<00:05:48.260> but<00:05:49.370> honestly<00:05:50.370> I

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
you do have drier skin but honestly I

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.950 
you do have drier skin but honestly I
would<00:05:50.730> recommend<00:05:51.150> just<00:05:51.210> using<00:05:51.360> coconut<00:05:51.750> oil

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
would recommend just using coconut oil

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.820 
would recommend just using coconut oil
or<00:05:52.670> using<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:54.000> other<00:05:54.390> product<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.020> origins

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
or using that other product that origins

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.620 
or using that other product that origins
a<00:05:55.920> perfect<00:05:56.310> world<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.760> like<00:05:56.970> both<00:05:57.390> of<00:05:57.540> those

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
a perfect world I like both of those

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.990 
a perfect world I like both of those
products<00:05:58.050> better<00:05:58.200> than<00:05:58.440> this<00:05:58.590> so<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.790> not

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
products better than this so it's not

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.730 
products better than this so it's not
horrible<00:06:00.420> but<00:06:00.720> it's<00:06:01.290> just<00:06:01.470> not<00:06:01.620> as
