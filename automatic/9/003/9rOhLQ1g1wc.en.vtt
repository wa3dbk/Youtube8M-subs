00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.349
 st 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.470
 regardless of the outcome of the after 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.140
 we want to play on victory we want 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 bring top performance 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 that's our goal this year and if you can 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 but then do it with high 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.730
 Probability of that is me 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.820
 then convinced the victory and the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.820
 table management 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.500
 of course the table situation speaks 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.059
 the language the balinger as a favorite 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.410
 applies 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.910
 but i just say that every game 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.750
 we have to play well on each one 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 fall something with life 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.909
 the first 25 minutes 30 minutes man 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.409
 from our point of view very good we 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.279
 have had the game totally under control 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:25.269
 were technically tactical speed 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:27.459
 was hugely superior to right 2 0 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:29.080
 the third must do this 

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.659
 We do not have to postpone it 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.369
 made 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:36.580
 lost concentration we have 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:39.999
 important elements lost the game is 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.629
 Tilted the half time have us new 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:45.429
 were trying again in 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.159
 the initial phase we come in 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:50.169
 did not make it second half 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.599
 that was that was a bolzplatz 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.490
 mentality but with structured 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.649
 I had nothing to do with football 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.360
 my audience will be the ginsheim 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:01.689
 certainly a lot of fun yes but I have 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.729
 me so we have the game between 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.729
 minute 30 45 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.150
 I am not satisfied with my beginning 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.340
 our goal was always to speak 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.700
 that one does not use empty hands 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.750
 want to drive away 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.520
 I think the first 20 minutes were too 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:31.210
 anxious but maybe too much 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.820
 Respect for the enemy and have so 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.430
 a bit lost our game 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.280
 but luckily returned and me 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:44.290
 think after that was quite 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.360
 wild boar over the standards and me 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.530
 Actually, the team can only go there 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.730
 make a compliment that they are this time 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.590
 not broken down as in lÃ¶rrach 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.870
 brombach that they have the against 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.330
 Do not think that we are playing with the game now 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.520
 hopefully everybody got it today as well 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.590
 what you have to bring to get now too 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.590
 to compete against balingen 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.030
 which also take with now the next 

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.170
 hard game in reinheim and i am 

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.130
 confident that the team 

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:16.360
 continues to work and grow together 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.360
