00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.660
 Enea's Hello Tales of Symphonia 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.959
 I am a member of the field who is a caster for the Knights of Ratatosk 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.999
 It means to 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.029
 That drama cd for that point 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.099
 To 2 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.460
 It's on the water, it's a macho but it's a board 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.509
 Let me know 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.509
 Also the atmosphere is this drama cd 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.599
 -What 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.579
 atmosphere 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.979
 Eniwa, it's almost the same. 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.980
 There are two sides of that 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is a little bit usually 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.450
 It is difficult to hear what you are saying 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.500
 Behaving and being suspicious 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.750
 that 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.440
 But I feel a little bit more emotional in battle 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.680
 To the end 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.300
 It is not the influence of Dylan, but with difficult processing places 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 I don't really appreciate your wording 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.050
 About the character 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 Also during the recording of d &amp; m 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.710
 That same thing that I take separately 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.110
 I was in the beginning, but I had a group 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.820
 I say that you go by action alternately 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.469
 In feeling 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.310
 That change I can record that way that way 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.410
 I will take it for a long time 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.820
 This time, eco-friendly day. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.620
 The fear that it will be a memorial again 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.130
 I felt like it was difficult 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.430
 body 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 Though it is coil this tales series of recent years 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.000
 Actually I will play that too 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.620
 It's a pity that I'm throwing it on 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.280
 Always 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.240
 It is called subprime or you are looking for itself 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.360
 Things like getting an item or something 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 I am so passionate 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620
 Yeah 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.790
 Good luck without raising POW level too much 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.730
 Aso Foreign Minister always put on without face 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.270
 I'm doing the same series, but I just spend it now 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 It is not public because it is absolutely impossible 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.029
 You and I will release by all means at the shore of the school 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.559
 Next time 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.899
 Takami Kinkai 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.829
 sent macbookair 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.459
 That really until you beat 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.419
 I want to do my best 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.109
 I want to change without giving up without screeching 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.129
 That's how it feels like a book with a smile, I 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.629
 I've been raised together and it's 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.089
 To the last 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.089
 It is with me 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.329
 Thank you
