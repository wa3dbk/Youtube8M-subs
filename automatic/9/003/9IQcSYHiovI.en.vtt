00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
to help make it they might consider

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.040 
to help make it they might consider
trying<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.170> another<00:03:12.950> option<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:14.239> they're

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
trying it another option is if they're

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.470 
trying it another option is if they're
afraid<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.410> green<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.430> add<00:03:16.640> maybe

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
afraid of green you can add maybe

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.910 
afraid of green you can add maybe
blueberries<00:03:18.170> or<00:03:18.200> blackberries<00:03:18.440> or

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
blueberries or blackberries or

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.589 
blueberries or blackberries or
raspberries<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.209> makes<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.540> a

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
raspberries and then it makes it a

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.229 
raspberries and then it makes it a
darker<00:03:20.930> color<00:03:21.140> not<00:03:21.349> green<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.860> maybe<00:03:22.239> it

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
darker color not green so maybe it

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.360 
darker color not green so maybe it
wouldn't<00:03:23.480> look<00:03:23.569> it's<00:03:23.780> scary<00:03:24.110> but<00:03:24.680> once<00:03:25.099> you
