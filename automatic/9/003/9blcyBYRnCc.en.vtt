pounds<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> torque<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:39.020> don't<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pounds of torque I don't know that to be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.020 
pounds of torque I don't know that to be
true<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.250> yet<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> reason<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.399> did<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
true or not yet the reason we did it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.049 
true or not yet the reason we did it
this<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.930> i<00:00:46.520> have<00:00:47.520> another<00:00:47.789> dyno

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this way is because i have another dyno

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.260 
this way is because i have another dyno
pool<00:00:48.450> coming<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.739> i<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.239> all

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
pool coming up and i think we are all

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.029 
pool coming up and i think we are all
kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> interested<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
kind of interested to see if this is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of interested to see if this is
just<00:00:53.070> true<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:53.910> not<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:56.070> some<00:00:56.100> friends

just true or not I have some friends
that<00:00:56.640> actually<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> dyno<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.879> it's<00:00:59.879> going

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that actually have a dyno and it's going

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520 
that actually have a dyno and it's going
to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.149> interesting<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.199> people

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to be interesting to see if these people

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.880 
to be interesting to see if these people
are<00:01:02.840> full<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.769> does

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
are full of or if it really does

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
are full of or if it really does
work<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:08.210> know<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.330> also<00:01:09.479> claim<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
work I know they also claim that it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.679 
work I know they also claim that it's
going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> put<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.500> better<00:01:10.740> spark<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
going to put out better spark which is

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
going to put out better spark which is
obvious<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.299> factory<00:01:16.110> coil<00:01:17.100> packs<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> believe

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
obvious the factory coil packs I believe

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.499 
obvious the factory coil packs I believe
are<00:01:18.049> 20,000<00:01:19.049> volts<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.330> these<00:01:21.450> are

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
are 20,000 volts and I think these are

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
are 20,000 volts and I think these are
somewheres<00:01:22.049> between<00:01:23.540> 30<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> 38<00:01:25.590> thousand

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
somewheres between 30 and 38 thousand

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.240 
somewheres between 30 and 38 thousand
and<00:01:26.340> 40,000<00:01:27.240> volts<00:01:28.040> somewhere<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.159> area

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and 40,000 volts somewhere in that area

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.719 
and 40,000 volts somewhere in that area
I<00:01:29.790> don't<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> could<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.450> wrong<00:01:30.829> but<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:32.640> about

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I don't I could be wrong but we're about

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.390 
I don't I could be wrong but we're about
to<00:01:32.820> find<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:34.710> couple<00:01:34.740> days<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to find out in a couple days when this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.440 
to find out in a couple days when this
thing<00:01:35.460> goes<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:35.939> we're<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
thing goes back up we're going to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.830 
thing goes back up we're going to
actually<00:01:36.829> put<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> dyno<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
actually put it back up on the dyno and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually put it back up on the dyno and
rerun<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.159> then<00:01:41.159> after<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> course<00:01:42.000> the

rerun it then after that of course the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.010 
rerun it then after that of course the
intake<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.700> her<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:46.409> Ford<00:01:46.710> Racing

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
intake manifold and throttle body will

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
intake manifold and throttle body will
be<00:01:50.820> put<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.740> we'll<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.310> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
be put up and then we'll be right in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300 
be put up and then we'll be right in
time<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.689> supercharger<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.310> we're

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
time for supercharger and then we're

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
time for supercharger and then we're
just<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> dress<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.060> new<00:01:57.780> cam<00:01:58.020> covers

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just going to dress it up new cam covers

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
just going to dress it up new cam covers
and<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> forth<00:02:01.189> there's<00:02:02.189> strut<00:02:02.369> tower<00:02:02.579> brace

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and so forth there's strut tower brace

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.649 
and so forth there's strut tower brace
is<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.210> its<00:02:03.360> way

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
is on its way

some of my friends are aware about but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.410 
some of my friends are aware about but
we'll<00:02:17.830> see<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:18.129> happens<00:02:18.280> hopefully<00:02:19.239> this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
we'll see what happens hopefully this

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
guys know about the horsepower but I I

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.619 
guys know about the horsepower but I I
kind<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.250> think<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.450> say

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
kind of think it's but will say
