00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
haven't you think about it and therefore

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
haven't you think about it and therefore
it<00:01:35.009> becomes<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it becomes you know but I think about it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.940 
it becomes you know but I think about it
I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> things<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.740> probably

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I think one of the things that probably

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.270 
I think one of the things that probably
sealed<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> deal<00:01:38.810> she<00:01:39.810> talked<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.280> love

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
sealed the deal she talked about love

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520 
sealed the deal she talked about love
self-love<00:01:41.850> love<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> others<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.170> also

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
self-love love of others and also

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.920 
self-love love of others and also
self-confidence<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:45.090> beauty<00:01:45.450> product

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
self-confidence and how beauty product

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.319 
self-confidence and how beauty product
should<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.649> tap<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
should really tap into those things and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.160 
should really tap into those things and
I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.750> us<00:01:49.759> that's<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.930> beauty

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I think for us that's what the beauty

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.270 
I think for us that's what the beauty
industry<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.070> just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
