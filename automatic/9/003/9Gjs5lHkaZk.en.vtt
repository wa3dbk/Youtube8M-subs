okay<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:01.800> with<00:00:02.010> master<00:00:02.580> assembler

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay we're here with master assembler

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay we're here with master assembler
Rin<00:00:03.149> Smith<00:00:03.540> it's<00:00:04.080> gonna<00:00:04.200> tell<00:00:04.470> us<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.710> the

Rin Smith it's gonna tell us about the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.560 
Rin Smith it's gonna tell us about the
hex<00:00:05.160> blade<00:00:05.870> all<00:00:06.870> right<00:00:08.120> basically<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> got

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
hex blade all right basically what I got

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.270 
hex blade all right basically what I got
here<00:00:09.929> first<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.679> all<00:00:11.150> Stormlord<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:13.280> like

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
here first of all Stormlord and like

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.310 
here first of all Stormlord and like
Shawn's<00:00:14.610> been<00:00:14.880> saying<00:00:15.210> i<00:00:15.570> want<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
Shawn's been saying i want the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.570 
Shawn's been saying i want the
magnetizable<00:00:17.220> thing<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.029> uh<00:00:18.949> here<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:19.980> go<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
magnetizable thing so uh here we go it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.300 
magnetizable thing so uh here we go it
would<00:00:20.730> make<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.720> six<00:00:22.199> variants<00:00:22.890> yes

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
would make it make all six variants yes

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330 
would make it make all six variants yes
I<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.840> all<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.380> magnetize<00:00:26.130> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I first of all got these magnetize that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.900 
I first of all got these magnetize that
standard<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.449> always<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.050> right

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
standard here we always do that right

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.530 
standard here we always do that right
take<00:00:29.910> those<00:00:30.090> off<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:32.030> first<00:00:33.030> thing<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> had

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
take those off for you first thing I had

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.830 
take those off for you first thing I had
to<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.200> had<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> figure<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
to do was I had to figure out how to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
to do was I had to figure out how to
make<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.140> thing<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> move<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
make this thing so it can move back and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.830 
make this thing so it can move back and
forth<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> stuff<00:00:39.090> yeah<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.480> first<00:00:39.660> things

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
forth and stuff yeah the first things

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.990 
forth and stuff yeah the first things
first<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.500> magnetized<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.309> because

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
first these are magnetized here because

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.729 
first these are magnetized here because
they<00:00:42.719> don't<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.140> anything<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
they don't go on anything but the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.060 
they don't go on anything but the
Stormlord<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.500> fit<00:00:46.770> quite<00:00:47.010> nicely

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
Stormlord right so they fit quite nicely

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.119 
Stormlord right so they fit quite nicely
in<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.110> is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.469> everything<00:00:49.890> stays

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
in there and is the everything stays

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.600 
in there and is the everything stays
here<00:00:50.430> okay<00:00:50.969> great<00:00:53.539> okay<00:00:55.219> maintained<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.399> peace

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
here okay great okay maintained in peace

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
here okay great okay maintained in peace
this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> magnet<00:00:57.629> test<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> comes<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this is a magnet test so that comes in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.930 
this is a magnet test so that comes in
and<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.719> there<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:02.340> main<00:01:02.640> piece

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and out there we got this main piece

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.500 
and out there we got this main piece
that<00:01:03.629> comes<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.970> does<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> piece

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that comes off and so does this piece

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.350 
that comes off and so does this piece
here<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.470> need<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.920> swap<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> between

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
here because you need to swap it between

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.039 
here because you need to swap it between
this<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.850> according<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> got

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
this and this according to what you got

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
this and this according to what you got
here<00:01:13.260> sometimes<00:01:14.010> it'll<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.760> sometimes

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
here sometimes it'll be here sometimes

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
here sometimes it'll be here sometimes
we'll<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:16.280> really<00:01:18.530> okay<00:01:19.530> okay<00:01:19.950> so

we'll be there really okay okay so
what's<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> matter<00:01:22.790> okay<00:01:24.530> next<00:01:25.530> variant<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
what's the matter okay next variant we

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.550 
what's the matter okay next variant we
will<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.650> okay<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.950> here's<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.520> variance

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
will do is okay so here's the variance

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.910 
will do is okay so here's the variance
so<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.130> saw<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.990> Stormlord<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
