00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello this is going to be the first of the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.979
 seven videos that we're going to be talking about 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.950
 how to lose weight using the power of 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.820
 the subconscious mind the first thing that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 you are going to do is the following you are going to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.740
 meditate you are going to sit down to rotger in your 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 bed and let's try to relax 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 meditate and start analyzing what is the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.509
 true reason why you 're up 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 of weight where it all started I want that 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.760
 do an inspection of yourself of your 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.840
 I want to send you to the past 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 when I was 5 years old 8 years old 10 years old 15 20 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.080
 and that you start to see it go back and 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.220
 analyze what happened 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.610
 truly what was it that made you 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.070
 eat too much where I started your momentum 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 Bone because a lot of things come for 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.810
 events or events that we 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 they marked and which they made us eat not 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.710
 classes are generated then try 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 remember to meditate 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.360
 I remember to deliver from the past to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.590
 present all the facts and mark them in 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.159
 a pen thinks it made you 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.100
 once you have done that and you have already 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.079
 several points and you realize what was it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 what marked you and what made you eat 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.420
 too much because it's always because of a drama 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.659
 a pressure a memory now I want that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.990
 meditate again and again try 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.929
 think then I want you to see what 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 are the benefits of being fat iu and 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.679
 what are the benefits of being 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:40.099

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 better not doing better self - esteem 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.579
 people should fit better clothes than 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.310
 is better with yourself and obviously in 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.470
 as you see the benefits are on board or 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.210
 gained weight you will realize that they are not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.100
 diseases brings diseases to you 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.039
 people do not see you well some you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.640
 enamored enamored maybe sometimes not you 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.040
 beautiful advantages and disadvantages of being 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.920
 fat and be thin then you have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.319
 a container of ideas which are going 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 traveled to the past meditating and knows what 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.280
 that's what happened and now they see the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.500
 benefits of being thin to be 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 fat then you do not have any 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.750
 separate list then I want you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
 reflections in your meditation and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.390
 Reflections again if you're up 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 that were what made you eat reflects 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.349
 everyday 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.329
 reflection in your meditation what is it that 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.189
 makes you gain weight I know that if 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.340
 perhaps they are the junk food 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.650
 soda or perhaps in meals 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.209

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.060
 be why because they gain weight 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.319
