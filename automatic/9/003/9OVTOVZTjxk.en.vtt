00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.740
 see you there the colors only I think 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.620
 as I said in the last texture on 10 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 and will favor those who make pixel art 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.660
 because things will be well cleaned where 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.390
 It's really cool, what have I done here? 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.730

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 I want to know what you think of the water. 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 Something half-sweet and crystalline I do not know 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 I think there're so transparent but 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.229
 I think it's cool, is not it? 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.780
 Do you want to know what you think about water? 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.060

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.240
 do you want 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.330
 It's good, but I want to know which picture 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.250
 You want it and the most voted I'm going to do it. 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.690

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.220
 I also went back and spoke for her boyfriend. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.460

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.570

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.150
 clay block with cocaine you see 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.670
 animation and the little mouth of Kleiman 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.070
 placing side you see I O 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.380
 That was really cool. It was really fun. 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.560
 I'm very realistic because that's the clay 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.880
 It's really right, and we did it here. 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:00.660

 it gets cool in the dark made it to 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.260
 water also that we did the water I think 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.900
 which was very nice with the rivers of water 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.820
 crystal pure water seemed appears the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.400
 waters of fernando de noronha every year 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.740
 but it really does not look like this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.250
 for sport 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:46.440
