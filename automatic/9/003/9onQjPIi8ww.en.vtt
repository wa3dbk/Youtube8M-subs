00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
been tainted by the void the you know

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.390 
been tainted by the void the you know
her<00:05:00.900> pet<00:05:01.080> wouldn't<00:05:01.410> really<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:02.070> sea<00:05:02.280> or

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
her pet wouldn't really like sea or

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.790 
her pet wouldn't really like sea or
anything<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:02.940> lots<00:05:03.180> about<00:05:03.300> stuff<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.020> then<00:05:04.770> a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
anything so lots about stuff and then a

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.880 
anything so lots about stuff and then a
big<00:05:05.130> void<00:05:05.430> Lord<00:05:05.790> came<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.420> while<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.770> know

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
big void Lord came and while you know

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.920 
big void Lord came and while you know
voids<00:05:08.430> tend<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:08.730> be<00:05:08.820> complete<00:05:09.150> dicks<00:05:09.420> and<00:05:09.720> this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
voids tend to be complete dicks and this

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:40.480 
voids tend to be complete dicks and this
one<00:05:10.140> was<00:05:10.350> well<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> bit<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.670> complete<00:05:12.000> dick

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.999 

so<00:05:41.490> after<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.180> happens<00:05:42.629> there's<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.080> mystery

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
so after that happens there's a mystery

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.559 
so after that happens there's a mystery
that<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.250> need<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.460> go<00:05:44.610> to<00:05:44.669> in<00:05:45.030> shadow<00:05:45.389> moon

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
that you need to go to in shadow moon

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.050 
that you need to go to in shadow moon
valley<00:05:45.780> however<00:05:46.289> there's<00:05:47.009> a<00:05:47.099> specific<00:05:47.370> dagger

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
valley however there's a specific dagger

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.089 
valley however there's a specific dagger
inside<00:05:48.569> that<00:05:48.780> tree<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.199> you<00:05:49.319> can<00:05:49.470> only<00:05:49.710> see

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
inside that tree that you can only see

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.529 
inside that tree that you can only see
if<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.370> have<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.669> item<00:05:51.000> called<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.300> void

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
if you have this item called a void

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.570 
if you have this item called a void
Lantern<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.680> next<00:05:52.830> thing<00:05:52.979> that<00:05:53.099> I<00:05:53.250> did<00:05:53.310> as

Lantern so the next thing that I did as
I<00:05:53.669> went<00:05:53.909> and<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.330> got<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.750> void<00:05:54.900> Lantern<00:05:55.349> this

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
I went and I got the void Lantern this

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.710 
I went and I got the void Lantern this
void<00:05:56.039> Lantern<00:05:56.430> was<00:05:56.639> obtained<00:05:57.090> from<00:05:57.210> one<00:05:57.599> of

void<00:06:15.030> Lantern<00:06:15.419> i<00:06:15.539> went<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.110> tree<00:06:16.560> now<00:06:17.190> once

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
void Lantern i went to the tree now once

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.459 
void Lantern i went to the tree now once
you<00:06:17.969> use<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.300> toilet<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:18.900> you<00:06:18.990> can<00:06:19.139> see<00:06:19.319> this

you use the toilet and you can see this
little<00:06:19.680> tiger<00:06:20.250> thingy<00:06:20.490> that's<00:06:20.669> inside<00:06:21.060> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
little tiger thingy that's inside the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.790 
little tiger thingy that's inside the
tree<00:06:21.389> so<00:06:21.900> upon<00:06:22.110> clicking<00:06:22.289> that<00:06:22.590> you're

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
tree so upon clicking that you're

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.409 
tree so upon clicking that you're
transferring<00:06:23.250> into<00:06:23.460> this<00:06:23.580> void<00:06:23.819> realm<00:06:24.090> thing

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
transferring into this void realm thing

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.689 
transferring into this void realm thing
and<00:06:24.629> you<00:06:24.960> can<00:06:25.110> see<00:06:25.349> a<00:06:25.379> bunch<00:06:25.740> of<00:06:26.069> these<00:06:26.340> big

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699

and you can see a bunch of these big
void<00:06:27.030> Lord<00:06:27.360> mobs<00:06:27.569> I've<00:06:28.020> got<00:06:28.259> to<00:06:28.289> say<00:06:28.530> it<00:06:28.620> was<00:06:28.740> a

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
void Lord mobs I've got to say it was a

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.619 
void Lord mobs I've got to say it was a
really<00:06:29.219> impressive<00:06:29.460> sight<00:06:29.940> just<00:06:30.210> seeing<00:06:30.479> them

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
really impressive sight just seeing them

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.869 
really impressive sight just seeing them
all<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.199> that<00:06:31.469> was<00:06:31.590> certainly<00:06:31.770> nice<00:06:32.069> now<00:06:32.699> after

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
all so that was certainly nice now after

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.180 
all so that was certainly nice now after
killing<00:06:33.389> I'd<00:06:33.810> say<00:06:34.050> about<00:06:34.080> eight<00:06:34.530> of<00:06:34.710> those<00:06:34.889> I

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
killing I'd say about eight of those I

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.550 
killing I'd say about eight of those I
then<00:06:35.759> managed<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.360> get<00:06:36.539> Sam<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.110> void<00:06:37.259> Lord

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
then managed to get Sam the void Lord

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.439 
then managed to get Sam the void Lord
who<00:06:37.710> was<00:06:37.860> of<00:06:38.219> course<00:06:38.400> the<00:06:38.580> boy<00:06:38.699> who<00:06:39.060> popped<00:06:39.270> up

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
who was of course the boy who popped up

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.080 
who was of course the boy who popped up
earlier<00:06:39.810> to<00:06:40.199> appear<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.770> then<00:06:41.400> I<00:06:41.460> killed<00:06:41.849> him

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
earlier to appear and then I killed him

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.510 
earlier to appear and then I killed him
which<00:06:42.389> actually<00:06:42.750> was<00:06:43.080> very<00:06:43.469> easy<00:06:43.860> maybe<00:06:44.340> they

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
which actually was very easy maybe they

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.830 
which actually was very easy maybe they
could<00:06:44.669> buff<00:06:44.819> that<00:06:45.029> up<00:06:45.150> a<00:06:45.240> little<00:06:45.419> bit<00:06:45.690> because

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
could buff that up a little bit because

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.080 
could buff that up a little bit because
Jean<00:06:46.289> was<00:06:46.860> actually<00:06:47.219> easier<00:06:47.580> than<00:06:47.639> the<00:06:47.880> mobs

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
Jean was actually easier than the mobs

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.959 
Jean was actually easier than the mobs
that<00:06:48.240> I<00:06:48.389> killed<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:48.990> get<00:06:49.349> him<00:06:49.590> to<00:06:49.800> spawn<00:06:50.190> a<00:06:50.460> bit

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:50.969 
that I killed to get him to spawn a bit

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.980 
that I killed to get him to spawn a bit
