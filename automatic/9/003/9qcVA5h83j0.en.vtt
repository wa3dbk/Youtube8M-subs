00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
one block the whole tree will fall down

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.250 
one block the whole tree will fall down
and<00:01:00.699> let<00:01:01.699> me<00:01:02.000> demonstrate<00:01:02.119> it<00:01:02.540> it<00:01:02.900> doesn't

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
and let me demonstrate it it doesn't

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.550 
and let me demonstrate it it doesn't
matter<00:01:03.409> if<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.680> use<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:04.640> stone<00:01:05.479> iron<00:01:05.840> Diamont

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
matter if you use a stone iron Diamont

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.030 
matter if you use a stone iron Diamont
or<00:01:06.680> whatever<00:01:07.070> axe<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:09.020> doesn't<00:01:09.350> matter<00:01:09.740> on

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
or whatever axe and it doesn't matter on

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.030 
or whatever axe and it doesn't matter on
what<00:01:10.280> tree<00:01:10.880> o'clock<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:11.510> either<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.860> I'm

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
what tree o'clock it is either so I'm

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.890 
what tree o'clock it is either so I'm
yeah<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.940> when<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.410> chop<00:01:15.410> down<00:01:15.530> one<00:01:15.830> tree<00:01:16.430> block

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
yeah so when I chop down one tree block

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.780 
yeah so when I chop down one tree block
the<00:01:17.900> whole<00:01:18.110> tree<00:01:18.470> will<00:01:18.620> come<00:01:18.800> down<00:01:18.980> and<00:01:19.250> the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
the whole tree will come down and the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.820 
the whole tree will come down and the
same<00:01:19.970> with<00:01:20.210> my<00:01:20.360> iron<00:01:20.620> axe<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:23.350> also<00:01:24.350> same<00:01:24.650> with

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
same with my iron axe and also same with

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.620 
same with my iron axe and also same with
my<00:01:24.980> diamond<00:01:25.190> axe<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.760> this<00:01:25.880> is<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.120> nice<00:01:26.330> long

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
my diamond axe and this is a nice long

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.660 
my diamond axe and this is a nice long
one<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.560> always<00:01:27.890> had<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.370> lot<00:01:28.430> of

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
one and then I have always had a lot of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.210 
one and then I have always had a lot of
trouble<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.060> getting<00:01:29.360> these<00:01:30.050> wood<00:01:30.770> from<00:01:31.010> these

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
trouble of getting these wood from these

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.340 
trouble of getting these wood from these
pine<00:01:31.490> trees<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:32.510> they're<00:01:32.660> so<00:01:32.840> long<00:01:33.050> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
pine trees because they're so long and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.610 
pine trees because they're so long and
no<00:01:34.310> more<00:01:34.550> dirt<00:01:34.850> towers<00:01:35.270> need<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.320> chop

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
no more dirt towers need it so just chop

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.160 
no more dirt towers need it so just chop
down<00:01:36.800> one<00:01:37.010> block<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:38.210> whole<00:01:38.390> tree<00:01:38.840> fall

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
down one block and a whole tree fall

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.290 
down one block and a whole tree fall
down<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.360> useful<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.380> cool

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
down so that is really useful and cool

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.470 
down so that is really useful and cool
now<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.540> my<00:01:44.659> previous<00:01:44.900> video<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:46.480> new

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
now on my previous video in this new

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.090 
now on my previous video in this new
snapshot<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.020> Minecraft<00:01:48.500> someone<00:01:48.860> said

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
snapshot of Minecraft someone said

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.880 
snapshot of Minecraft someone said
jungle<00:01:50.090> biome<00:01:50.270> plus<00:01:50.720> tree<00:01:51.080> capitate<00:01:51.620> er<00:01:51.650> or

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
jungle biome plus tree capitate er or

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.750 
jungle biome plus tree capitate er or
timber<00:01:52.430> equals<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.060> root<00:01:53.330> for<00:01:53.690> 500<00:01:54.260> years<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
timber equals to root for 500 years and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.550 
timber equals to root for 500 years and
I<00:01:55.760> thought<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.479> would<00:01:56.600> be<00:01:56.720> nice<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.290> try<00:01:57.440> that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
I thought it would be nice to try that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.820 
I thought it would be nice to try that
out<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.070> let's<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.670> main<00:01:58.820> menu<00:01:59.000> and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
out so let's go to the main menu and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.920 
out so let's go to the main menu and
what<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:01.159> done<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:01.760> went<00:02:02.450> into<00:02:02.659> the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
what I have done is that I went into the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.410 
what I have done is that I went into the
snapshot<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.680> generated<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.880> world<00:02:05.120> with<00:02:05.390> a

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
snapshot I generated a world with a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.360 
snapshot I generated a world with a
jungle<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.290> then<00:02:06.500> place<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.070> file

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
jungle in it and then place that file
