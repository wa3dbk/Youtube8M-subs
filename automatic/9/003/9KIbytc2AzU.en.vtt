00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:37.819 
has a car candy first two cups of water
and<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.110> you<00:00:25.500> add<00:00:25.770> six<00:00:26.070> cups<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.610> sugar<00:00:36.829> here

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and then you add six cups of sugar here

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
and then you add six cups of sugar here
six<00:00:38.219> cups<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.850> put<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.050> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
six cups and now I'm going to put it on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.639 
six cups and now I'm going to put it on
a<00:00:43.110> boil<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.129> dissolve<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.870> sugar<00:00:45.899> into<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
a boil to dissolve the sugar into the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:01:07.300 
a boil to dissolve the sugar into the
water<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.940> add<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> cup<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
water now I'm gonna add a cup of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:45.190 
water now I'm gonna add a cup of
grenadine<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.840> flavor<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> color

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.380 

and<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.710> we're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> pour<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.150> solution

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and now we're going to pour the solution

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.860 
and now we're going to pour the solution
into<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:50.190> yard<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:51.240> might<00:01:51.450> require<00:01:51.810> some

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
into that yard you might require some

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:03.030 
into that yard you might require some
help<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.920> hot

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.870 

and<00:02:04.900> now<00:02:05.900> we<00:02:06.070> put<00:02:07.070> duct<00:02:07.400> tape<00:02:07.549> over<00:02:09.160> our<00:02:10.160> jar

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and now we put duct tape over our jar

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.320 
and now we put duct tape over our jar
with<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.240> spoon<00:02:11.690> inside<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.610> now<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:14.209> are

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
with the spoon inside and now we are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:39.400 
with the spoon inside and now we are
going<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.959> stick

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.920 

except<00:02:40.280> don't<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:40.820> them<00:02:41.030> touch<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.510> bottom

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
except don't let them touch the bottom

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.910 
except don't let them touch the bottom
or<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.320> edges

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.160 

I'll<00:02:47.370> put<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> coffee<00:02:48.720> filter<00:02:50.450> over<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.810> top

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
I'll put a coffee filter over the top

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.030 
I'll put a coffee filter over the top
through<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.060> check<00:02:54.060> from<00:02:54.690> dust<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.740> earth

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
through the check from dust and earth

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.339 
through the check from dust and earth
getting<00:02:56.550> inside

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
getting inside

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.220 
getting inside
your<00:03:00.310> first<00:03:01.310> experiment<00:03:01.790> generals<00:03:02.510> didn't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
your first experiment generals didn't

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.209 
your first experiment generals didn't
work<00:03:03.499> so<00:03:04.269> now<00:03:05.269> we're<00:03:05.959> leaving<00:03:06.049> up<00:03:06.319> grandi<00:03:06.950> and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
work so now we're leaving up grandi and

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.720 
work so now we're leaving up grandi and
putting<00:03:07.639> a<00:03:07.999> few<00:03:08.299> drops<00:03:09.189> of<00:03:10.189> green<00:03:10.670> food

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
putting a few drops of green food

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:23.300 
putting a few drops of green food
coloring

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.910 

and<00:03:23.790> activate<00:03:24.360> three<00:03:24.630> cups<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.140> sugar<00:03:25.410> one<00:03:25.890> cup

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and activate three cups of sugar one cup

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.500 
and activate three cups of sugar one cup
water

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.039 

we<00:03:29.780> next<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:30.950> more<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.519> this<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.510> put<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
we next up more of this and put the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:48.160 
we next up more of this and put the
crystals<00:03:33.500> back<00:03:33.739> in<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.220> five<00:03:34.430> more<00:03:34.640> days

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.740 

in<00:03:49.170> conclusion<00:03:49.710> the<00:03:50.400> first<00:03:50.750> experiment

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
in conclusion the first experiment

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.180 
in conclusion the first experiment
didn't<00:03:52.200> work<00:03:52.850> as<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.060> can<00:03:54.270> see<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:55.440> fix<00:03:56.040> I

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
didn't work as you can see this fix I

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.720 
didn't work as you can see this fix I
still<00:03:56.490> in<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> jar<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:58.280> still<00:03:59.280> rocks

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
still in the jar and it's still rocks

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.560 
still in the jar and it's still rocks
older<00:04:00.060> than<00:04:00.510> his<00:04:00.660> room<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:02.209> even<00:04:03.209> if<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.390> dip

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
older than his room and even if you dip

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.600 
older than his room and even if you dip
it<00:04:03.690> upside<00:04:04.050> down<00:04:04.080> or<00:04:04.440> something<00:04:04.680> what<00:04:08.300> is

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
it upside down or something what is

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:22.580 
it upside down or something what is
success<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:19.519> think<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:21.030> added<00:04:21.560> way<00:04:22.560> too

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
success and I think we added way too

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:38.660 
success and I think we added way too
much<00:04:22.919> burn<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:28.560> still<00:04:28.800> made<00:04:28.950> supper<00:04:29.190> dad
