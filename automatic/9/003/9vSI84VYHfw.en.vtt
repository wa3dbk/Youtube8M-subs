00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
time for a lot of things so be gentle

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.540 
time for a lot of things so be gentle
because<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:20.110> really<00:01:20.890> didn't<00:01:21.159> know<00:01:21.190> what<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.430> was

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
because I really didn't know what I was

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.880 
because I really didn't know what I was
doing<00:01:21.790> but<00:01:22.000> um<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.080> think<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.470> turned<00:01:23.710> out

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
doing but um I think it turned out

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.280 
doing but um I think it turned out
pretty<00:01:24.070> well<00:01:24.250> um<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:25.150> think<00:01:25.510> I<00:01:25.750> might<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.080> some

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
pretty well um I think I might do some

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.840 
pretty well um I think I might do some
in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> future<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.130> well<00:01:27.310> like<00:01:27.640> we<00:01:27.760> were

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
in the future as well like we were

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.790 
in the future as well like we were
talking<00:01:28.180> about<00:01:28.300> um<00:01:28.659> hey<00:01:28.990> who<00:01:29.020> probably<00:01:29.440> do

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
talking about um hey who probably do

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.380 
talking about um hey who probably do
like<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.040> whole<00:01:30.160> cake<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:30.850> was<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:31.000> spawning

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
like a whole cake that was a spawning

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420 
like a whole cake that was a spawning
pool<00:01:31.690> or<00:01:31.870> something<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.710> think<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.340> would

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
pool or something and I think that would

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.750 
pool or something and I think that would
be<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.610> really<00:01:33.760> cool<00:01:34.030> idea<00:01:34.180> um<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:36.100> yeah<00:01:36.340> if<00:01:36.610> you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
be a really cool idea um but yeah if you

the<00:02:29.140> fondant<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> prepare<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.099> beforehand<00:02:30.610> was

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the fondant to prepare it beforehand was

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.440 
the fondant to prepare it beforehand was
obviously<00:02:31.060> color<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:32.319> add<00:02:32.620> some

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
obviously color and then add some

I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:33.959> called<00:02:34.110> cellar<00:02:34.440> gender<00:02:35.069> or

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
I think it's called cellar gender or

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.880 
I think it's called cellar gender or
tylose<00:02:35.730> depending<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.239> where<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.450> buy<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.890> but

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
tylose depending on where you buy it but

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.860 
tylose depending on where you buy it but
all<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.160> does<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.760> use<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.180> making<00:02:39.660> sort

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
all it does they use it for making sort

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.089 
all it does they use it for making sort
of<00:02:39.930> sugar<00:02:40.140> flowers<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.650> all<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
of sugar flowers and all that kind of

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.270 
of sugar flowers and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.780> makes<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.709> fondant

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
stuff it makes it so that the fondant

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.710 
stuff it makes it so that the fondant
will<00:02:44.370> harden<00:02:44.730> when<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.970> leave<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.330> air<00:02:45.480> dry

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
will harden when you leave it to air dry

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.199 
will harden when you leave it to air dry
rather<00:02:46.080> than<00:02:46.349> going<00:02:46.650> all<00:02:46.920> blobby<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.849> falling

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
rather than going all blobby and falling

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.309 
rather than going all blobby and falling
apart<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> did<00:02:50.610> was<00:02:51.120> basically<00:02:51.720> sit

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and try and get the basic shade down as

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.390 
and try and get the basic shade down as
best<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.760> could<00:02:57.380> any<00:02:58.380> parts<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.920> look<00:02:59.099> like

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.099 
of that and then let it dry enough to go
hard<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:56.910> i<00:03:56.940> could<00:03:57.180> handle<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.600> later<00:03:57.810> all

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
hard so i could handle it later all

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.099 
hard so i could handle it later all
right<00:03:58.319> now<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:58.709> time<00:03:58.980> for<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.310> minerals<00:04:00.109> all

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
right now it's time for the minerals all

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.680 
right now it's time for the minerals all
I<00:04:01.170> did<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.100> minerals<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.730> use<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> basic

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
I did for the minerals was use a basic

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.690 
I did for the minerals was use a basic
sugar<00:04:04.200> glass<00:04:04.380> recipe<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.160> can<00:04:05.310> find<00:04:05.489> them

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
sugar glass recipe and you can find them

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.640 
sugar glass recipe and you can find them
all<00:04:06.030> over<00:04:06.090> YouTube<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.079> I'll<00:04:07.170> try<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.440> find

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
want to put one in the downbar make a

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.930 
want to put one in the downbar make a
sheet<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.709> but<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.100> made<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.489> blue

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
sheet of that but I made it blue

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.229 
sheet of that but I made it blue
obviously<00:04:12.660> possess<00:04:12.959> Bradley<00:04:13.319> um<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.400> then

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
obviously possess Bradley um and then

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.420 
obviously possess Bradley um and then
smashed<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:15.989> into<00:04:16.349> tiny<00:04:16.620> pieces<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
smashed it up into tiny pieces for the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.909 
smashed it up into tiny pieces for the
minerals<00:04:17.970> um<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:19.320> tried<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.709> make<00:04:19.889> sure

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
minerals um I just tried to make sure

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.820 
minerals um I just tried to make sure
that<00:04:20.579> i<00:04:20.609> got<00:04:20.880> them<00:04:21.060> relatively<00:04:21.810> even<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.470> size

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
that i got them relatively even in size

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.100 
that i got them relatively even in size
and<00:04:23.310> about<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.669> right<00:04:23.820> scale<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.630> can't<00:04:24.900> do

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
and about the right scale you can't do

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.810 
and about the right scale you can't do
anything<00:04:25.139> with<00:04:25.710> giant<00:04:26.130> child's<00:04:26.550> if<00:04:26.669> they're

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
anything with giant child's if they're

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.089 
anything with giant child's if they're
trying<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.210> tiny<00:04:27.450> tiny<00:04:27.750> minerals<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.349> just

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
trying to be tiny tiny minerals so just

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.580 
trying to be tiny tiny minerals so just
make<00:04:29.310> sure<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.639> try<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:29.940> cut<00:04:30.090> them<00:04:30.240> into

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
make sure you try and cut them into

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.740 
make sure you try and cut them into
relatively<00:04:31.590> even<00:04:32.010> pieces<00:04:32.220> alrighty<00:04:33.060> now<00:04:33.389> for

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
relatively even pieces alrighty now for

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.110 
relatively even pieces alrighty now for
the<00:04:33.840> creep<00:04:34.229> all<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.770> did<00:04:35.099> was<00:04:35.130> take<00:04:35.460> some<00:04:35.729> purple

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
the creep all I did was take some purple

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.300 
the creep all I did was take some purple
fondant<00:04:36.330> and

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
to roll out the fondant into a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.430 
to roll out the fondant into a
reasonably<00:04:43.790> even<00:04:44.240> circle<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.080> don't<00:04:45.230> want<00:04:45.380> it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
reasonably even circle you don't want it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.770 
reasonably even circle you don't want it
to<00:04:45.590> even<00:04:45.980> because<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.460> know<00:04:46.580> dougies<00:04:47.510> are<00:04:47.660> all

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
areas that would naturally be slimy so

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.250 
areas that would naturally be slimy so
the<00:05:19.760> creep<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.330> heart<00:05:20.540> torre<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:20.930> kind<00:05:21.170> of

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
the creep the heart torre that kind of

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.400 
the creep the heart torre that kind of
thing<00:05:22.060> this<00:05:23.060> just<00:05:23.300> gives<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.660> tiny<00:05:24.080> tiny

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
thing this just gives it a tiny tiny

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.920 
thing this just gives it a tiny tiny
little<00:05:24.680> bit<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:24.920> shine<00:05:25.100> now<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.610> move<00:05:26.150> on<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
little bit of shine now I move on to the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.830 
little bit of shine now I move on to the
minerals<00:05:27.380> um<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.360> want<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.630> make<00:05:29.780> sure

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
minerals um you just want to make sure

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.080 
minerals um you just want to make sure
that<00:05:30.380> you<00:05:30.710> do<00:05:30.950> have<00:05:31.190> definitely<00:05:31.670> enough<00:05:31.940> room

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
that you do have definitely enough room

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.420 
that you do have definitely enough room
for<00:05:32.480> them<00:05:32.810> because<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.170> put<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.770> few<00:05:34.070> mineral

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
for them because I put a few mineral

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.300 
for them because I put a few mineral
field<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.750> then<00:05:35.960> kind<00:05:36.530> of<00:05:36.710> realize<00:05:36.980> it

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
field in and then kind of realize it

just<00:06:08.810> that<00:06:08.870> little<00:06:09.050> bit<00:06:09.290> so<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.680> blends<00:06:09.950> a<00:06:10.100> bit

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
just that little bit so it blends a bit

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.250 
just that little bit so it blends a bit
easier
