originally going there it was honestly

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
originally going there it was honestly
really<00:00:12.210> difficult<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.980> everything<00:00:14.219> in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
really difficult to get everything in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.910 
really difficult to get everything in
line<00:00:14.670> because<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.839> education<00:00:16.350> major<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
line because I'm an education major and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.939 
line because I'm an education major and
at<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.310> university<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> seek<00:00:18.480> for

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
at my university you have to seek for

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.200 
at my university you have to seek for
specific<00:00:19.949> classes<00:00:20.100> every<00:00:20.730> single<00:00:21.000> semester

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
specific classes every single semester

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.840 
specific classes every single semester
and<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> certain<00:00:22.500> order

and they have to be in a certain order

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.540 
and they have to be in a certain order
so<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.529> really<00:00:25.529> couldn't<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.160> those<00:00:26.279> abroad
