00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:13.410
 he greets the good handymen so here 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:16.730
 a little preview two in guitar amp 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.820
 nature the ti amp why the said huh 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.820
 because he's going to bring in a box of tea 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.949
 that's it then it will come after first 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.199
 let's see what's on it then 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.860
 top in main component in the center 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:43.440
 the little chip a country 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.140
 lm 380 6-1 3-6 that a circuit of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 quite classic amplification you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 find plenty of amp diagrams 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.770
 guitar on the net for this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.100
 composing me personally I have to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 50,1 a diagram that I had found on 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.160
 technique even if it recognizes that a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.410
 forum or where someone had done the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.610
 tandem that is exactly the same 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.539
 principle but that came within a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.070
 tuna box here is the diagram it's me 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.600
 if we at home filmed me on the data it's 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 not top 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 so here I am wrong I had to edit a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.300
 little because the original schema 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 was not precise enough especially he did not 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.940
 did not say so you had to plug the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 jack on the mass is entered in or the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.330
 positive 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.240
 and as a bonus or that's short so there 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.289
 normally this one is complete with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.520
 all the little changes I had 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.720
 add it works not bad 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 it's nice it's relatively easy to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.690
 entrusted to mount a good is a little the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.039
 brothel it's flat prototyping there 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:56.340
 so from the spaghetti point of view 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:02:00.630
 we have a switch on off everything 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.020
 simply we have a diode witnesses 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.860
 ignition needed but suddenly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.840
 god is witness so we will cut because 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.090
 that the phone is not far we have 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.310
 a battery charging socket 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.050
 rechargeable 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.000
 so here is a printer supply 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.310
 that I found a little pot late on 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.190
 to get a viewfinder is limited 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.210
 charging amperage 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.780
 because it's a battery must 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.000
 recharge 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.520
 a few million loses only wayne 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 paulino volt rechargeable a 6 mm jack 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.209
 for the guitar 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.840
 that's good this jack jack and qxc is 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.550
 pretty ugly huh jack 3.5mm for for 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.510
 fold also for mp3 player 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.050
 walkman everything you want a 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.940
 knob for gain to be able to do 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.690
 a bit of saturation actually it 's 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.940
 coltan a little saturated and a knob of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.230
 volume 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.459
 here you will notice that it is not 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.739
 they are not the same knob then 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.620
 that I ordered the same late 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.060
 and of course an output speakers that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.280
 is currently connected to a small 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.819
 two satellite speaker hi chains 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.170
 veiled veiled fi salon I will 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.860
 do a little demo to show you 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.860
 how are we? 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.579
 in 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.470
 years 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
 good 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 spend 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.610
 no 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.650
 ban 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.050
 all 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.390
 Oh 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.070
 all 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.070
 e 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.370
 that's about what it gives then 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.949
 we can put a little more gains if 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.360
 we want here we can put a little more 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.259
 of volume until it goes into 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.259
 loop alone as a big 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.919
 we are cut off with a lot of good 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.919
 no room arrives 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.199
 here is an amp of 1 watt 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.150
 it's pretty cool the sound is pretty 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.970
 powerful go I'm done a little 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.760
 demo with the mp3 here is with a 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.780
 good jack input that actually plug on 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.990
 a hi-fi system and that the high 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:21.440
 disabled speakers that's gone for a 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:24.290
 little test even be a little meat 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.979
 without it saturates too much I come from 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.979
 tampered with the threads 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.639
 here is now I must 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.999
 put in the tea box but it takes 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.199
 that I find another speakers of 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.599
 2 cars because I'm here on 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.759
 wanted in brittany to spend 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:48.439
 froze a bit more towards is and to very 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.439
 soon for the tyrant can finish
