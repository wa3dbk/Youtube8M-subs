00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.650 

today<00:00:17.920> we<00:00:18.550> are<00:00:18.820> trying<00:00:19.150> to<00:00:19.210> teach<00:00:19.420> the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
today we are trying to teach the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.380 
today we are trying to teach the
students<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:20.200> differences<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:21.099> can<00:00:22.090> occur

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
students the differences that can occur

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.330 
students the differences that can occur
whenever<00:00:22.660> you<00:00:22.930> just<00:00:23.140> use<00:00:23.349> different<00:00:23.830> types<00:00:24.189> of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
whenever you just use different types of

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.320 
whenever you just use different types of
wood<00:00:25.330> used<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.500> apply<00:00:26.890> smoke<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> meat<00:00:27.760> and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
wood used to apply smoke to the meat and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.880 
wood used to apply smoke to the meat and
so<00:00:28.539> this<00:00:28.840> week<00:00:29.050> we're<00:00:29.289> actually<00:00:29.440> using

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
so this week we're actually using

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.000 
so this week we're actually using
chicken<00:00:30.850> thighs<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.510> we<00:00:32.199> didn't<00:00:32.529> season<00:00:32.890> them

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
chicken thighs and we didn't season them

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.000 
chicken thighs and we didn't season them
at<00:00:33.160> all<00:00:33.309> no<00:00:33.699> salt<00:00:34.030> no<00:00:34.150> pepper<00:00:34.300> no<00:00:35.260> seasoning<00:00:35.830> so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
at all no salt no pepper no seasoning so

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.229 
at all no salt no pepper no seasoning so
that<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.250> students<00:00:36.610> could<00:00:36.730> really<00:00:36.879> pick<00:00:37.210> up

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
that the students could really pick up

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.630 
that the students could really pick up
on<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:38.199> different<00:00:38.710> flavorings<00:00:39.190> that<00:00:39.489> the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
on the different flavorings that the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.400 
on the different flavorings that the
smoke<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:39.910> actually<00:00:40.449> giving<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.870> meat<00:00:41.050> itself

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
smoke is actually giving the meat itself

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.979 
smoke is actually giving the meat itself
and<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:42.400> we're<00:00:42.610> using<00:00:42.850> several<00:00:43.600> different

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
and so we're using several different

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.369 
and so we're using several different
woods<00:00:44.199> we're<00:00:44.920> using<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.370> pecan<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.989> all<00:00:47.229> of

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
woods we're using a pecan and all of

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.960 
woods we're using a pecan and all of
these<00:00:47.530> four<00:00:47.979> woods<00:00:48.220> that<00:00:48.370> we're<00:00:48.519> using<00:00:48.699> today

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
these four woods that we're using today

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.660 
these four woods that we're using today
are<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.390> four<00:00:49.629> main<00:00:49.870> ones<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.589> find<00:00:50.949> in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
are the four main ones that you find in

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.460 
are the four main ones that you find in
the<00:00:51.820> state<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.059> Texas<00:00:52.629> so<00:00:52.960> we<00:00:53.110> have<00:00:53.260> pecan

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
the state of Texas so we have pecan

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.130 
the state of Texas so we have pecan
which<00:00:54.220> is<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.400> little<00:00:54.729> bit<00:00:54.850> softer<00:00:55.330> wood<00:00:55.540> and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
which is a little bit softer wood and

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.759 
which is a little bit softer wood and
then<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.500> also<00:00:56.680> have<00:00:58.140> Mesquite<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.350> this<00:00:59.559> is<00:00:59.739> a

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
then we also have Mesquite and this is a

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.700 
then we also have Mesquite and this is a
very<00:01:00.100> popular<00:01:00.430> wood<00:01:00.850> mainly<00:01:01.449> because<00:01:01.629> it's<00:01:02.229> so

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
very popular wood mainly because it's so

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.250

obviously the fruit woods have different
kinds<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.410> flavors<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:23.489> Texas<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.420> four

kinds of flavors in Texas the four
common<00:02:25.709> woods<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.150> use<00:02:27.450> quite<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> bit

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
common woods that we see use quite a bit

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.000 
common woods that we see use quite a bit
or<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> hickory<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.820> ski<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.510> pecan<00:02:31.500> and

or a hickory and the ski and pecan and
oak<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> lot<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.910> depends<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.420> what

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
oak and a lot of that depends on what

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.510 
oak and a lot of that depends on what
part<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.140> state<00:02:34.380> you're<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.310> those

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
part of the state you're in but those

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.890 
part of the state you're in but those
would<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.850> kind<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> big<00:02:36.390> four<00:02:36.690> word<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
would be kind of the big four word that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660 
would be kind of the big four word that
you<00:02:37.050> would<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.980> nice<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you would see the nice thing that you

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.460 
you would see the nice thing that you
have<00:02:38.850> today<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.840> actually<00:02:40.020> get

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
have today is that you can actually get

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.520 
have today is that you can actually get
the<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.760> wood<00:02:42.030> even<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.810> chips<00:02:43.170> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the the wood even in little chips is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.430 
the the wood even in little chips is
that<00:02:43.800> come<00:02:44.160> prepackaged<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.660> those<00:02:46.170> are

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that come prepackaged and so those are

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860 
that come prepackaged and so those are
very<00:02:46.680> easy<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:47.100> find<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.450> things<00:02:48.660> that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
very easy to find and so one things that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
very easy to find and so one things that
you<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.380> build<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.680> fire<00:02:49.890> with

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you can do you build a fire with

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.020 
you can do you build a fire with
charcoal<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:51.989> put<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.680> chips<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.670> there

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
charcoal and then put the chips on there

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.840 
charcoal and then put the chips on there
some<00:02:54.750> people<00:02:55.080> say<00:02:55.260> wet<00:02:55.680> them<00:02:55.950> down<00:02:55.980> before<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
some people say wet them down before you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.820 
some people say wet them down before you
put<00:02:56.880> -<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.540> smoke<00:02:57.780> more<00:02:57.989> I've<00:02:58.320> read<00:02:58.620> -

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
put - a little smoke more I've read -

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.199 
put - a little smoke more I've read -
others<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.640> put<00:03:00.000> them<00:03:00.090> on

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
others have just they just put them on

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.820 
others have just they just put them on
there<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> smoke<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> comes<00:03:01.530> from

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
there but it's a smoke that comes from

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740 
there but it's a smoke that comes from
that<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.700> always<00:03:02.970> important<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.420> put<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
that it's always important to put the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.350 
that it's always important to put the
smoke<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.380> early<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> cooking<00:03:05.519> process<00:03:05.850> as

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
smoke on early in the cooking process as

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.410 
smoke on early in the cooking process as
the<00:03:06.930> meat<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.610> starting<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> cook<00:03:08.820> because

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the meat is starting to cook because

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.199 
the meat is starting to cook because
it'll<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:09.870> impart<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.650> smoke

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
it'll really impart the smoke

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.150 
it'll really impart the smoke
characteristics<00:03:12.209> lot<00:03:12.450> more<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.799> are<00:03:13.950> some

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
characteristics lot more there are some

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.370 
characteristics lot more there are some
kinds<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.820> woods<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.450> Mesquite<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.290> are

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
kinds of woods like Mesquite that are

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.990 
kinds of woods like Mesquite that are
very<00:03:16.560> strong<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.310> have<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.640> careful

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
very strong so you have to be careful

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.880 
very strong so you have to be careful
about<00:03:18.060> how<00:03:18.329> much<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.930> might<00:03:19.079> use<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.380> for

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
about how much you might use that for

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.100 
about how much you might use that for
people<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.340> will<00:03:20.489> talk

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
people that will talk

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.050 
people that will talk
that's<00:03:21.650> really<00:03:21.980> good<00:03:22.130> for<00:03:22.310> using<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.700> short

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
that's really good for using a short

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.390 
that's really good for using a short
cooking<00:03:23.330> process<00:03:24.050> versus<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.560> longer<00:03:25.130> time

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
cooking process versus a longer time

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.900 
cooking process versus a longer time
because<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:26.000> might<00:03:26.030> get<00:03:26.450> an<00:03:27.020> even<00:03:27.350> stronger

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
because you might get an even stronger

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.400 
because you might get an even stronger
you<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.270> universal<00:03:29.930> wood<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
you know the universal wood that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.020 
you know the universal wood that
probably<00:03:30.740> is<00:03:30.890> well<00:03:31.100> love<00:03:31.340> its<00:03:31.580> Hickory

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
probably is well love its Hickory

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.570 
probably is well love its Hickory
because<00:03:32.600> it's<00:03:32.900> got<00:03:33.050> such<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.320> great<00:03:33.680> flavor<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
because it's got such a great flavor to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.820 
because it's got such a great flavor to
it<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.330> again<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.750> Texas<00:03:36.170> we'd<00:03:36.350> see<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> lot<00:03:36.620> of

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
it but again in Texas we'd see a lot of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.250 
it but again in Texas we'd see a lot of
oak<00:03:36.980> use<00:03:37.340> especially<00:03:38.300> in<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.780> Central<00:03:39.110> Texas

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
oak use especially in the Central Texas

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.130 
oak use especially in the Central Texas
barbecue<00:03:39.950> places<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.910> again<00:03:41.390> get<00:03:41.900> further

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
barbecue places and again get further

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.440 
barbecue places and again get further
west<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.800> you'll<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:43.160> places<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.150> raise<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
west and you'll see places that raise a

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.260 
west and you'll see places that raise a
lot<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.840> cons<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.560> lot<00:03:46.040> more<00:03:46.280> pecan<00:03:46.640> wood<00:03:46.940> baby

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
lot of cons a lot more pecan wood baby

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.930 
lot of cons a lot more pecan wood baby
is<00:03:47.780> there<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.100> week<00:03:49.340> we<00:03:49.520> did<00:03:49.700> chicken

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
is there so this week we did chicken

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.760 
is there so this week we did chicken
thighs<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.630> was<00:03:50.720> all<00:03:50.900> about<00:03:51.020> showing<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
thighs and it was all about showing the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.560 
thighs and it was all about showing the
students<00:03:52.160> how<00:03:52.370> different<00:03:52.880> woods<00:03:53.300> could

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
students how different woods could

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.600 
students how different woods could
affect<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.080> flavor<00:03:54.350> based<00:03:54.830> off<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.340> smoke

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
affect the flavor based off of the smoke

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.030 
affect the flavor based off of the smoke
that<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:55.940> gave<00:03:56.120> off<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.500> week<00:03:57.740> we

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
that it gave off so this week we

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.040 
that it gave off so this week we
actually<00:03:58.160> had<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.760> very<00:03:58.790> very<00:03:59.390> close<00:03:59.750> race

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
actually had a very very close race

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.470 
actually had a very very close race
between<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.590> four<00:04:00.830> woods<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:01.910> use<00:04:02.180> and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
between the four woods that we use and

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.320 
between the four woods that we use and
our<00:04:03.260> top<00:04:03.590> one<00:04:03.830> actually<00:04:04.190> was<00:04:04.340> mesquite<00:04:04.880> which

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
our top one actually was mesquite which

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.590 
our top one actually was mesquite which
is<00:04:05.770> kind<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:06.860> indicative<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.550> how<00:04:07.760> often<00:04:08.450> it's

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
is kind of indicative of how often it's

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.680 
is kind of indicative of how often it's
used<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.890> barbecue<00:04:10.250> industry<00:04:11.090> in<00:04:11.209> Texas<00:04:11.360> in

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
used in barbecue industry in Texas in

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.660 
used in barbecue industry in Texas in
general<00:04:11.990> because<00:04:12.320> it's<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:12.709> prevalent<00:04:13.160> across

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
general because it's so prevalent across

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.810 
general because it's so prevalent across
the<00:04:13.910> state<00:04:14.300> both<00:04:15.290> by<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.160> was<00:04:16.340> hickory<00:04:16.790> and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
the state both by that was hickory and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.340 
the state both by that was hickory and
oak<00:04:17.090> which<00:04:17.540> were<00:04:17.810> actually<00:04:18.140> tied

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
oak which were actually tied

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.860 
oak which were actually tied
both<00:04:21.160> we're<00:04:21.790> very<00:04:22.000> close<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.570> mesquite

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
both we're very close to the mesquite

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.960 
both we're very close to the mesquite
actually<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.530> just<00:04:23.979> didn't<00:04:24.400> quite<00:04:24.580> receive

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
actually but just didn't quite receive

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the same number of votes but it's very

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.719 
the same number of votes but it's very
neck-and-neck<00:04:27.400> race<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.810> pecan<00:04:29.199> was<00:04:29.410> last

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
they didn't feel like the flavor was

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.210 
they didn't feel like the flavor was
good<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:38.080> may<00:04:38.199> have<00:04:38.289> been<00:04:38.380> too<00:04:38.590> strong<00:04:38.650> for

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
good it may have been too strong for

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.550 
good it may have been too strong for
them<00:04:39.340> that<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.970> pecan<00:04:40.300> was<00:04:40.560> definitely

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
them that the pecan was definitely

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.890 
them that the pecan was definitely
darker<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.130> appearance<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:43.419> it<00:04:43.509> shows<00:04:43.720> us

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
darker and appearance and it shows us

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.360 
darker and appearance and it shows us
that<00:04:43.930> there's<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.289> lot<00:04:44.440> more<00:04:44.620> smoke<00:04:44.919> on<00:04:45.130> those

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
that there's a lot more smoke on those

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.969 
that there's a lot more smoke on those
thighs<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:47.380> would<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.590> given<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.860> a

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
thighs and that would have given it a

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.189 
thighs and that would have given it a
different<00:04:48.310> flavor<00:04:48.550> profile<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.990> lot<00:04:50.169> of

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
different flavor profile and a lot of

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.550 
different flavor profile and a lot of
people<00:04:50.470> didn't<00:04:50.740> find<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.190> up<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.520> know
