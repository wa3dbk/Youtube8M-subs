00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 Italian guys once you enter 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.120
 inside you will obviously find the screen 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 of titan folk a content game 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890

 etc. March 13 and titan is the beta like 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.129
 you can see he put you an arrow 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.909
 on beta build you have to create them 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.950
 in the beta 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.509
 obviously another page will open that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.240
 will take you to how to participate 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.070
 at the draw the draw will be 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 exclusive exclusive of course of pc e 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 xbox one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.719
 then of course select yours 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 peripheral if you have pc without that pc if 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.020
 you have xbox once in a box one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.549
 obviously for the 360 it was not 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.319
 released because surely this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.479
 game was developed entirely for 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.179
 next gen and then will also be released on 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.679
 three 60, however, on day one all 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.389
 games and the official release of the game 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.909
 select the peripheral vault 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.429
 select if you will select pc in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.499
 In this case , this screen will appear 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.119
 where you will need to fill in e-mail addresses and 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.609
 origin password that you surely have 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.459
 for games and i so builders of 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.770
 remember the password remedy ring so 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.229
 you don't have to do the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.639
 registration to log in again 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.329

 this is the screen for xbox instead 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.819

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.889

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.219
 I would recommend if to remit date 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.709
 birth of adults to be on the safe side 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.479
 no al I agree to share targeted 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.310
 with selected partners you see that it is not 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.540
 obligatory those we say that it is one 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.040
 kind of advertising that ends up 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.989
 in your inbox 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.819
 yes I do mention the privacy policy 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.010
 and terminate self- service because 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.380
 otherwise it does not receive the beta in 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 home you obviously receive it and then 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.740

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.520
 box one 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600
 saddle you will let me know the topics with 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 me because i would like to know that with me the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.500

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.580

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.290
 he cannot even publish it on the channel 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.990
 if I had it because otherwise 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.000
