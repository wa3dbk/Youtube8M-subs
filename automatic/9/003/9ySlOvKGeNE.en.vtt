together and then you basically turn it
like<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:05.119> tab<00:02:06.119> these<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.630> lift<00:02:07.530> those<00:02:07.710> off

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
like that tab these in lift those off

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.559 
like that tab these in lift those off
that<00:02:08.940> goes<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.860> add<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> over

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
that goes in like that add that over

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.150 
that goes in like that add that over
with<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
with in like that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.010 
with in like that
and<00:02:15.160> then<00:02:16.560> supposed<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:19.630> those<00:02:19.810> two

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
and then supposed to have those two

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.910 
and then supposed to have those two
pieces<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.340> they<00:02:21.459> snap<00:02:21.520> together<00:02:22.739> flip<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
pieces and they snap together flip that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:38.300 
pieces and they snap together flip that
over<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:32.430> okay<00:02:35.340> make<00:02:36.340> sure<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.610> all

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
over and then okay make sure it's all

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.530 
over and then okay make sure it's all
snapped<00:02:39.310> into<00:02:39.610> place<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.860> that's<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.540> 2014

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
snapped into place and that's the 2014

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.990 
snapped into place and that's the 2014
Corvette<00:02:43.840> mode<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.319> got<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.650> all
