00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.279
 remains a nice tackle the audi a4 from the previous generation baker I can too 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.090
 not 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 the numbers 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.949
 I'm ali 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.990
 we would be new ceo ex ceo 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 based on the old the audi a4 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.150
 where provided with the latest techniques and with a new nose and 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
 a new wave 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.640
 the ex a short life with the six engines 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.550
 three gasoline and three diesels 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.550
 these engines are all two-edge 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.090
 and he became powers ranging from 120 because 43 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.590
 and 170 hp 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.680
 At the moment, Webber knew the strongest diesel with 170 hp 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.679
 I have to say 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.679
 it is of course excellent it is the same engine that we know from 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.000
 to train US Army products 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.120
 it is a commercial block no longer the poker stars to Zeeland 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.460
 it was the first win 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.800
 he thinks that is a lot better than the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 to close diesels we knew so far from the PVV 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480
 the driving behavior of the ex ceo is mainly 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.090
 this kind has true and the standard chassis are underneath and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.040
 sports suspension the functional 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.050
 With this you cannot do very much of the road surface 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.510
 the springs and dampers bored region waternet all the way from the asphalt 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.180
 And that ensures that you are actually very comfortable with an ex he on the road 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.090
 can be 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 that is heard 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 admitted that he has a lot of audi a4 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260
 he seems the same 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.590
 he feels the same he sends the same 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.620
 but that does not alter the fact that a lot of modern technology is hidden in this ek 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.520
 7 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.660
 Take the engines that are a lot nicer than in the A4 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.280
 and it is also doing well compared to its competitors 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.340
 if even less is coming onto the market next year 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.580
 and then with a knife from price of 26,000 euros 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.930
 Do you think that once the best pots can break into this business
