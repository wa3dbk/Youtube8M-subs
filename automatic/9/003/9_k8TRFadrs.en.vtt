00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.949
 I bought from this cam I bought 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.660
 This cut table here is very beautiful. 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 My old lady's already starting to say 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.539
 Cascais though they were leaving then 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 every time I made the cut she was 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.219
 rocking make a noise and that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 was bothering me and I found this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.190
 beautiful model 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.699

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 she had commented that she had bought 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 there and I went there and bought the green 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 I think it's beautiful, I bought this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.520
 large and bought small because when 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.590
 I was at the time I went and did not have all 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 they a bigger size so I bought 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.159
 two big ones and the others I bought one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 smaller size 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.479
 so I went shopping now 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 I recently heard that they had 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.770
 resources and you had to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.229
 other granddaughter pink colors her pink 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.390
 A kiss is even fierce. 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.569
 Thank you for the tip and I bought a blue one. 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.240
 crazy for a blue and those bodies them 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.900

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.840
 good price for quality by model I 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.670
 I found very beautiful and there also had 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 put some bowls on sale I was 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.600
 crazy to buy some glasses in that tone 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.690
 both 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.480
 and I think it was something the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.010
 my leprosy was a fee in that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.170
 tom and then I bought this here and I am 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.630
 showing a single piece to not stay 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
 showing everything but I usually buy 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.380
 the amount needed for places 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.340

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.920
 unless I find neither the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
 how much I need there body 6 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 or if I like it too much if I have four 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.430
 I buy the units and the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.440
 four and it does not matter then when I 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.209
 I came when I received only four people myself 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.450
 I set the table according to the quantity 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.570
 of parts that I have but this one 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.959
 was also in the supermarket big good and he 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.420
 It cost 7 and 90 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.130
 there at the big supermarket comes 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 I bought these small bowl sac156 is 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.799
 My name is the small frog I think it is 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.180
 written here I bought the hopscotch 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.820
 I bought orange and bought the brown and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.090
 tied up I also took a little bit 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.420
 bigger than 8 was this one here and 6 and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.180
 little bit of this little shop in a store called 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.519
 cassol here in santa catarina also she 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.070
 has variety is home that has products 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.959
 home has products for the home to 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.299
 construction already showed you 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.130
 some things I bought there if not 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:55.070
 I was mistaken in the final purchases of 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:04:00.890
 and I found this support is not 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03.200
 Sport is supporting the bait in the eta 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.130
 writing on the shelf was written 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.690
 that this here was pan rest 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.069
 people but whats not shocking panela 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.799
 Look, the size of this here is very large. 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.289
 and then I had the idea that's how I 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.229
 I have put it for when to make a 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.280
 a snack table that the dishes are 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.830
 minors 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.590
 are dessert dishes I had the idea 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.919
 to buy them to exactly put 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.979
 how to overcome the dessert plate then 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:37.229
 I brought the round and brought the square 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.169
 I have square plate too and 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.389
 I have round dishes and high school on the hour 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.849
 measure because because there it is also 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.849
 cassol centerlar then she has products 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.310
 For everything, it's home, like I said before. 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.349
 Then I got a plate. 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.560
 a dessert plate is square 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.289
 I put it up here and it was perfect and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.509
 this one is also a round dish 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.639
 dessert also fits perfectly 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:05.220
 even made a video showing 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.680
 a table set when I made a cookie 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.660
 and found the table to be cute and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.910
 decides to film to show how 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.449
 had stayed and I put this board 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.460
 here it is actually written that he 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.830
 It's pan rest but I found that 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.599
 it fit and fit perfectly for 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.620
 some the board 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:30.810
 I came across the camera for some a priest and a 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.060
 snack table to close I bought 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.220
 now in the gardening part I bought 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.800
 in a store called spring garden here 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.889
 shows in florianÃ³polis 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.039
 and I bought these two masi serve 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:51.169
 coconut fiber 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:51.169
 I bought this small and this giant 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.009
 were I think this one was 26 if I 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.789
 I'm not mistaken 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.409
 and this one was something like that 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.710
 I also wanted to show this stool. 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.830
 I did not buy this stool here. 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.250
 I gained from the joinery of the boy who 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.949
 made the furniture here from my kitchen and the 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.360
 From my bedroom I showed a video of 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.510
 shopping I bought a stool in 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.700
 tok stok and this stool would be for 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.830
 use here one more 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.530
 the car was not ready I finished 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.990
 leaving him there my closet and finished 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.480
 being so useful that I stayed internal 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.260
 Then bring it to my side of my room. 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.850
 here 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.410
 So I talked to the boy that the 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.410
 bank option exactly to be able to 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.050
 climb up and reach for the closet that will stay 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.450
 very tall and then he made that stool 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.430
 For me it did not charge me anything and it stays 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.920
 embedded here in the property 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.490
 here in my kitchen it also looked good 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.100
 cute and perfect for leaving 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.250

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.290
