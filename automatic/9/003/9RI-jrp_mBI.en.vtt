we're going to build on good consistent

as you're hitting keep good clearance
over<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.329> net<00:00:47.890> getting<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.979> ball<00:00:49.159> up<00:00:49.190> higher

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
over the net getting the ball up higher

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.149

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.920 

you<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.340> use<00:01:00.489> underspin<00:01:01.449> as<00:01:01.660> well<00:01:02.260> as<00:01:02.469> topspin

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you can use underspin as well as topspin

one<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.110> best<00:01:05.320> ways<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.590> practice<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.430> is

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
one of the best ways to practice this is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.450 
one of the best ways to practice this is
to<00:01:07.119> have<00:01:07.270> one<00:01:07.510> player<00:01:07.780> hit<00:01:08.110> top<00:01:08.380> spin<00:01:08.460> while

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
to have one player hit top spin while

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.480 
to have one player hit top spin while
the<00:01:09.640> other<00:01:09.820> person<00:01:10.119> picks<00:01:10.479> slice<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:12.220> after

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
the other person picks slice then after

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.110 
the other person picks slice then after
a<00:01:12.520> few<00:01:12.700> moments<00:01:12.990> switch<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.140> up

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.270 

movement<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.570> important<00:01:20.170> both<00:01:20.560> up<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.100> back

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
movement is important both up and back

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.899 
movement is important both up and back
as<00:01:21.640> well<00:01:22.300> as<00:01:22.480> side-to-side

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.510 

now<00:01:28.420> up<00:01:28.600> next<00:01:28.630> pulling<00:01:29.409> back<00:01:29.649> and<00:01:30.009> go<00:01:30.280> face

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
now up next pulling back and go face

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.270 
now up next pulling back and go face
line<00:01:30.789> to<00:01:31.000> baseline<00:01:37.710> who's<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.890> handsome<00:01:39.130> guy

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
line to baseline who's that handsome guy

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.249 
line to baseline who's that handsome guy
on<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> court<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:46.390> move<00:01:46.539> back<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.140> go

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
on the court when we move back and go

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.230 
on the court when we move back and go
baseline<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.890> baseline<00:01:47.920> we're<00:01:48.670> adding<00:01:48.970> length

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
baseline to baseline we're adding length

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.679 
baseline to baseline we're adding length

or depth to the court we're working on
good<00:01:58.960> height<00:01:59.259> over<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.619> net<00:01:59.860> which<00:02:00.549> also

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
good height over the net which also

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.760 
good height over the net which also
means<00:02:01.270> good<00:02:01.630> depth<00:02:01.959> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> court<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:04.770> you're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
means good depth in the court as you're

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.449 
means good depth in the court as you're
doing<00:02:05.920> this

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
doing this

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.330 
doing this
don't<00:02:06.700> forget<00:02:07.060> your<00:02:07.299> good<00:02:07.509> footwork<00:02:08.170> as<00:02:08.340> you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
don't forget your good footwork as you

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.640 
don't forget your good footwork as you
can<00:02:09.459> see<00:02:09.640> Stefan<00:02:10.179> does<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> great<00:02:11.110> job<00:02:11.170> of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
can see Stefan does a great job of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.870 
can see Stefan does a great job of
consistently<00:02:12.280> moving<00:02:12.700> his<00:02:12.819> feet

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
consistently moving his feet

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.770 
consistently moving his feet
as<00:02:15.800> we<00:02:16.800> did<00:02:16.950> earlier<00:02:16.980> we're<00:02:17.910> using<00:02:18.180> both

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
as we did earlier we're using both

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.980 
as we did earlier we're using both
topspin<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.650> under<00:02:20.640> span<00:02:23.690> one<00:02:24.690> player<00:02:24.960> can

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
topspin and under span one player can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.610 
topspin and under span one player can
spend<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.500> few<00:02:25.530> moments<00:02:25.800> hitting<00:02:26.250> topspin

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
spend a few moments hitting topspin

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.360 
spend a few moments hitting topspin
while<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> other<00:02:28.920> player<00:02:29.250> hits<00:02:30.000> slice<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
while the other player hits slice one of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.980 
while the other player hits slice one of
the<00:02:32.430> goals<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.240> try<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> hit<00:02:33.720> five

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the goals would be to try to hit five

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.470 
the goals would be to try to hit five
balls<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.560> row<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.920> your<00:02:35.070> partner<00:02:35.480> once

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
balls in a row with your partner once

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
balls in a row with your partner once
you've<00:02:36.660> done<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.860> try<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.340> ten
