back from Los Alamos that we didn't have

something that was common because Los

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.309 
something that was common because Los

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
anything that they didn't feel was

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.110 
anything that they didn't feel was
strange<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.409> it<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.099> combination<00:03:14.909> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
strange so it was the combination of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.439 
strange so it was the combination of
elements<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.900> were<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.189> these<00:03:17.430> objects<00:03:18.150> that

elements that were in these objects that

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.710 
elements that were in these objects that
I<00:03:18.810> think<00:03:19.139> inspired<00:03:19.709> them<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.519> advise<00:03:21.180> us<00:03:21.449> that

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
I think inspired them to advise us that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.559 
I think inspired them to advise us that
more<00:03:21.930> tests<00:03:22.259> should<00:03:22.409> be<00:03:22.470> done<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:24.060> implants

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
more tests should be done the implants

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.479 
more tests should be done the implants
