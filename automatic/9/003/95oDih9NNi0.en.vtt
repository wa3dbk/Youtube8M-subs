00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
everything's been stripped down to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.330 
everything's been stripped down to
little<00:04:12.150> smaller<00:04:12.540> chords<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.410> are<00:04:13.709> moved

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
little smaller chords that are moved

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.770 
little smaller chords that are moved
around<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.730> little<00:04:14.819> bit<00:04:15.000> easier<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.510> don't

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
around a little bit easier you don't

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.539 
around a little bit easier you don't
tend<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.200> use<00:04:16.290> really<00:04:16.680> fifth<00:04:16.979> chords<00:04:17.340> all<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
tend to use really fifth chords all the

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.670 
tend to use really fifth chords all the
time<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.329> this<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.660> definitely<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.320> case<00:04:19.470> with

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
time so this is definitely a case with

time so this is definitely a case with
this<00:04:19.799> song<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.510> here<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.690> again<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.370> you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
notice I'm sliding into the first chord

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 
notice I'm sliding into the first chord
sometimes<00:04:26.520> I'll<00:04:26.669> slide<00:04:26.910> into<00:04:27.150> other<00:04:27.300> ones<00:04:27.540> too

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

can do the same thing so you'll hear me
slide<00:04:45.660> nice<00:04:45.870> sometimes<00:04:46.110> sometimes<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.860> want

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
slide nice sometimes sometimes I want

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.740 
slide nice sometimes sometimes I want
sometimes<00:04:47.430> I'll<00:04:47.789> put<00:04:48.030> muted<00:04:48.270> strums<00:04:48.539> in

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
sometimes I'll put muted strums in

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.180 
sometimes I'll put muted strums in
sometimes<00:04:49.350> I'll<00:04:49.470> leave<00:04:49.590> them<00:04:49.710> out<00:04:49.800> as<00:04:49.919> rest

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
sometimes I'll leave them out as rest

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:03.670 
sometimes I'll leave them out as rest
but<00:04:50.460> but<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> idea<00:04:51.270> okay<00:04:52.190> here<00:04:53.190> goes

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.080 

so<00:05:04.680> slide<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.100> in<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.310> first<00:05:05.610> double<00:05:05.880> stop

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.310 

and<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.240> can<00:05:13.360> just<00:05:13.480> start<00:05:13.630> from<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.900> half<00:05:14.080> step

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
and you can just start from a half step

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.840 
and you can just start from a half step
back<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.620> don't<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.950> be<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.070> big<00:05:15.310> slide<00:05:15.670> to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
back it don't have to be a big slide to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.190 
back it don't have to be a big slide to
where<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.030> hear<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.360> starting<00:05:16.720> point<00:05:16.990> you

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
where you hear the starting point you

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.240 
where you hear the starting point you
really<00:05:17.470> want<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.650> hear<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.830> sound<00:05:18.010> of<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
really want to hear the sound of the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.770 
really want to hear the sound of the
slide<00:05:18.490> at<00:05:18.670> the<00:05:18.700> starting<00:05:19.090> point<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.480> if<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:19.630> do

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
slide at the starting point so if you do

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.600 
slide at the starting point so if you do
this<00:05:19.900> why<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.380> start<00:05:20.740> from<00:05:20.920> maybe<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.460> half

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
this why just start from maybe a half

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.820 
this why just start from maybe a half
step<00:05:21.850> away<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.210> go<00:05:22.330> into<00:05:22.510> it<00:05:22.690> just<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:23.800> that

step away and go into it just so that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.230 
step away and go into it just so that
you<00:05:24.040> hear<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.310> sound<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.670> slide<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.120> not

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
you hear the sound of the slide and not

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:34.470 
you hear the sound of the slide and not
not<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:25.810> starting<00:05:26.110> four<00:05:26.380> okay<00:05:31.020> okay<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.790> in

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
so once again the the double stops and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.140 
so once again the the double stops and
tuned<00:06:01.750> up<00:06:01.870> courts<00:06:02.260> in<00:06:02.410> this<00:06:02.830> lesson<00:06:03.400> are<00:06:03.580> color

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
tuned up courts in this lesson are color

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.690 
tuned up courts in this lesson are color
coded<00:06:04.450> so<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:05.140> can<00:06:05.350> actually<00:06:05.530> see<00:06:06.040> what<00:06:06.310> what

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
coded so you can actually see what what

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.860 
coded so you can actually see what what
the<00:06:06.850> pairs<00:06:07.090> are<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.419> you<00:06:07.480> can<00:06:07.600> just<00:06:07.720> practice

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
the pairs are and you can just practice

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.409 
the pairs are and you can just practice
them<00:06:08.169> individually<00:06:08.710> then<00:06:08.980> as<00:06:09.940> you<00:06:10.240> get

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
them individually then as you get

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.850 
them individually then as you get
familiar<00:06:10.840> with<00:06:11.080> them<00:06:11.320> go<00:06:11.500> ahead<00:06:11.560> and<00:06:11.710> tackle

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
familiar with them go ahead and tackle

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.480 
familiar with them go ahead and tackle
the<00:06:12.070> whole<00:06:12.190> part<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:13.390> have<00:06:14.230> programs<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.160> and

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the whole part I have programs and and

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.830 
the whole part I have programs and and
machines<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:16.030> we<00:06:16.090> use<00:06:16.150> at<00:06:16.390> our<00:06:16.480> school<00:06:16.810> to

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
machines that we use at our school to

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.050 
machines that we use at our school to
slow<00:06:17.260> these<00:06:17.470> parts<00:06:17.830> down<00:06:18.040> to<00:06:18.550> actually<00:06:18.850> play

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
slow these parts down to actually play

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.270 
slow these parts down to actually play
play<00:06:19.690> them<00:06:19.810> without<00:06:19.930> changing<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.770> pitch<00:06:20.950> so

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280
