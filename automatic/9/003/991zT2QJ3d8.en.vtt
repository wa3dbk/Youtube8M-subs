00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.070
 hi all dear friends with you yo 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.469
 life 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.239
 and this video will be about french 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.650
 Fri-Sau 3 levels fcm 36 pak 40 today 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.529
 me a little surprise 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.290
 the thing is, I wrote this one down for you 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.070
 replay of May another computer that's on ultra 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.369
 settings 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.340
 so that among other things you can 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.190
 enjoy a good picture let's start with 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.680
 she is a very pleasant instrument 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.489
 fire rate of almost 16 shots 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.070
 per minute and the damage is 110 units per 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.020
 I shot both armor-piercing and goldovymi 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 shells breaking through 98 grandmother 126 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.200
 gold yes and come down pretty quickly from 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.660
 all this we can conclude that 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.660
 gun especially for the third level 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.369
 very good 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.009
 tanks of her level she turns 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.219
 sewn with fourth scrap of course not all 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.799
 so smooth but about 95 percent of the machines 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.130
 will still be able to harm the badies 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.530
 but with the fives against kv-1 Churchill and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.380
 some more units just 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 necessary gold but generally play with 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.859
 they can most importantly hide well good 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.630
 with disguise she is all very well 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.249
 visibility 400 meters what is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.759
 just incredibly large figure 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:37.639
 for our level on a map like a rally 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.009
 rda or province can be lit in 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.909
 the first seconds of the battle almost all tanks 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.639
 adversary 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.909
 in most cases they don't even immediately 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.429
 notice where they fire from 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.920
 the main problem fcm 36 pak 40 is 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.810
 just disgusting i'm speed capable 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.869
 catch up on me apathy or even 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.299
 Depression I do not like slow tanks 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.399
 until you reach the position can have time 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.499
 kill their opponents and then 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.709
 the only thing left to wait 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:09.890
 the next fight which is possible more 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.399
 lucky but there is another problem this 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.550
 armor 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.190
 up machine gun shots she of course 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.310
 endure but you with other weapons diva 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.080
 things get worse if it happens 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.280
 that they will light you and start shelling 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.580
 from all sides 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.830
 you cannot do anything therefore 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.740
 you need to carefully select the position 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.340
 preferably empty and better 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.620
 double with the fifth level is generally better 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.690
 close ranges do not fight on 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.150
 open cards should look for some 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.790
 elevation and provides as much as possible 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.160
 wider range of shelling on medium 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.110
 or long distance if there is 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.320
 the ability to go after the stone 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.200
 good shot fcm confidently yourself 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.420
 feels on a similar terrain if 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.820
 you hit the city map tactic 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 will differ slightly at first 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.020
 turn you will need to go for 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.420
 allies but try to hold on 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.870
 away from them and opponents play 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.280
 maximum caution and 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.370
 Of course, if you forget 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.370
 use our main plus review well 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.420
 well it's time to take stock 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.070
 I can say about fcm 36 pak 40 in general 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.830
 it's very slow fri-sau 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.210
 speed disgusting but with weapons 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.820
 really tried 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.390
 gun quick damage accurate for 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.460
 a shot of a good review of 400 meters will help 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 we find the enemy almost in 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.840
 the very beginning of the battle provided open 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 cards and you can calmly 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.520
 adjust the damage according to your own light 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.250
 tanks of the third level from several 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.050
 our shots are quickly sent to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.260
 another world about armor 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.200
 the question is very controversial someone says that 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.569
 sturdy olic ricochets no 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.689
 noticed 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.150
 in general, there is someone who thinks the car 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.459
 very good but unfortunately to get 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.219
 it can no longer be transferred to 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.069
 category promotions so this video 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.099
 rather for those who have long bought but not 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.620
 I dare to go into battle with you but was 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.709
 little ice put likes subscribe 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.709
