00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hi i am ari and today our / a guy 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.160
 of higher recommendation that I just 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 finish reading but over font 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.549
 third but good I'll talk to you more 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.670
 or less about what it is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.740
 the first is this that I have here below 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 what are songs for paula 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.890
 and in itself it's like more than anything a guy 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:34.250
 romance but as well as that juvenile one 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.000
 like now music so to speak and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.600
 seriously, it's extremely beautiful, either 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.820
 I loved the first edition and if 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 I see that it's like he has media like that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 like that separation is because he discovers 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.600
 the part is like they have songs or 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.440
 They have quotes that I loved 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 which is in Italian if I'm fine if in 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 Italian and I love it and nothing is 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.280
 in itself it's like the copy is a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.110
 original and if you can be buy 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.960
 the original I did not find it and it was 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.689
 well as they usually need full of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 book and this cost me like caixa 19 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.150
 suns but it cost me 15 soles and what 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.799
 I bought like in the center of Lima the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.430
 they live but I bought it like in a 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.200
 center of lime or lime and the part of the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 back that that songs 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.520
 for paula is a fresh frank novelty and 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.549
 youth that tells the story of one of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.409
 classroom a several between 17 years from 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.440
 in love with angel a boy a little 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 greater wanted 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.610
 with those you know online without 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.190
 But when still great appears 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 alex who only knows in a little while 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.350
 but whose meeting in the cinema also 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.850
 Obviously leaving the new viewpoint and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 is closer since you could expect 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 everything is a mess of loves and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.080
 heartbreakers and all will be and all these 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 your friends will be witnesses and asus not 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.390
 they separate from paula itself I'm like ya 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.340
 he says it from here this basically deals with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.450
 three guys who are in the life of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.000
 paula like that 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.160
 I mean I want but I do not want to count on 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 half the ending because it's like I think 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.890
 what is the suspense so that the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.830
 second but it's seriously spectacular 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.080
 if there is any you gave me like it like that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.360
 like that is where it 's like that means 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.540
 romantic as well as it is 1,900 for 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.700
 a book as it is for you and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 after this like I did not get 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.620
 the book or I did not buy the book 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.110
 as well as that physically I do not 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.739
 they got it virtually and what 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.080
 I have here and it's called you know I love you 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.080
 but I do not have I do not know if I managed to see 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.650
 it's called you know I love you and it 's the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:56.310
 cover of the plane and this one in way 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 virtual has 537 this sheets here is 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.329
 the end and I do not know I love it seriously is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.310
 extremely beautiful if you 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.470
 do you care that you rep 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.970
 understood the first part of the book and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.470
 out there they want to get the second 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.409
 well, it leaves me in the little box 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.209
 comments this they want to make a 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.920
 part and that can send us normal 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.879
 completely free, I'm not going to charge 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 do not worry and because seriously I do not know to 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.930
 I find it much easier to read crazy 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.700
 but you see also like I could not 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.129
 now all parties only to power in 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.439
 my case in some places but it 's 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.170
 extremely half serious though 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.599
 this book I did not like I do not know the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.019
 first book fascinated me this simply 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.720
 I loved it and as I finished a 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.269
 way as well as that but because if it takes 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.590
 waiting for it to end in another way 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.569
 but well I still did not get to the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.120
 third the third book that is 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.989
 plus 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.790
 this street with me a kiss there would be the 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.920
 third still where I still do not 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.680
 I bought and I had it virtually 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.129
 but I got lost I do not know where this is 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.140
 so it will be something to buy it then to 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.010
 see if you guys out there want 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.489
