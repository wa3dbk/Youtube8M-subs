00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
goes really well with the short cut

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.620 
goes really well with the short cut
scenes<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.200> take<00:03:27.380> place<00:03:27.620> with<00:03:27.950> each<00:03:28.100> mouth

now<00:03:29.630> some<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.050> sound<00:03:30.260> effects<00:03:30.620> are<00:03:30.860> little

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
now some of the sound effects are little

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.850 
now some of the sound effects are little
off<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.660> game<00:03:32.870> especially<00:03:33.110> with<00:03:33.740> the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
off in the game especially with the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.790 
off in the game especially with the
shooting<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.400> takes<00:03:34.700> place<00:03:35.140> at<00:03:36.140> times<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
shooting that takes place at times the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.740 
shooting that takes place at times the
controls<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.490> gameplay<00:03:37.730> felt<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.540> they

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
controls and gameplay felt like they

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.510 
controls and gameplay felt like they
could<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:39.050> tightened<00:03:39.620> up<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.220> little<00:03:40.400> bit

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
could be tightened up just a little bit

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.360 
could be tightened up just a little bit
so<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.810> brink<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.590> four<00:03:42.920> character

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
so in brink you have four character

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.520 
so in brink you have four character
classes<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:44.090> choose<00:03:44.120> from<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:45.200> have<00:03:45.350> the

actually<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.989> chance<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.650> switch

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
actually have the chance to switch

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.370 
actually have the chance to switch
between<00:03:55.700> character<00:03:56.480> classes<00:03:56.750> which<00:03:57.200> I
