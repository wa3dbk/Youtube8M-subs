00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
TNT tissue arrow with up in the air in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.279 
TNT tissue arrow with up in the air in
it<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.279> quite<00:00:20.490> cool<00:00:21.000> belt<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:22.109> not

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
it and it's quite cool belt it's not

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
it and it's quite cool belt it's not
very<00:00:22.560> useful<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> honest<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
very useful to be honest it does the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.679 
very useful to be honest it does the
arrows<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.830> hurt<00:00:26.750> monsters<00:00:27.750> yourself<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
arrows can hurt monsters yourself and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.790 
arrows can hurt monsters yourself and
sheep<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.019> pigs<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.920> whatnot<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.800> let's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
sheep and pigs and whatnot but and let's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
sheep and pigs and whatnot but and let's
get<00:00:34.950> started<00:00:35.450> first<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.930> they

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
get started first of all when it they

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.850 
get started first of all when it they
take<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.640> 2<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.510> 3<00:00:40.550> cold<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> I'm

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
take a 2 by 3 cold there and then I'm

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
take a 2 by 3 cold there and then I'm
going<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.260> bucket<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.350> war<00:00:46.940> I'll<00:00:47.940> put<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
going in a bucket of war I'll put it in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
going in a bucket of war I'll put it in
this<00:00:48.750> corner<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.940> use

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this corner and I'm going to use

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
this corner and I'm going to use
redstone<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.940> basically<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.230> redstone

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
redstone and basically this is redstone

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
redstone and basically this is redstone
by<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> doesn't<00:01:00.149> look<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
by the way it and it doesn't look like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760 
by the way it and it doesn't look like
it<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:00.960> different<00:01:01.320> texture<00:01:01.620> pack

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it because I got different texture pack

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.010 
it because I got different texture pack
on<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.280> said<00:01:02.489> before<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:04.439> gonna

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
on like I've said before but I'm gonna

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
on like I've said before but I'm gonna
leave<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> around<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.799> stop<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
leave it around here and stop in the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.760 
leave it around here and stop in the
middle<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> use

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.820 

put<00:01:16.770> down<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> block<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.960> looks<00:01:19.259> really

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
put down a block there it looks really

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
put down a block there it looks really
stupid<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.299> works<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:24.740> I'll<00:01:25.740> put

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
stupid but it works and and I'll put

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
stupid but it works and and I'll put
another<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> I'll<00:01:27.840> use<00:01:28.110> erase<00:01:28.409> one

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
another one there and I'll use erase one

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.330 
another one there and I'll use erase one

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.089 
there are ways in that direction the
direction<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:03.079> which<00:03:03.109> they<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:04.069> very

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
direction in which they go in is very

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.970 
direction in which they go in is very
random<00:03:04.700> they<00:03:05.329> could<00:03:05.629> go<00:03:05.870> straight<00:03:06.560> along

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
random they could go straight along

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.819 
random they could go straight along
there<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.790> straight<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.560> straight<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.739> that

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
there and straight up straight in that

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.309 
there and straight up straight in that
direction<00:03:10.299> just<00:03:11.299> any<00:03:11.569> direction<00:03:11.989> basically

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
direction just any direction basically

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.530 
direction just any direction basically
but<00:03:12.859> it's<00:03:13.370> not<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.790> don't<00:03:13.879> think<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.389> can

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
but it's not I don't think you can

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.420 
but it's not I don't think you can
really<00:03:14.930> control<00:03:15.379> which<00:03:15.859> direction<00:03:16.250> new<00:03:18.430> but

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
really control which direction new but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.180 
really control which direction new but
yeah<00:03:19.669> that's<00:03:19.910> how<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.480> works<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.079> that's<00:03:21.980> how

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
yeah that's how it works and that's how

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.430 
yeah that's how it works and that's how
you<00:03:22.250> build<00:03:22.900> thanks<00:03:23.900> for<00:03:24.049> watching<00:03:24.260> guys<00:03:24.379> and
