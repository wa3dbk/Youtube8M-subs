first of all this headset goes for about

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.529 
first of all this headset goes for about
80<00:00:42.750> US<00:00:43.140> dollars<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.539> 650

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
80 US dollars so that's about like 650

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.779 
80 US dollars so that's about like 650
Hong<00:00:45.809> Kong<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.860> too<00:00:47.070> expensive<00:00:47.100> but

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.770 
getting from the five hb2 was just
incomparable<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:40.040> just<00:04:40.460> felt<00:04:41.150> like<00:04:41.210> both<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
incomparable I I just felt like both the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.440 
incomparable I I just felt like both the
shooting<00:04:42.080> here<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:42.440> there<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:43.040> don't<00:04:43.220> know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
shooting here and there and I don't know

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.680 
shooting here and there and I don't know
where<00:04:44.450> I'm<00:04:44.600> getting<00:04:44.690> shot<00:04:45.110> how<00:04:45.500> I'm<00:04:45.680> dying

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
where I'm getting shot how I'm dying

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.270 
where I'm getting shot how I'm dying
just<00:04:47.690> doesn't<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.380> there<00:04:48.710> are<00:04:48.800> serious

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
just doesn't that there are serious

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.700 
just doesn't that there are serious
aren't<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.820> great<00:04:50.060> pair<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.930> gaming<00:04:51.410> headset

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
aren't a great pair of a gaming headset

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.490 
aren't a great pair of a gaming headset
for<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.920> soundstage<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:53.000> my<00:04:53.780> conclusion<00:04:54.050> is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
for a soundstage so my conclusion is

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.300 
for a soundstage so my conclusion is
just<00:04:55.090> for<00:04:56.090> losing<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.510> both<00:04:56.720> games<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.920> audio

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
just for losing in both games the audio

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.610 
just for losing in both games the audio
is<00:04:58.340> just<00:04:58.760> not<00:04:59.030> as<00:04:59.240> good<00:04:59.390> as<00:04:59.690> Rachel<00:05:00.140> claims<00:05:00.380> it

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
is just not as good as Rachel claims it

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.710 
is just not as good as Rachel claims it
but<00:05:01.220> there<00:05:01.640> are<00:05:01.670> a<00:05:01.790> lot<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> reviews<00:05:02.540> out<00:05:02.660> there

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720

cartas<00:05:49.430> for<00:05:50.030> eighty<00:05:50.450> dollars<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:51.110> don't<00:05:51.710> think

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
cartas for eighty dollars I don't think

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.370 
cartas for eighty dollars I don't think
it's<00:05:52.040> worth<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.310> for<00:05:53.060> fifty<00:05:53.510> dollars<00:05:53.840> yeah<00:05:54.350> I
