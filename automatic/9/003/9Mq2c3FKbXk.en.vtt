00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello to all rugby specialists 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.260
 internet version with a guest 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.420
 exceptional tonight mourad boudjellal 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.070
 good evening good evening president of Toulon and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.960
 so who will answer the questions that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 you drop on the site canalplus.fr or 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.439
 still apply it to the rugby hall 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.460
 lice or the driver hoping 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.060
 rugby you are an informed surfer a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.400
 tweet rise 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 I just went from minitel to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 internet not long ago was the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 last hooked on the minitel or is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.329
 stayed very very very nice for him 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.309
 are there pictures and with the minitel 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.899
 I always liked the Minitel and I 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.430
 am a traditionalist I am disappointed 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 but mourad did not ask as a friend 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.050
 on facebook okay so I'm waiting for that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 but maybe able after the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 rugby specialists this week and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 maybe that is rock berbizier 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.680
 fabien pelous are also there people 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.719
 because the rooms we did not show 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 but of course you have noticed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 with his white fleece first question 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.300
 to the frederic save ch'ti that think 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.739
 you to the idea dear president that the top 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 14 become one day a top 12 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 and are you for or against 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 removing the fascines at the end 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 to award the title to the first of the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 regular phase on the top on the top-12 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.810
 it would be ideal but I think that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 if we want rugby to develop 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.320
 will have to leave room for 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.850
 new cities while retaining 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 historic rugby towns so where from where 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.710
 it's not a lot 14 is not bad 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 that would be better after learning 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.380
 the schedule so because maybe 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.700
 consider moving the year to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.220
 sixty three weeks if it's 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.390
 possible but what if we want the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.829
 rugby grow their calls which 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.270
 we will one day have a great team at 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.100
 Lille to Strasbourg to nant in others 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.540
 big cities but that means so what 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 will be at the expense of historic bastion 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.630
 rugby 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.040
 so we have to find a mix between 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.119
 two 16 is still something 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 that often comes from the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.649
 president of bkc fast what 's 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640
 descent and mount more so that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.990
 is fun anyway at four 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.670
 people in addition and all those who 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 shake before and so it depends on 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 presidents i believe toulouse militates 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 for the 12 championships so some 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 presidents also think reduce 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.119
 I think we should come back 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 international calendar for power 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 then build the French calendar 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.420
 consistent with the European cups the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.399
 international meetings 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.810
 the problem only and treat 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.429
 only the French championship 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.289
 without the constraints of the cuts of europe 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.250
 and and international matches will be 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.300
 always difficult 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.610
 all formulas can defend themselves 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.620
 second sub question in question of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.670
 frédéric saubesty the suppression of 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.840
 final stages in order to award the title 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.880
 at the first of the regular phase 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.980
 no i would not take too much for myself i 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.930
 am happy because even though 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 it seems incredible that the times 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.200
 first be not champion of France I 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.820
 am happy because I find that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.840
 it's the perfume of the final stages it's 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.010
 something exceptional in the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.990
 rugby what and I have memories of 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.870
 kid with with highway areas 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.460
 filled with Toulon fans who 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.260
 were going up to see a final phase match 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.820
 it's our identity it's our 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.370
 adn the final stages rugby and I think 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.200
 than me who am rather a progressive 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.250
 from that point I am an old con what 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 and I find that the final stages 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.500
 this is essential 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.810
 we do not know how old we are trying 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 to be is to be just young people 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.600
 throwing under a train 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 no but it's just being realistic by 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.420
 relation to what must be the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.640
 rugby in society ie that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 where the sport in general events 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.080
 creator of emotions and that's my fact 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.840
 the final stages ccd tip of pride 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.950
 where everything is played on a match over 80m a 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.630
 story that happened that will be in 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.100
 holidays sax bank de france 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 meanwhile which also does not prevent 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.790
 to be used for duplicates we will not be able 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.239
 to do that it's obvious that the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.160
 double it will darken everything so its soft 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.390
 and 14 if we go to 12 it's true he 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.100
 could ask himself the question of his 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.600
 final son since there it would be a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.080
 duplicate and familial with respect to 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.580
 neutral championship neutralize 24 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.560
 days when the teams 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.180
 20 22 days the teams will put 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.739
 their best team or so and to 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.630
 people if they split that they are 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.510
 takes five years with all the content not 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.800
 but here is the man or so consider 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.090
 play several times a week 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.770
 twice a week on some 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.730
 Athens day sources because I 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.560
 think for a coach 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.180
 it's better a situation he's going 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.380
 decide who will lead so he will do 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.630
 turn he will not turn his group 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.700
 rather than a situation that suffers or the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.200
 islands to he has no choice so is this 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.640
 it's not worth thinking about that 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.970
 it's not me it seems to me that I 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.709
 always preferred to handle than to handle 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.920
 what to suffer will be the first maxim the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.030
 evening the second it's a question the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.390
 second question from philippe casas 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.560
 great 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.280
 will it be possible to 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.080
 limit the number of players 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.239
 selectable by club example no 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.980
 more than four per club team 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.669
 France so as not to steal the clubs 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.620
 of their frames and we can do the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.850
 rules at all 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.050
 do all kinds of horrible of course 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.940
 I think it takes in rugby 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.830
 it is to restore a balance between 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.880
 money and knowledge today which 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.470
 is the most important thing is to have 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.510
 money is not having knowledge and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.979
 so we have to restore this balance 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.330
 in particular by ensuring that the 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.979
 training becomes an asset in the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.990
 clubs everything is thought in training 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.210
 for it to be a cost center and 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.380
 not a center profit center and if 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.139
 tomorrow we manage to make sure that the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.560
 training be a real asset for 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.169
 the clubs 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.729
 we will rebalance the championship we are going 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.500
 rebalance the clubs and you will see 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.520
 that collectives of France will wear well 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.879
 better we will not come back this topic that 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.080
 we agree the clock okay we got 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.219
 spoke in the show fell in agreement 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.439
 with me there they seek themselves they do not 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.270
 do not know yet the third question 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.039
 and hleb is long enough it's him that a 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.749
 vessel saone has withheld three questions 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.999
 tonight it's faustine scene that has them 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.979
 retained with arthur bordeaux about 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.639
 the new pcr organization that manages the 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.229
 European rugby 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.669
 from this year a new 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.749
 financial breakdown the establishment 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.029
 which gives pride to the leagues 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.749
 French and English at 33 % 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.580
 earnings 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.319
 but this surfer tells us only 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.330
 in its statutes there is a paragraph that 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.949
 change everything indeed the Celts knew 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.559
 reserve a guaranteed minimum of 20 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.729
 million euros confirmed president 20 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.629
 millions of euros whatever the 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.259
 amount of turnover of the 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.240
 new instance 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.550
 is this true and if so why France 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.259
 would not have done as much but because 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.399
 we needed the Celts for 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.139
 play this cup of europe and then it's 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.119
 is she alone you had in 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.639
 the old configuration so it was 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.719
 difficult to leave otherwise and then 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.430
 we have always sold the project in 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.349
 saying we will go further so we 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.860
 told us grosso modo bavay you go 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:57.599
 you pay on the farthest that you 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.569
 it just seems this amount guaranteed for 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.279
 Celts you who knew rugby 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.110
 Italian pier as a breeder 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:06.389
 nothing that lost who lost a 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.949
 franchise so be careful indeed 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.539
 if we want a real cup europe it 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.519
 still need participants from 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.649
 several countries is the balance to 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.849
 find between two champions strong the 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:17.279
 English championship and championship 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.919
 French and with other participants 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.919
 which are more selections than 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.930
 club teams so that's it's all 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.269
 these differences that are sometimes 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.669
 difficult to put in the same hat 

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:32.999
 to make a consistent competition on 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:36.830
 restart on the competition keith ablow 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:40.130
 consistent when we finished at 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.930
 the other in a definition that took 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.120
 also that they had 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.970
 so I think we'll have to wait 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.250
 another one or two seasons to know 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.780

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.820
