I<00:00:04.670> wanted<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> show<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.000> my<00:00:06.170> current<00:00:07.170> setup

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
I wanted to show you my current setup

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.500 
I wanted to show you my current setup
for<00:00:07.890> 3d<00:00:08.490> using<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.570> two<00:00:09.889> cannon<00:00:11.209> x<00:00:12.209> one

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
for 3d using the two cannon x one

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.450 
for 3d using the two cannon x one
hundredths<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> an<00:00:15.289> optical<00:00:16.289> mount<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
hundredths this is a an optical mount to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
hundredths this is a an optical mount to
go<00:00:17.550> slide<00:00:17.910> mount<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:19.050> allows<00:00:19.679> me<00:00:20.009> to<00:00:21.650> move

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
go slide mount that allows me to move

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.970 
go slide mount that allows me to move
each<00:00:22.859> camera<00:00:23.220> left<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:25.320> control<00:00:25.679> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
each camera left to right to control the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.609 
each camera left to right to control the
separation<00:00:26.910> distance<00:00:27.390> between<00:00:27.839> them<00:00:30.619> it's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
separation distance between them it's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.310 
separation distance between them it's
mounted<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.450> just<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.570> expensive<00:00:35.210> tripod

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
mounted on a just an expensive tripod

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
mounted on a just an expensive tripod
and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.469> add<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:37.829> rubber<00:00:38.280> grip<00:00:38.820> handle

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and I add a little rubber grip handle

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.290 
and I add a little rubber grip handle
right<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.440> lift<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> unit<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
right here so I can lift a unit up and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200 
right here so I can lift a unit up and
get<00:00:42.870> some<00:00:43.020> additional<00:00:43.260> stability<00:00:43.969> from<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
get some additional stability from the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.259 
get some additional stability from the
weight<00:00:45.629> being<00:00:46.379> far<00:00:47.190> down<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.699> you<00:00:47.879> actually

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
weight being far down there you actually

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.509 
weight being far down there you actually
get<00:00:48.420> some<00:00:48.629> pendulum<00:00:49.140> effect<00:00:49.230> stability<00:00:52.519> the

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
get some pendulum effect stability the

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.509 
get some pendulum effect stability the

which<00:00:59.519> came<00:01:00.179> with<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.449> slide<00:01:00.719> mount<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.260> then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
which came with the slide mount and then

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
which came with the slide mount and then
there<00:01:02.100> hasn't<00:01:02.280> there's<00:01:02.730> an<00:01:02.850> offset<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.269> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there hasn't there's an offset that I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280 
there hasn't there's an offset that I
built<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.350> adjust<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.390> toe<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.630> the

two cannon th ones with the display out
I<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.090> eight<00:01:42.450> centimeters

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
I can go about eight centimeters

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.670 
I can go about eight centimeters
separation<00:01:44.550> distance<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.870> do<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> search

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
separation distance if you do a search

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.630 
separation distance if you do a search
for<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:48.510> program<00:01:49.050> called<00:01:49.380> stereo<00:01:49.950> calc<00:01:50.400> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
for a program called stereo calc I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060 
for a program called stereo calc I
believe<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:50.970> called<00:01:51.090> stereo<00:01:51.540> base<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
believe it's called stereo base it's a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
believe it's called stereo base it's a
freeware<00:01:53.430> program<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.360> actually

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
freeware program and it will actually

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.830 
freeware program and it will actually
show<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.250> stereo<00:01:56.640> based<00:01:56.970> calculations

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
show you the stereo based calculations

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.790 
show you the stereo based calculations
that<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.260> need<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:59.070> different<00:02:00.800> subject

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
that you need for different subject

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.460 
that you need for different subject
distances<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.580> background<00:02:03.000> distances<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
distances and background distances and

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.610 
distances and background distances and
it's<00:02:04.710> pretty<00:02:04.860> helpful<00:02:05.220> for<00:02:05.520> doing<00:02:05.760> an<00:02:05.910> eclipse

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's pretty helpful for doing an eclipse

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's pretty helpful for doing an eclipse
again<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:07.800> think<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.190> called<00:02:08.340> stereo<00:02:08.700> base

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
again I think it's called stereo base

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.869 
again I think it's called stereo base
your<00:02:09.149> stereo<00:02:09.420> kalkan<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.229> free<00:02:10.890> simple

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
your stereo kalkan it's free simple

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.479 
your stereo kalkan it's free simple
little<00:02:12.000> program<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:13.469> I<00:02:13.500> did<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:14.069> have

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
little program and what I did is I have

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.950 
little program and what I did is I have
a<00:02:14.519> chart

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a chart

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.250 
a chart
that<00:02:16.770> essentially<00:02:17.540> has<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that essentially has all the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.770 
that essentially has all the
calculations<00:02:19.500> four<00:02:20.220> different<00:02:20.780> subject

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
calculations four different subject

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.260 
calculations four different subject
distances<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.680> background<00:02:23.490> distances<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
distances in background distances and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.940 
distances in background distances and
you<00:02:25.230> plug<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.210> millimeters<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.360> your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you plug in the millimeters of your

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
you plug in the millimeters of your
camera<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.370> 35-millimeter<00:02:30.180> camera<00:02:30.810> or

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
camera a 35-millimeter camera or

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.200 
camera a 35-millimeter camera or
equivalent<00:02:31.830> 35<00:02:32.160> millimeter<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> four<00:02:33.000> defer

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
equivalent 35 millimeter and four defer

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.680 
equivalent 35 millimeter and four defer
the<00:02:33.330> canon<00:02:33.720> TX<00:02:34.050> ones<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.690> 39

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the canon TX ones it's actually 39

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.360 
the canon TX ones it's actually 39
millimeters<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:37.860> plug<00:02:38.130> in

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
millimeters is what you would plug in

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.260 
millimeters is what you would plug in
for<00:02:39.210> your<00:02:39.830> focal<00:02:40.830> length<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.880> camera

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
for your focal length of the camera

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.660 
for your focal length of the camera
that's<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> equivalent<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> TX<00:02:43.560> ones<00:02:43.890> for

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that's the equivalent of the TX ones for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.230 
that's the equivalent of the TX ones for
35<00:02:45.120> millimeter<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:46.590> separation<00:02:47.280> distance<00:02:47.940> or

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
35 millimeter in separation distance or

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.290 
35 millimeter in separation distance or
what<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.780> call<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.230> stereo<00:02:49.590> base<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.910> going

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
what they call the stereo base is going

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.210 
what they call the stereo base is going
to<00:02:51.360> vary<00:02:51.660> from<00:02:51.990> these<00:02:52.500> things<00:02:52.680> being<00:02:52.950> really

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to vary from these things being really

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.260 
to vary from these things being really
close<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.690> display<00:02:55.140> essentially<00:02:56.270> being

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
close with the display essentially being

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.740 
close with the display essentially being
closed<00:02:58.160> here<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.760> where<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> bring<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.600> other

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
closed here and where I bring the other

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.210 
closed here and where I bring the other
Cameron<00:03:01.290> really<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.830> close<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
Cameron really really close like that to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.640 
Cameron really really close like that to
the<00:03:05.640> cameras<00:03:06.090> being<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:06.780> kind<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.170> out

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the cameras being really kind of out

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.680 
the cameras being really kind of out
about<00:03:08.100> 25<00:03:08.670> centimeters<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:14.270> that's<00:03:15.270> 25

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
about 25 centimeters like this that's 25

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.010 
about 25 centimeters like this that's 25
centimeters<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.160> again<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:18.090> pizza<00:03:18.630> based

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
centimeters and again it's pizza based

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.590 
centimeters and again it's pizza based
on<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.560> stereo<00:03:20.280> based<00:03:20.550> calculation<00:03:21.300> that

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
on that stereo based calculation that

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.760 
on that stereo based calculation that
talked<00:03:22.530> about<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> chart<00:03:23.490> there
