00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.340
 The Aquarian Age will know the pros of silence 

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:19.886
 but in the time of Pisces, the meaning of silence was not of interest to him. 

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:25.471
 He was enchanted with matter and lived and spoke and spoke and spoke. 

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:31.974
 In the Age of Pisces, spiritual progress was only possible through silence, 

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:37.038
 however, one is focused on the loud exterior. 

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:41.838
 But only in silence comes intuition, inspiration, 

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:48.259
 the premonition and perception of the above-ground and then the being matures. 

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.944
 The Man of Aquarius is to be a spiritual being 

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:56.602
 and thus capable of being quiet and calm. 

00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:07.930
 The wise of all time knew, 

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:14.110
 that the chastening of man is not good; 

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:19.346
 So, so do less in your daily life. 

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:34.031
 Let your words be clear, full of truth, striking and concise; 

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:38.898
 also thoughtful, concise and positive. 

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:42.644
 None of yours "to make speech stand"! 

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:03.398
 Folk wisdom says, "Speak silver, keep silent!" 

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:07.413
 You know the proverb, but you do not follow it. 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.564
 Therefore this parable: 

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:25.749
 Gold and silver coins lie in the room. 

00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:31.062
 One day you will find that the gold glitters as before, 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.262
 but the silver coin grew patina. 

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:41.229
 Yes, unnecessary talking is covering you with a gray crust, 

00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:45.046
 while silence does not burden you. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.564
 And remember, the crust will have to be removed! 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.479
 Make the coin shine again. Do you understand? 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.233
 All the advanced personalities of the Earth 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.310
 they were able to keep quiet and silent at the appropriate time. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.179
 And now to you, who won't kiss. 

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:19.687
 Are you really saying that? 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.075
 It is not by chance the one who wants you to grow crust on you, 

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:29.245
 for which negative forces will attract you? 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.548
 Remember that you will have to correct in the future! 

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.158
 For every thought, every word, 

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:42.033
 by which you have burdened yourself and others; 

00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:47.033
 as well as the consequences of this. 

00:03:56.297 --> 00:04:00.568
 Therefore, please: engrave these few sentences in your mind! 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.099
 Keep repeating them, for repetition is the mother of wisdom. 

00:04:06.964 --> 00:04:11.797
 Remember, someone is interested in forgotten! 

00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:17.933
 So: "I won't say unnecessary and inappropriate words." 

00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:31.499
 Sounds hard, but it's a must! 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.350
 Learn to be silent at the right time! 

00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:39.381
 Don't say anything that low vibrates. 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.214
 Words are materialized ideas that you release to others. 

00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:52.814
 Then, before you talk, check your thoughts carefully. 

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:08.314
 Low-vibrating words load twice: 

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:13.366
 the one who released them, and the one who received them. 

00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:19.814
 And the time will come when you, both your neighbor and you, 

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:22.653
 you will need to correct them. 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.022
 Learn to become silent thinkers 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.698
 concentrate on the ideas of truth. 

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:38.835
 Then your words will be true and you will receive much more power. 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:47.299
 Through silence, man becomes strong, wise and capable. 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.785
 He uses his speech as a tool. 

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:57.385
 And the tool is meant to serve its purpose, it does not hurt. 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.404
 The sages of all ages knew, 

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:18.516
 that only in silence, peace and without words they open themselves to God's breath. 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.281
 Only then is power flowing through man 

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.650
 from an inexhaustible source. 

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:28.926
