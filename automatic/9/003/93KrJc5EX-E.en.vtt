00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.669
 when the may of 1949 roberto gonzález 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.500
 barrier began in cerralvo new lion its 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.930
 first mill to process flour from 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.580
 corn never imagined the global emporium that 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.039
 six decades later it would be the group 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.780
 Masseca gruma but what he did not imagine 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.310
 when starting a new lions is that your 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.140
 death would unleash a fight 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.420
 business and family to control the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.700
 that today is the leading corporation in 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.280
 production of corn flour and tortillas 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.650
 in the world and is that surprisingly to 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.550
 less than two months after his death 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.589
 appears on the horizon of that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 strategic food corporation the 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.789
 figure of businessman fernando chico 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.370
 Brown and his intention to acquire the 23 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.929
 percent of the top is a package that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 does not appear in the family inheritance of 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.109
 roberto gonzález barrier is the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.789
 strategic participation of 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.949
 global food conglomerate 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.929
 archer daniels midland maintains with the 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.639
 Mexican corporation and what to consummate 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.309
 its sale would modify the equilibria 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.600
 among the gruma partners because more 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.549
 beyond financial interest and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.170
 business that exhibits brown boy some 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.179
 analysts consider that its appearance 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.640
 could finish defining the fragile 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.439
 family control that was presumed solid 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.370
 long before his death roberto 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.960
 gonzález barrier 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.670
 control of their gruma and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 banorte by integrating a 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.990
 trust that would prevent eventual 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.730
 disputes between the heirs however 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.680
 litigation over the divorce failed 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.510
 favor of his ex-wife graciela morena 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.280
 a few weeks after the death of the 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.590
 Leonese entrepreneur could take a turn 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 complete to the story the combination of 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.680
 the possible entry as a shareholder of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.450
 brown boy and the rearrangement of the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.340
 family interests after the ruling that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 would dissolve the trust they would put in 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.790
 I play the balance and I could open the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.860
 door to a family conflict by the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.510
 gruma control an epicenter of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.430
 possible differences would lie in that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.380
 the two hen families gonzález 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.210
 Moreno and GonzÃ¡lez alcalá argue 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.730
 personal differences and vision of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.010
 business and the frictions seem to be every day 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.870
 more obvious another epicenter of the 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.700
 potential conflict would lie in the fact that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.740
 heirs of roberto gonzález barrier no 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.500
 are the children but their grandchildren children of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 berta roberto graciela juan and mayra la 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.190
 the only exception is that of Roberto 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.870
 gonzález alcalá who would have inherited from 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.160
 direct way because their children 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.140
 They are still minors 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.270
 berta gonzález Moreno though I would not have 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.470
 inherited directly owned a package 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 shareholder- personally 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.370
 allow a certain differentiated position 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.409
 independent of the inheritance 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.940
 in their children a third epicenter of 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.440
 possible dispute is the difference of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.239
 styles and visions that about the company 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.069
 have the brothers two of which 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.750
 they operated inside grotto roberto 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.269
 gonzález alcalá is the most identified 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.860
 with gruma manages the direction of mexico 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.810
 and Latin America besides the subsidiaries 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.060
 in venezuela and central america juan 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.159
 gonzález Moreno in turn is dedicated to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.690
 the operations in asia and oceania without 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.790
 However, what would become the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.680
 more strategic battle could be run 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.299
 in the field of politics is there 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.340
 where the participation of different 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.319
 actors some related to the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.390
 financial and political world but also 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.220
 family would seek to influence the management 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.019
 of business inherited by Roberto 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.209
 gonzález barrier is the case of Carlos 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.640
 hank rhon son of the legendary politician 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.040
 Carlos Gonzalez Hank and current president 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.590
 of interactions and group hermes is the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.680
 husband of graciela gonzález moreno una 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.680
 of the daughters of the deceased businessman 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
