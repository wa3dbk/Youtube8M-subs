00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
better edge sanding block you just

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.030 
better edge sanding block you just
simply<00:00:35.810> run<00:00:36.810> them<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.230> down<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.560> you<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
nice smooth edge all the way around to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.610 
nice smooth edge all the way around to
the<00:00:39.960> front<00:00:41.149> from<00:00:42.149> there<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.840> take<00:00:43.050> curved

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the front from there you take curved

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.139 
the front from there you take curved
scissors<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:45.980> about<00:00:46.980> 1/8<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> an<00:00:47.579> inch<00:00:47.670> inside

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the trim line of each wheel well just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
the trim line of each wheel well just
cut<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:51.809> doesn't<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.679> be<00:00:52.769> perfect

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
cut around doesn't have to be perfect

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
cut around doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:00:53.609> we're<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> sanding

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
because we're going to use the sanding

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
because we're going to use the sanding
drum<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.260> make<00:00:55.859> it<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> nice<00:00:56.219> smooth<00:00:56.579> edge<00:00:56.870> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
drum to make it a nice smooth edge so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.360 
drum to make it a nice smooth edge so
I've<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> better<00:00:58.530> edge<00:00:58.710> sanding<00:00:59.190> drum

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I've got the better edge sanding drum

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.049 
I've got the better edge sanding drum
here<00:01:00.469> putting<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> our<00:01:01.739> dremel<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.219> any<00:01:02.850> other

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
here putting in our dremel or any other

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
here putting in our dremel or any other
rotary<00:01:03.510> tool<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.839> work<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.290> turn<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> like

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
rotary tool will work I turn it to like

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.460 
rotary tool will work I turn it to like
a<00:01:05.850> medium<00:01:06.360> rpm<00:01:06.750> doesn't<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.230> super

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a medium rpm doesn't have to be super

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
a medium rpm doesn't have to be super
high<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:08.220> it'll<00:01:08.490> glide<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
high because it'll glide through the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.350 
high because it'll glide through the
lexan<00:01:09.300> pretty<00:01:09.510> nice<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:09.960> turn<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> then

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
lexan pretty nice so turn it on and then

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.510 
lexan pretty nice so turn it on and then
you<00:01:12.450> simply<00:01:12.840> grind<00:01:13.440> away<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> lexan<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you simply grind away all the lexan you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
you simply grind away all the lexan you
need<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.820> you've<00:01:14.940> got<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> perfect<00:01:15.300> edge<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
need so you've got the perfect edge it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
need so you've got the perfect edge it
goes<00:01:16.260> pretty<00:01:16.500> quickly<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.950> once<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.880> done

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
goes pretty quickly so once you're done

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
goes pretty quickly so once you're done
then<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.020> clean<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.680> edge<00:01:19.799> with

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
then you can just clean up the edge with

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
then you can just clean up the edge with
an<00:01:20.130> exacto<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.420> you've<00:01:24.720> got

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
an exacto so then from there you've got

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
an exacto so then from there you've got
your<00:01:25.070> you've<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.369> front<00:01:26.579> wheels<00:01:26.909> done<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
your you've got your front wheels done I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
your you've got your front wheels done I
usually<00:01:27.509> leave<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> back<00:01:27.930> till<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> end

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
usually leave the back till the end

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
usually leave the back till the end
because<00:01:29.219> every<00:01:29.490> touring<00:01:29.939> car<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> different

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
because every touring car is a different

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
because every touring car is a different
wheel<00:01:30.630> base<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.170> we'll<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.799> after<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.219> put

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
wheel base so we'll do that after we put

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.020 
wheel base so we'll do that after we put
our<00:01:32.490> body<00:01:32.640> holes<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:34.460> come<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> our<00:01:35.700> chassis

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
our body holes in come to our chassis

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.130 
our body holes in come to our chassis
here<00:01:37.549> we've<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:38.700> crosshair<00:01:39.689> mounting

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here we've got our crosshair mounting

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.870 
here we've got our crosshair mounting
kit<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:41.579> open<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.090> you'll<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
kit you open that up you'll take out a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
kit you open that up you'll take out a
post<00:01:44.880> cap<00:01:45.200> put<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.289> right<00:01:46.380> onto<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.680> body

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
post cap put it right onto your body

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.709 
post cap put it right onto your body
post<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.520> using<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.850> body<00:01:48.090> clip<00:01:48.360> you're

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
post and then using a body clip you're

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.350 
post and then using a body clip you're
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.170> through<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> hole

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
going to put it right through the hole

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.340 
going to put it right through the hole
just<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.719> one<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.799> each<00:01:52.890> body<00:01:53.100> post

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
just like that one on each body post

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
just like that one on each body post
then<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.469> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> take<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.920> body<00:01:56.060> put
