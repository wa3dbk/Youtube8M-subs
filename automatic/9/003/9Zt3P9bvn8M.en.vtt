also<00:00:12.019> we<00:00:12.200> can<00:00:12.349> measure<00:00:12.500> amperage<00:00:14.680> so<00:00:15.680> we've

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
also we can measure amperage so we've

because<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.030> very<00:00:38.090> dangerous<00:00:39.309> so<00:00:40.309> I've

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
because it is very dangerous so I've

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.099 
because it is very dangerous so I've
just<00:00:40.969> looked<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.390> up<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.690> show<00:00:41.749> you<00:00:41.899> how<00:00:42.050> to

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
just looked this up to show you how to

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:50.470 
just looked this up to show you how to
do<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.469> on<00:00:42.859> an<00:00:43.699> 18<00:00:44.210> volt<00:00:44.480> set<00:00:44.719> up<00:00:49.480> this

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
do it on an 18 volt set up this

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.989 
do it on an 18 volt set up this
particular<00:00:50.809> meter<00:00:51.609> there's<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.730> clump

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
particular meter there's a clump

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.270 
particular meter there's a clump
function<00:00:53.510> there<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.859> you<00:00:55.039> can<00:00:55.159> actually

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
function there and you can actually

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.860 
function there and you can actually
clumb<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.879> over<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.960> wire<00:00:58.420> but<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.569> can

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
clumb that over a wire but you can

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.389 
clumb that over a wire but you can
measure<00:01:00.079> your<00:01:00.170> voltage<00:01:00.589> by<00:01:00.890> doing<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.280> you

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
measure your voltage by doing that you

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.829 
measure your voltage by doing that you
can<00:01:01.519> only<00:01:01.640> measure<00:01:01.850> if<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.210> actual<00:01:02.329> lump<00:01:02.690> so

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
can only measure if the actual lump so

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.120 
can only measure if the actual lump so
it's<00:01:02.929> going<00:01:03.079> through<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.559> way<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.710> if<00:01:07.040> you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
it's going through the way you so if you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.590 
it's going through the way you so if you
look<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.460> I've<00:01:07.550> actually<00:01:07.700> selected<00:01:08.500> AC<00:01:09.500> amps

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
look that I've actually selected AC amps

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.260 
look that I've actually selected AC amps
now<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> DC<00:01:12.620> on<00:01:13.340> food<00:01:13.820> setup

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
now this is a DC on food setup

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.359 
now this is a DC on food setup
but<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.110> will<00:01:15.200> still<00:01:15.439> work<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:15.979> you'll<00:01:16.130> get<00:01:16.250> an

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
but it will still work but you'll get an

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.149 
but it will still work but you'll get an
incorrect<00:01:16.790> reading<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:18.710> I'm<00:01:18.860> just<00:01:19.009> going<00:01:19.130> to

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
incorrect reading but I'm just going to

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.850 
incorrect reading but I'm just going to
show<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:19.780> how<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.840> measure<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.380> actual<00:01:21.500> amps

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
show you how to measure the actual amps

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.690 
show you how to measure the actual amps
going<00:01:21.979> through<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:24.409> one<00:01:25.219> thing<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.549> should

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
going through so one thing you should

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.709 
going through so one thing you should
never<00:01:25.820> do<00:01:26.119> is<00:01:26.500> try<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.740> measure<00:01:28.159> both<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
never do is try and measure both of the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.149 
never do is try and measure both of the
way<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.140> ones<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:31.009> won't

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
way is it ones because that just won't

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:31.469 
way is it ones because that just won't
work

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
work

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.719 
work
they'll<00:01:32.479> just<00:01:32.659> cancel<00:01:33.020> each<00:01:33.140> other<00:01:33.259> out<00:01:33.860> lots

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
they'll just cancel each other out lots

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.920 
they'll just cancel each other out lots
of<00:01:34.850> people<00:01:34.969> don't<00:01:35.329> realize<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:35.899> can

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
of people don't realize that you can

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.349 
of people don't realize that you can
measure<00:01:36.259> amps<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> positive<00:01:37.549> side<00:01:37.579> or<00:01:38.119> on

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
measure amps on the positive side or on

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.550 
measure amps on the positive side or on
the<00:01:38.390> negative<00:01:38.509> side<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.200> doesn't<00:01:39.439> really

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the negative side it doesn't really

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.300 
the negative side it doesn't really
matter<00:01:39.770> which<00:01:40.009> side<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.310> use<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.189> to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
matter which side you use so I just to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.580 
matter which side you use so I just to
prove<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.759> I'll<00:01:44.689> just<00:01:44.869> stick<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.049> over<00:01:45.229> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
prove it I'll just stick that over the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.080 
prove it I'll just stick that over the
positive<00:01:46.009> side<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:49.640> will<00:01:49.820> give<00:01:49.969> us<00:01:50.030> a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
positive side and this will give us a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.929 
positive side and this will give us a
false<00:01:50.359> reading<00:01:50.630> by<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:50.930> way<00:01:51.109> because<00:01:51.759> this<00:01:52.759> is

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
false reading by the way because this is

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.969 
false reading by the way because this is
set<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.270> AC<00:01:53.570> amps<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.350> we're<00:01:54.469> measuring<00:01:54.649> DC

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
set to AC amps and we're measuring DC

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.910 
set to AC amps and we're measuring DC
amps<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:57.020> see<00:01:57.200> when<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.530> squeeze<00:01:57.740> this

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
amps you see when you squeeze this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.340 
amps you see when you squeeze this
trigger

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
trigger

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.640 
trigger
the<00:02:00.220> UNPROFOR<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.900> I'll<00:02:05.050> just<00:02:05.200> do<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.530> the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
the UNPROFOR so I'll just do that on the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:15.870 
the UNPROFOR so I'll just do that on the
negative<00:02:06.040> side<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.610> see

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
negative side now so there you can see

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
negative side now so there you can see
when<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.360> squeeze<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.750> trigger<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.320> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
when you squeeze the trigger and you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.190 
when you squeeze the trigger and you
start<00:02:17.770> pulling<00:02:18.220> some<00:02:18.340> amps<00:02:18.610> through<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:19.200> they

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
start pulling some amps through it they

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.360 
start pulling some amps through it they
just<00:02:20.440> start<00:02:20.650> giving<00:02:20.860> you're<00:02:20.980> reading

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
just start giving you're reading

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.810 
just start giving you're reading
although<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.850> won't<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.120> an<00:02:22.209> accurate<00:02:22.330> reading

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
although it won't be an accurate reading

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.100 
although it won't be an accurate reading
so<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> multimeter<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:25.959> going

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
so this is the multimeter that I'm going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.340 
so this is the multimeter that I'm going
to<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.230> using<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.570> look<00:02:28.720> at<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.959> there

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
to be using and if you look at it there

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.070 
to be using and if you look at it there
I've<00:02:29.410> already<00:02:29.830> switched<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.420> 20<00:02:31.900> amp

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I've already switched it to the 20 amp

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.520 
I've already switched it to the 20 amp
mic<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:34.209> also<00:02:34.600> when<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.900> measure<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.260> amps

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
mic and also when you measure in amps

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.030 
mic and also when you measure in amps
really<00:02:35.709> support<00:02:36.100> one<00:02:37.030> leading<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.480> 20<00:02:37.840> amp

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
really support one leading the 20 amp

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.860 
really support one leading the 20 amp
terminal<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.550> one<00:02:39.970> lead<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> Kanto

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
terminal and one lead in the Kanto

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:57.360 
terminal and one lead in the Kanto
middle<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.620> I'll<00:02:41.739> just<00:02:41.890> do<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:56.370> then

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
middle so I'll just do that now then

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.680 
middle so I'll just do that now then
I'll<00:02:57.519> turn<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.940> way<00:02:58.000> then<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.390> see

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
I'll turn it that way then you can see

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.470 
I'll turn it that way then you can see
it<00:02:59.100> so<00:03:00.100> now<00:03:00.340> if<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.790> break<00:03:00.970> into<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.360> cable<00:03:03.480> to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
it so now if I break into this cable to

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.170 
it so now if I break into this cable to
put<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> positive<00:03:04.959> from<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.470> battery<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
put the positive from the battery to the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.860 
put the positive from the battery to the
positive<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> meter<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.630> calm

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
positive on the meter and then the calm

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.670 
positive on the meter and then the calm
side<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.549> side<00:03:15.760> going<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.269> drill

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
side to that side going to the drill

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.030 
side to that side going to the drill
then<00:03:17.680> I'll<00:03:17.769> switch<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:20.650> soon<00:03:20.799> as<00:03:20.920> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
then I'll switch it on as soon as I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.350 
then I'll switch it on as soon as I
squeeze<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> trigger

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440 

maybe<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.540> arms<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.820> argonauts<00:03:28.209> squeeze

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
maybe the arms and the argonauts squeeze

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.550 
maybe the arms and the argonauts squeeze
the<00:03:28.540> trigger<00:03:28.720> because<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:29.440> got

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
the trigger because it's got

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.800 
the trigger because it's got
proportionate<00:03:30.160> control<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:31.480> starts

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
proportionate control that starts

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:40.800 
proportionate control that starts
pulling<00:03:31.989> more<00:03:32.230> up

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.600 

and<00:03:41.810> also<00:03:42.140> if<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.350> put<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.560> drill<00:03:43.220> into<00:03:43.370> some

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
and also if you put a drill into some

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.270 
and also if you put a drill into some
lord<00:03:43.880> by<00:03:44.210> squeezing<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.990> chalk<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.980> should

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
lord by squeezing the chalk it should

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.210 
lord by squeezing the chalk it should
pull<00:03:46.520> even<00:03:46.760> more<00:03:46.940> amps<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.770> can<00:03:51.890> see<00:03:52.040> that

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
pull even more amps and you can see that

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.310 
pull even more amps and you can see that
the<00:03:52.460> amps<00:03:52.700> they<00:03:52.850> go<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.540> if<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:56.960> just<00:03:57.080> put

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
the amps they go up so if we just put

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
the amps they go up so if we just put
this<00:03:58.010> ad<00:03:58.250> back<00:03:58.520> now

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.309 

but<00:04:13.120> I'll<00:04:13.209> show<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.420> again<00:04:13.750> on<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> neutral

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
but I'll show you again on the neutral

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:31.920 
but I'll show you again on the neutral
side

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.220 

so<00:04:32.930> again<00:04:33.350> we've<00:04:33.560> broken<00:04:33.770> into<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.130> circuit

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
so again we've broken into the circuit

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.350 
so again we've broken into the circuit
and<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:37.400> meter<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.700> now<00:04:37.850> in<00:04:38.000> between<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and the meter is now in between the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.770 
and the meter is now in between the
neutral<00:04:39.230> side<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.970> again<00:04:41.240> when<00:04:41.420> we<00:04:41.450> squeeze<00:04:41.750> a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
neutral side so again when we squeeze a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.820 
neutral side so again when we squeeze a
trigger<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:43.780> can<00:04:44.780> see<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.230> meter<00:04:45.470> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
trigger you can see that the meter is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.020 
trigger you can see that the meter is
measuring<00:04:46.510> how<00:04:47.510> many<00:04:47.720> amps<00:04:47.930> are<00:04:48.110> used<00:04:49.030> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
measuring how many amps are used and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.030 
measuring how many amps are used and
again<00:04:50.720> if<00:04:51.050> we<00:04:51.110> put<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.350> machine<00:04:51.590> under<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.830> lot

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
again if we put the machine under a lot

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.560 
again if we put the machine under a lot
of<00:04:52.070> law<00:04:52.280> by<00:04:52.550> squeezing<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.120> trigger<00:04:53.240> at<00:04:53.540> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
of law by squeezing the trigger at the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.750 
of law by squeezing the trigger at the
same<00:04:53.780> time<00:04:56.140> you<00:04:57.140> can<00:04:57.320> see<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.680> amps<00:04:58.010> go

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
same time you can see that the amps go

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.660 
same time you can see that the amps go
up<00:04:59.320> so<00:05:00.320> that's<00:05:00.500> how<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.710> measure<00:05:00.980> I'm<00:05:01.220> choosing

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
up so that's how to measure I'm choosing

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.870 
up so that's how to measure I'm choosing
a<00:05:01.730> multimeter<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:04.070> again<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.460> just<00:05:04.490> like<00:05:04.730> to

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
a multimeter and again I just like to

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.150 
a multimeter and again I just like to
reiterate<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:06.500> shouldn't<00:05:06.740> do<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.010> on

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
reiterate that you shouldn't do this on

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.220 
reiterate that you shouldn't do this on
mains<00:05:07.370> voltage<00:05:07.850> electricity<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:08.960> share<00:05:09.200> a

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
mains voltage electricity and I share a

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.720 
mains voltage electricity and I share a
professional<00:05:09.770> electrician<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.460> you
