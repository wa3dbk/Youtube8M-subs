00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
just using a little bit of paper with

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
just using a little bit of paper with
some<00:02:23.230> butter<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.880> next<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.360> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
some butter on it so next I'm going to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.320 
some butter on it so next I'm going to
peel<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.560> core<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.250> apples<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.090> I'm<00:02:28.150> using

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
peel and core the apples and I'm using

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.650 
peel and core the apples and I'm using
brave<00:02:28.840> or<00:02:29.110> an<00:02:29.230> apples<00:02:29.680> for<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:31.420> in

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
brave or an apples for this I think in

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.920 
brave or an apples for this I think in
North<00:02:31.900> America<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.500> use<00:02:32.920> Cortland<00:02:33.670> which<00:02:34.660> this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
North America is use Cortland which this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.870 
North America is use Cortland which this
variety<00:02:35.380> isn't<00:02:35.740> available<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.730> I'm

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
variety isn't available here so I'm

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.510 
variety isn't available here so I'm
using<00:02:37.060> Braeburn<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.230> an<00:02:38.320> apple<00:02:38.530> corer<00:02:38.980> here

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
using Braeburn but an apple corer here

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.240 
using Braeburn but an apple corer here
makes<00:02:40.390> things<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.840> lot<00:02:41.110> easier<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.920> take<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
makes things a lot easier to take the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.430 
makes things a lot easier to take the
core<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.270> then<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.780> slice<00:02:47.110> up

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
core out and then you can just slice up

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
core out and then you can just slice up
the<00:02:48.310> apples<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:54.850> put<00:02:55.090> directly

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the apples and if you just put directly

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.590 
the apples and if you just put directly
into<00:02:56.080> your<00:02:56.850> dish<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.830> prepared<00:03:00.160> dish<00:03:00.600> make

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
into your dish to the prepared dish make

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.820 
into your dish to the prepared dish make
sure<00:03:01.720> you're<00:03:01.840> gonna<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.230> fast<00:03:02.530> because
