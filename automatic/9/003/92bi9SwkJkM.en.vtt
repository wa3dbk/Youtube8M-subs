00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:37.630 
the normal magic hand switch first the
DX<00:02:16.830> 1<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> let's<00:02:21.420> put<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:27.260> Activity<00:02:28.260> module

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.020 

then<00:02:38.640> I'll<00:02:38.850> show<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> guys<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.690> switch<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
then I'll show you guys this switch the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.710 
then I'll show you guys this switch the
VT<00:02:45.209> module<00:02:52.400> as<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.580> guys<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.970> see<00:02:54.030> this

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
VT module as you guys can see this

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.229 
VT module as you guys can see this
sounds<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.560> totally<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.190> same<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.850> because

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
sounds is totally the same is because

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.390 
sounds is totally the same is because
the<00:02:57.900> sounds<00:02:58.320> doesn't<00:02:58.739> come<00:02:58.890> up<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.130> switch

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the sounds doesn't come up with switch

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
the sounds doesn't come up with switch
it<00:02:59.670> comes<00:02:59.910> from<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.600> driver<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:04.340> just

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it comes from the for the driver so just

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.550 
it comes from the for the driver so just
two<00:03:05.519> things<00:03:05.760> over<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.300> are<00:03:06.510> exactly<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
two things over here are exactly the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.160 
two things over here are exactly the
same<00:03:07.590> hence<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.519> get<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> same<00:03:09.030> sounds<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
same hence we get the same sounds the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.890 
same hence we get the same sounds the
only<00:03:10.350> thing<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:11.610> Sun<00:03:11.820> lights<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.180> that's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
only thing is the Sun lights up that's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.720 
only thing is the Sun lights up that's
about<00:03:13.200> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.190 

so<00:03:23.730> that's<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> only<00:03:24.150> difference<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:25.050> is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so that's the only difference which is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.059 
so that's the only difference which is
to<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:25.860> honest<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> pretty<00:03:27.180> awesome<00:03:27.980> limits<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
to be honest is pretty awesome limits a

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:39.020 
to be honest is pretty awesome limits a
break<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.769> sincerely<00:03:38.370> hope<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.730> guys

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
break so I sincerely hope you guys

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.539
