00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 the recipe of the day m 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:23.570
 verhille lawyer tweet smoke the verrine 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.850
 is composed of three layers of the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.070
 smoked trout with fresh cheese and herbs 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.349
 and the lawyer for the preparation for 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.419
 fresh cheese we will crush cheese 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.100
 fresh with chopped chives 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.620
 so the easiest way is to do it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.360
 with scissors we crush with a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.260
 spoon until the preparation 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.479
 be very smooth 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.890
 so if ever your cheese fresh and 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.239
 a little thick you can add a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.199
 tablespoon milk or cream 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.580
 here it is created the to itself it is 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.019
 really the consistency we're looking for 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.040
 we are now dealing with trout 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.239
 smoke that will be cut into small 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.409
 pieces it's easier to eat 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.670
 of them pay 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.580
 I do this with scissors it's 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.650
 easier then to the site uses 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.150
 many scissors in the kitchen say it 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 me in the comments and especially ten 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 month they serve you it's good for 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.870
 the salmon we will be able to move to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.070
 then the lawyer I do last 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870
 simply because his black flesh 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 so very fast so much as it remains 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.280
 as long as possible 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.650
 we will start with the coupe in two 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 9 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.040
 to remove the kernel it's very simple 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.040
 we give a little knife in front of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 easy 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 we add salt 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.930
 pepper and a little lemon juice 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.880
 both for good and for avoiding 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.390
 that the lawyer does not blacken one crushes 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.210
 the lawyer all the elements are ready on 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.160
 will raise the legacies to fill 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.980
 the verrines yield 2 spoons or 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.480
 a socket pocket 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.590
 you do not have a socket pocket there 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.770
 you just have to use a bag 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.770
 freezing 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.100
 same thing with fresh cheese 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.680
 we will start with the preparation to 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:18.209
 the lawyer then I cut the tip off we go 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.209
 first make a layer of lawyers 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.579
 a layer of fresh cheese 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.319
 another rld lawyer 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:36.269
 and finally another fresh cheese with 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.269
 herbs on top of smoked trout 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.319
 have finished putting the others will be on 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.319

 a small sprig of dill or chives 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.060
 to decorate and there is more than 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.060
