00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
from the game others say they are just

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.380 
from the game others say they are just
strangely<00:03:23.260> cut<00:03:23.500> tree<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:24.430> my<00:03:24.610> opinion<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.330> am

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
strangely cut tree in my opinion I am

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.900 
strangely cut tree in my opinion I am
not<00:03:25.630> who<00:03:25.840> what<00:03:26.049> these<00:03:26.200> things<00:03:26.230> are<00:03:26.650> maybe<00:03:27.489> if<00:03:27.730> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
not who what these things are maybe if a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.660 
not who what these things are maybe if a
mario<00:03:28.269> galaxy<00:03:28.510> 3<00:03:29.260> came<00:03:29.530> out<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.920> level<00:03:30.310> would<00:03:30.459> be

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
mario galaxy 3 came out a level would be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.110 
mario galaxy 3 came out a level would be
based<00:03:30.880> off<00:03:31.120> these<00:03:31.360> creatures<00:03:31.600> or<00:03:31.989> trees<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:34.090> I

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
based off these creatures or trees but I

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.020 
based off these creatures or trees but I
seriously<00:03:34.959> doubt<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:36.519> would<00:03:37.000> happen

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
seriously doubt that that would happen

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.449 
seriously doubt that that would happen

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
maybe Nintendo just sat in a room and

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.640
