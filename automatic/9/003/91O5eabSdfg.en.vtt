00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 chains are all is essential 

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.430
 that they were thousands ago 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.410
 of years according to historians 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 the metal chains were used to make 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.040
 jewels hindrances for prisoners 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 and building materials 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.420
 nowadays we use them for these 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.520
 same uses and many more 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 chains form links that we 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.980
 unite with the past and do not risk 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 to break 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 we use chains to fix 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.160
 collect or draw objects and their 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.350
 various sizes vary according to their 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 use 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.540
 a drum unrolls this wire rod and the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 passes through a guide ring 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.059
 then in a box draws the thread 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.950
 and lubricated by Greece which is to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.539
 interior 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 coming out of the box the son is 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.460
 inserted in a sector like the one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.100
 here we see the diameter of the die 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.899
 is smaller than that of the son then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 emerging from the industry 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 the son sam so while becoming more 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.510
 hard and more resistant this is a 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.420
 machine to form a tool called 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.119
 a dead man advances the thread at the same 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 time another dead grows on the wire and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.800
 the wrong around a steel rod 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.900
 this gives the shape of a c 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 another type buck the knows what 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.620
 complete a link in the chain then 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 the other dead creates the next link 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.700
 this machine produces a string a 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.090
 swimsuit that is used to suspend 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 fixtures 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.409
 and another machine to form his brick 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450
 a string that can pull a load 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.490
 heavier 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.050
 an advance passes feeds a wire 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050
 between rollers 10 which is their 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.600
 steel blades founded in size of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 both sides of the son these nicks 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 indicate where you will decide 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 the wire into sections the size of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.270
 mayom a mechanical knife performed the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 final cut of the cuts 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.800
 wraps a stretch of wire around a 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.350
 steel finger his arms in the air of 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.580
 proceed easily and in reality they 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.410
 apply tons of pressure 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.750
 mechanical to form the wire once 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.660
 that the link has been fashioned a pincer 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.910
 the cesi and the returns 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.560
 this positions the link to complete 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.610
 so that it can be connected to the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.200
 following while being shaped as 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.480
 as the links accumulate 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.480
 the chain without battery under the machine 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 most chain factories account 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.240
 dozens of machines to train 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 each of them produces about 50 or 60 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.290
 million per minute 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.010
 this equates to approximately 76 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.840
 meters of chains per machine per hour 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.700
 in other words, in this hour a machine 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.709
 could make a chain whose 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.340
 length would be equal to the height of the 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.340
 turn of the cn 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.099
 now that we have formed the chain 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.980
 we have to reinforce it the next step 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.829
 roll out at the slot machine of both 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.599
 hammers closes the jersey and then two 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.999
 copper blocks appear from both 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.310
 else acting as electrodes 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.500
 it releases an electric current of 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.540
 each side of the shirt the current 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.370
 crosses the gap in the link while 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 that hammers exert their pressure 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.370
 which melts the thread and merges the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.370
 shirt 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.170
 now a pulley system lowers 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.330
 the chain in a reel hose 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.890
 heat treatment a current 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.990
 electrical goes into the coil of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.600
 copper and heats the chain until 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.100
 to be incandescent 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.440
 the pulley drives the chain into a 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.900
 water tank where it cools the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.190
 extreme temperature changes 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.800
 changes the molecular structure of 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.100
 steel and makes it very little hard but this 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.870
 process makes the chain a bit brittle on 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.610
 so inserts the string into another 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.580
 coil hose less hot than the 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.420
 first the chain cooled again 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.400
 in water 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.760
 this eliminates the fragility of steel and 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.690
 gives it flexibility 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.950
 it's time for the resistance test 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.230
 mechanical 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.870
 here are the hookers who evaluate the 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.790
 chain a pulley drives the chain 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.550
 in a groove in the middle of a block 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.620
 of steel a clamping flange holds the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.810
 string by the left while a block 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.650
 hydraulically controlled steel la draws 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.380
 by the right 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.220
 will she broken can she endure 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.230
 this charge 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.220
 as for human beings everything depends 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.220
 the weakest link
