00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 good to everyone today the dow we are in 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.390
 minecraft 1.6 point 4 let's see a mod 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.390
 what is this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 Hello 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.750
 I had not seen it 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.750
 let's continue that there 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 and still 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.050
 now the diamond iron 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 and how do you sometimes tell me that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.870
 you want the seeds I put of the seed 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.460
 and these are the coordinates of people by 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 wise he was interested in something here too 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.699
 but well let's see let's see a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.470
 so it 's pretty cool and I think 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.570
 that should be in banking look what 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.970
 I tell you it 's a bad thing that adds sand 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.190
 moving 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.760
 that the bad thing is that it's not in the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 desert but add two good things 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 three beyond this one here that is sand 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 hollow 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 so we check it 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.430
 so I could not stay like that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.430
 no no 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.409
 the and you die good already of this one because 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 can you really escape 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.630
 It's a little weird like with a game 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.930
 it works but because sometimes 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.420
 sometimes you can not pass and on the other hand 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 yes 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 but well it's good I like the other 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 Once I like to be here I have had 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:55.920
 luck in the biome this weird ugly that does not 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 I get now the swamp of suns 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.820
 we have the quicksand that is like that 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.800
 I like the strip 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.440
 these yes I like I like 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
 a lot besides that it's just that you 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.759
 you fall and you go sinking 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.760
 if it can not be 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.610
 we are going to put on survival and I have touched 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.230
 now a block so I sink more 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 but yes we do have two last cycles 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 and we are seeing that it is very cool but 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.920
 very cool I loved it 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.409
 but it was very cool especially you can 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.129
 cheating but now the arena is 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.269
 hollow 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.519
 the part of pillar we can 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.129
 make us with sand as well as 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.129
 you are seeing the cross on the tongue and the 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.420
 quicksand is sand ground and a 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.920
 water block we can put in 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.260
 any of the three sites that gives 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.180
 same 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.180
 but it appeared very very cool 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 I did not want you to have 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.330
 what a pity 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.180
 for inside but not 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.220
 perhaps pride 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.200
 Well that was very cautious but 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.100
 we can do this also that is a 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.830
 hook 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.180
 we need a vote left work 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.610
 iron and the king and a bow rope and a 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.270
 peak of iron and with this simply 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.590
 we can go out let's continue tintin 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.980
 when we are sinking we do more 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.280
 difficult to start I guess 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.080
 colors 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.510
 I guess that's why the entity bet 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.480
 here because if you put it in a desert 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.740
 what is the meaning of this is to say here 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.319
 because there are trees you can get caught 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.319
 a tree and salts but not 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.170
 you put here for example you take here 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.920
 you have not just left and we can not not 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.989
 it serves now but of normal you can not not 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.879
 you can jump then why 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.790
 better uncle has put it has decided 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.410
 put it here where there are goals but it's 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.410
 very cool and also 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.750
 other cool things I've checked we're going to 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.670
 try it and now 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.670
 ok live 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.280
 so the bugs detect it as 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.979
 a normal block is to say that we can 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.949
 cheating with them and is very cool 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.949
 hip hop break lÃ­pez and something like that for the 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:49.680
 half you only look like a lettuce and a cloak 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:51.660
 but this is the way how can they 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.430
 move well 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.220
 but it's cool to do 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.220
 trap especially because normal 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.860
 the world the sky or good 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.760
 the truth that I like a lot we are going to 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.420
 teach what you have in the description 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.420
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:29.680
 transportation for transport 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.680
 well I liked that 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.110
 bye 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.350
 here we are
