 Speaking here asking a video question is 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170
 that same video I ask who hears and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 question is what I ask for in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.060
 channel or not of background fab nada 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.050
 too much 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 I want to ask you is this 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:41.940

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:30.390
