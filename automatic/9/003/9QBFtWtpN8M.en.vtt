00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.540
 wsus but I think this option 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.800

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.819
 now cut carrots onions and tomatoes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.180
 everything will be cut into cubes very shallow 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.180

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.819
 marduk cut in half and hanged 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.819

 about a minute on medium heat 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.590
 visually beat off the meat I will add 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:24.079
 he has a second spoonful of 1 degree young and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.269
 interfere with getting fucked in the ass for meat 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.549
 extra breading of the first 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.860
 on and off and move further 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.110
 turn on the oven for minimum heat 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.840
 now cut to big like potatoes 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.400
 I have a young snuff 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.630

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.960
 Scuff pots before using I 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.610
