00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.649 
anyways this game there's a time
persistent<00:01:13.930> world<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.770> pretty<00:01:15.250> much

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
persistent world that pretty much

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.910 
persistent world that pretty much
encourages<00:01:16.659> replay<00:01:17.020> value<00:01:17.170> because<00:01:17.740> what

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
encourages replay value because what

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.410 
encourages replay value because what

generation you think like after so many

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.280 
generation you think like after so many
times<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.630> they<00:02:10.780> would<00:02:10.869> forego<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
times like they would forego the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.140

and it looks really good so all right
how<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.140> works<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.470> there's<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.769> overclock

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
how this works is there's an overclock

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.910 
how this works is there's an overclock
bun<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.390> actually<00:02:19.540> spawn<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.440> as<00:02:20.739> an

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
bun and you can actually spawn it as an

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.259 
bun and you can actually spawn it as an
item<00:02:21.070> store<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.459> can<00:02:21.609> buy<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.820> whenever<00:02:22.030> you

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
item store you can buy it whenever you

charge<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.390> height<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.500> would

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
charge it height and then this would

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.680 
charge it height and then this would
actually<00:02:26.829> get<00:02:27.100> me<00:02:27.250> oh<00:02:27.400> alright<00:02:28.359> press<00:02:28.569> their

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
run run run run there's a stamina gauge

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.869 
run run run run there's a stamina gauge
right<00:03:45.709> there<00:03:45.919> you<00:03:46.069> can<00:03:46.189> see<00:03:46.219> it<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.730> blue

thing and this will all obviously affect

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.699 
thing and this will all obviously affect
what<00:03:50.900> your<00:03:51.019> stats<00:03:51.259> going<00:03:51.439> to<00:03:51.500> be<00:03:51.560> like<00:03:51.650> when

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
what your stats going to be like when

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.219 
what your stats going to be like when
you<00:03:51.829> get<00:03:52.009> into<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.729> action<00:03:53.659> or<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.900> fighting

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.869 
you get into the action or the fighting
sequences<00:03:54.439> so<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:55.430> best<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.729> be<00:03:55.849> prepared

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
sequences so it's best to be prepared

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.559 
sequences so it's best to be prepared
when<00:03:56.359> you<00:03:56.419> run<00:03:56.659> it<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:58.099> as<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.459> go<00:03:58.609> in

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
to overclock right now there once i

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.080 
to overclock right now there once i
overclock<00:04:55.280> i<00:04:55.400> could<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:55.669> keep<00:04:55.880> on

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
overclock i could just keep on

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.790 
overclock i could just keep on
destroying<00:04:56.900> until<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.320> time<00:04:57.500> runs<00:04:57.650> out
