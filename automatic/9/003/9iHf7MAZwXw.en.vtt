00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
a weakness of this backpack they put the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.820 
a weakness of this backpack they put the
straps<00:05:21.910> here<00:05:22.150> on<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.390> handles<00:05:22.840> now<00:05:23.410> usually

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
straps here on the handles now usually

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.940 
straps here on the handles now usually
it's<00:05:24.370> up<00:05:24.610> here<00:05:24.970> on<00:05:25.210> most<00:05:25.420> backpacks<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.620> here

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.050 
it's up here on most backpacks so here
I'm<00:05:27.100> just<00:05:27.130> worried<00:05:27.580> about<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.850> long-term

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
I'm just worried about the long-term

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.960 
I'm just worried about the long-term
durability<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.280> pulling<00:05:30.610> on<00:05:30.850> the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
durability because it is pulling on the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.090 
durability because it is pulling on the
straps<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:32.050> might<00:05:32.320> rip<00:05:32.500> in<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.680> future

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
straps and it might rip in the future

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.500 
straps and it might rip in the future
but<00:05:33.370> I'm<00:05:33.610> not<00:05:33.730> really<00:05:33.940> worried<00:05:34.270> about<00:05:34.330> that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
but I'm not really worried about that

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.390 
but I'm not really worried about that
right<00:05:34.690> now

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
right now

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.740 
right now
so<00:05:36.400> overall<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.180> backpack<00:05:37.570> is

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
so overall the backpack is

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
so overall the backpack is
well-constructed

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
well-constructed

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.190 
well-constructed
