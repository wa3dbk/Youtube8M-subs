it's gone into setup ok setup is quite
easy<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.850> use<00:00:53.210> again<00:00:53.660> we've<00:00:54.560> got<00:00:54.610> fuel<00:00:55.610> which<00:00:55.880> i

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
easy to use again we've got fuel which i

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.000 
easy to use again we've got fuel which i
actually<00:00:56.270> select<00:00:56.960> what<00:00:57.170> type<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.470> fuel<00:00:57.860> the

various<00:02:05.590> settings<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.370> can<00:02:06.520> change<00:02:06.700> all

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
various settings which we can change all

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.190 
various settings which we can change all
the<00:02:07.150> settings<00:02:07.510> at<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.720> end<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.020> gauge

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the settings at the end of the gauge

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.590 
the settings at the end of the gauge
like<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:09.550> we've<00:02:09.700> got<00:02:09.820> map<00:02:10.000> sense<00:02:10.300> for

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
like this so we've got map sense for

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.450 
like this so we've got map sense for
example<00:02:10.660> where<00:02:11.260> we've<00:02:11.710> got<00:02:11.860> other<00:02:12.010> various

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
example where we've got other various

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.010 
example where we've got other various
readings<00:02:12.910> which<00:02:13.060> would<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:13.360> chained<00:02:13.600> everyone

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
readings which would be chained everyone

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.460 
readings which would be chained everyone
around

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
around

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.470 
around
we've<00:02:14.650> got<00:02:14.800> load<00:02:14.980> setting<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:15.730> we've<00:02:16.450> got

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
we've got load setting there we've got

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.600 
we've got load setting there we've got
throttle<00:02:16.930> position<00:02:17.020> there<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.370> make<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
throttle position there we can make a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.400 
throttle position there we can make a
lambda<00:02:18.910> we<00:02:19.210> can<00:02:19.240> measure<00:02:19.510> closed<00:02:19.870> loop<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.380> can

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
lambda we can measure closed loop we can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.250 
lambda we can measure closed loop we can
measure<00:02:20.680> ignition<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.660> brief<00:02:22.750> display

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
measure ignition so just a brief display

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.740 
measure ignition so just a brief display
there's<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.530> lot<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
there's a lot that you can do with that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
there's a lot that you can do with that
and<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:25.990> go<00:02:26.140> out<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.410> one<00:02:26.790> we've<00:02:27.790> got

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
and I can go out of that one we've got

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
and I can go out of that one we've got
our<00:02:28.060> trip<00:02:28.300> computer<00:02:28.660> there<00:02:29.040> which<00:02:30.040> will<00:02:30.220> give

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
our trip computer there which will give

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.340 
our trip computer there which will give
us<00:02:30.400> tank<00:02:30.790> values<00:02:31.240> what<00:02:31.600> everything's<00:02:32.020> going

us tank values what everything's going
on<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.620> turn<00:02:32.920> I've<00:02:33.220> actually<00:02:33.430> set<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> tank<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
on in turn I've actually set the tank to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.780 
on in turn I've actually set the tank to
12<00:02:34.570> gallons<00:02:34.990> on<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.320> one<00:02:35.530> let's<00:02:36.430> give<00:02:36.670> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the VIN number just very briefly if we

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.990 
the VIN number just very briefly if we
go<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:04.180> DT<00:03:04.570> seeds<00:03:05.400> I'll<00:03:06.400> try<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.760> read<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
go into DT seeds I'll try and read the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.750 
go into DT seeds I'll try and read the
DTC's<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.959> be<00:03:08.050> known<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.500> vehicle

and<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.030> back<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.480> now<00:03:10.830> okay<00:03:11.860> that's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
and we go back to now okay that's

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.340 
and we go back to now okay that's
actually<00:03:13.209> pretty<00:03:13.390> much<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.870> for<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.110> turbo

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
actually pretty much it for the turbo

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.930 
actually pretty much it for the turbo
code<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:14.799> very<00:03:14.860> easy<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.430> use<00:03:15.580> you'll<00:03:15.790> have
