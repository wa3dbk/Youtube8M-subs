00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the new looping pliers that we have from

Patti Bullard in her Webber's line if
you've<00:00:10.830> seen<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> Webber's<00:00:11.639> looping<00:00:12.450> pliers

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
you've seen the Webber's looping pliers

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.039 
you've seen the Webber's looping pliers
before<00:00:13.170> you've<00:00:13.920> seen<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> smaller<00:00:15.030> version<00:00:15.900> of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
before you've seen a smaller version of

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.910 
before you've seen a smaller version of
this<00:00:16.320> where<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.449> barrel<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this where you have this barrel and a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.490 
this where you have this barrel and a
channel<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:21.270> fit<00:00:21.750> together<00:00:21.960> very

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
channel and they fit together very

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.279 
channel and they fit together very
nicely<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.970> enough<00:00:24.300> room<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.600> wire<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
nicely with just enough room for wire to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:25.849 
nicely with just enough room for wire to
go<00:00:25.410> in

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

what<00:00:26.400> makes<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.180> set<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> pliers<00:00:27.750> different

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
what makes this set of pliers different

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.510 
what makes this set of pliers different
is<00:00:28.470> they're<00:00:29.160> larger<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> they're<00:00:30.840> ideal<00:00:31.289> for

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
is they're larger and they're ideal for

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
is they're larger and they're ideal for
18-gauge<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.420> I'll<00:00:33.540> show<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.140> works

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
18-gauge so I'll show you how this works

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
18-gauge so I'll show you how this works
now<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.190> liked<00:00:35.340> working<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.760> larger

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
now I have liked working with larger

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
now I have liked working with larger
gemstones<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> natural

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
gemstones and some of the natural

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.520 
gemstones and some of the natural
gemstones<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.610> quite<00:00:38.850> heavy<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.530> instead

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
gemstones can be quite heavy so instead

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
gemstones can be quite heavy so instead
of<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.980> making<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.460> single<00:00:41.670> loop<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.210> actually

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of just making a single loop I actually

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
of just making a single loop I actually
like<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> wrapped<00:00:43.559> loop<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.760> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like to do a wrapped loop for a lot of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
like to do a wrapped loop for a lot of
my<00:00:45.030> designs<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> first<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.950> I'm

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
my designs so the first thing that I'm

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
my designs so the first thing that I'm
going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.520> using<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.000> looping<00:00:48.390> pliers

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
going to do using these looping pliers

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.520 
going to do using these looping pliers
is<00:00:49.020> I'll<00:00:49.680> take<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:49.920> wire<00:00:50.250> again<00:00:51.320> I've<00:00:52.320> got<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
is I'll take my wire again I've got a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
is I'll take my wire again I've got a
glass<00:00:52.739> pearl<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.940> use<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.989> end<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
glass pearl to use on the end of this

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
glass pearl to use on the end of this
I'm<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> line<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.360> wire<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.260> I'm

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I'm going to line up my wire but I'm

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
I'm going to line up my wire but I'm
actually<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> come<00:00:59.699> down<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
actually going to come down a little bit

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
actually going to come down a little bit
on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.870> wire<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.309> inch

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
on the wire so I have about an inch

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.730 
on the wire so I have about an inch
hanging<00:01:03.359> off<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> side<00:01:04.040> give<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> squeeze

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
hanging off the side give that a squeeze

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
hanging off the side give that a squeeze
then<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> first<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.510> take

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
then the first thing I do I will take

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
then the first thing I do I will take
this<00:01:09.869> bottom<00:01:10.409> wire<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.830> still<00:01:11.040> connected

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this bottom wire that's still connected

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.460 
this bottom wire that's still connected
to<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.670> pool<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.439> bend<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.640> straight<00:01:14.640> down

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
to this pool and bend it straight down

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
to this pool and bend it straight down
then<00:01:16.470> I'll<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> top<00:01:17.189> wire<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.200> bend<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
then I'll take the top wire and bend it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
then I'll take the top wire and bend it
straight<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.310> meet<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.030> first<00:01:21.299> wire<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
straight down to meet the first wire I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.590 
straight down to meet the first wire I
will<00:01:22.970> readjust<00:01:23.970> my<00:01:24.060> grip<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:25.650> turn<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.159> pliers

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
will readjust my grip to turn my pliers

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
will readjust my grip to turn my pliers
horizontal<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> I'll<00:01:28.590> continue<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
horizontal and I'll continue take this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
horizontal and I'll continue take this
wrapping<00:01:30.270> wire<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.840> rest<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.470> over

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
wrapping wire the rest of the way over

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
wrapping wire the rest of the way over
so<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.250> makes<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.759> L<00:01:32.909> shape<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.810> while

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so it makes kind of an L shape so while

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
so it makes kind of an L shape so while
my<00:01:34.290> pliers<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:35.610> grab<00:01:35.850> my

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
my pliers are here that will grab my

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
my pliers are here that will grab my
chain<00:01:36.270> nose<00:01:36.479> pliers<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
chain nose pliers just so I can get a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
chain nose pliers just so I can get a
good<00:01:38.100> grip<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:39.030> wire<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.570> wrap<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
good grip on this wire and wrap it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.399 
good grip on this wire and wrap it
around<00:01:41.210> using<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.329> bent<00:01:42.689> chain<00:01:42.899> nose<00:01:42.960> pliers

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
around using my bent chain nose pliers

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.060 
around using my bent chain nose pliers
here<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.759> put<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.170> exactly<00:01:46.170> where<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
here to put this exactly where I want it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
here to put this exactly where I want it
to<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> cut<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to go and I'm just going to cut off that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.700 
to go and I'm just going to cut off that
little<00:01:49.380> end<00:01:50.479> I'm<00:01:51.479> using<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.140> side<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> my

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
little end I'm using the back side of my

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
little end I'm using the back side of my
flush<00:01:53.100> cutters<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> wire<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:55.020> be

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
flush cutters so that the wire will be

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.730 
flush cutters so that the wire will be
flat<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.189> end<00:01:56.899> pull<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
flat on that end pull that out I have a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.010 
flat on that end pull that out I have a
nice<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.189> loop<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.329> I'll<00:02:00.810> take<00:02:00.990> my

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
nice little loop so then I'll take my

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
nice little loop so then I'll take my
bead<00:02:01.409> slide<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> loop<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.820> I'm

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
bead slide it up to the loop and I'm

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880 
bead slide it up to the loop and I'm
going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> wrap<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.719> side<00:02:03.930> give<00:02:04.619> myself

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
going to wrap the other side give myself

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.089 
going to wrap the other side give myself
a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.390> space<00:02:06.689> between<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.860> bead

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
a little bit of a space between the bead

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.339 
a little bit of a space between the bead
and<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.580> pliers

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.059 

with<00:02:12.129> that<00:02:12.370> through<00:02:13.409> readjust<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:17.379> that<00:02:17.620> over

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
with that through readjust in that over

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.349 
with that through readjust in that over
hold<00:02:18.519> everything<00:02:19.260> steady<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:21.909> use<00:02:22.120> my

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
hold everything steady and I can use my

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.140 
hold everything steady and I can use my
hands<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.920> wrap<00:02:24.129> because<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> longer

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
hands to wrap because I have a longer

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.539 
hands to wrap because I have a longer
piece<00:02:25.359> to<00:02:25.510> hold<00:02:25.629> on<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.079> use<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.310> flush<00:02:27.760> cutters

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
piece to hold on to use my flush cutters

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.179 
piece to hold on to use my flush cutters
okay<00:02:30.549> there<00:02:31.359> you<00:02:31.389> go<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:32.379> loop<00:02:32.920> going

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
okay there you go I have one loop going

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.399 
okay there you go I have one loop going
this<00:02:33.730> way<00:02:33.969> and<00:02:34.269> this<00:02:34.719> loop<00:02:34.959> going<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.379> other

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
this way and this loop going the other

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.220 
this way and this loop going the other
way<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:36.010> can<00:02:36.670> make<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> neat<00:02:37.419> design<00:02:37.900> with

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
way I can make a neat design with

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.589 
way I can make a neat design with
alternating<00:02:38.650> loops<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:39.430> or<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.299> can

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
alternating loops like that or I can

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.679 
alternating loops like that or I can
just<00:02:40.629> take<00:02:40.840> my<00:02:40.989> chain<00:02:41.319> nose<00:02:41.499> pliers<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.340> twist

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
just take my chain nose pliers and twist

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.539 
just take my chain nose pliers and twist
it<00:02:43.689> around<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.709> they're<00:02:44.859> both<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.219> the<00:02:45.310> same

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
it around so they're both going the same

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.309 
it around so they're both going the same
direction<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> last<00:02:46.689> thing<00:02:46.900> I'm<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
direction so the last thing I'm going to

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.259 
direction so the last thing I'm going to
show<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.280> want<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.730> make<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.909> chain

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
show you is if you want to make a chain

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.080 
show you is if you want to make a chain
with<00:02:50.260> these<00:02:50.620> wrapped<00:02:50.919> loops<00:02:51.310> connecting<00:02:51.909> one

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
with these wrapped loops connecting one

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.059 
with these wrapped loops connecting one
to<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.389> other<00:02:52.569> one<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.889> do

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
to the other one way that you can do

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.360 
to the other one way that you can do
that<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.489> make<00:02:54.879> your<00:02:55.090> wrapped<00:02:55.329> loops<00:02:55.719> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that is you make your wrapped loops and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.679 
that is you make your wrapped loops and
connect<00:02:57.370> them<00:02:57.489> with<00:02:57.549> jump<00:02:57.909> rings<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.510> I've

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
connect them with jump rings like I've

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.890 
connect them with jump rings like I've
done<00:02:58.870> with<00:02:59.379> these<00:02:59.769> two<00:03:00.010> pieces<00:03:00.569> another<00:03:01.569> way

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
done with these two pieces another way

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.890 
done with these two pieces another way
that<00:03:02.199> you<00:03:02.469> can<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:02.949> that<00:03:03.159> is<00:03:03.449> before<00:03:04.449> you<00:03:04.599> close

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that you can do that is before you close

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800 
that you can do that is before you close
off<00:03:05.139> that<00:03:05.169> last<00:03:05.680> wrapped<00:03:06.189> loop<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:07.659> would

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
off that last wrapped loop you would

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.149 
off that last wrapped loop you would
join<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.199> to<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.409> next<00:03:08.769> one

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
join it to the next one

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.189 
join it to the next one
and<00:03:09.250> I'll<00:03:09.579> show<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.790> how<00:03:09.969> to<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.689> grab<00:03:11.079> my

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
and I'll show you how to do that grab my

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.289 
and I'll show you how to do that grab my
feet<00:03:11.439> and<00:03:11.680> slide<00:03:11.919> that<00:03:12.099> on<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:12.909> I<00:03:12.969> make<00:03:13.180> my

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
feet and slide that on and I make my

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.499 
feet and slide that on and I make my
first<00:03:13.540> loop<00:03:13.840> as<00:03:14.019> before<00:03:16.680> grab<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.889> end<00:03:18.479> so<00:03:19.479> I

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
first loop as before grab the end so I

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.300 
first loop as before grab the end so I
have<00:03:19.720> my<00:03:19.840> first<00:03:20.139> wrap<00:03:20.470> loop<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:20.949> we've<00:03:21.129> done

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
have my first wrap loop like we've done

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.759 
have my first wrap loop like we've done
before<00:03:21.599> cut<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.720> off<00:03:23.970> bring<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> bead<00:03:25.239> down

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
before cut that off bring the bead down

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.330 
before cut that off bring the bead down
I'm<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.979> to<00:03:27.069> cut<00:03:27.250> off<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> segment<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:30.220> I'm

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I'm going to cut off a segment so I'm

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.939 
I'm going to cut off a segment so I'm
going<00:03:30.669> to<00:03:30.849> have<00:03:31.659> two<00:03:31.959> before<00:03:32.349> I<00:03:32.379> close<00:03:32.680> this

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
going to have two before I close this

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.640 
going to have two before I close this
loop<00:03:33.280> slide<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.209> one<00:03:34.419> on<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.409> grab<00:03:35.620> my

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
loop slide this one on so I grab my

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.979 
loop slide this one on so I grab my
pliers<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:36.669> start<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.120> make<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.479> second

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
pliers and I start to make that second

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.670 
pliers and I start to make that second
loop<00:03:38.169> give<00:03:38.650> myself<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:39.129> little<00:03:39.159> bit<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.729> space

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
loop give myself a little bit of space

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.490 
loop give myself a little bit of space
readjust<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.299> crossover<00:03:43.299> then<00:03:44.049> I'm<00:03:44.199> going<00:03:44.439> to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
readjust and crossover then I'm going to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.439 
readjust and crossover then I'm going to
grab<00:03:44.620> my<00:03:44.829> bent<00:03:45.159> chain<00:03:45.400> nose<00:03:45.459> pliers<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.389> just

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
grab my bent chain nose pliers and just

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.800 
grab my bent chain nose pliers and just
open<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.650> up<00:03:48.189> so<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.120> there's<00:03:49.419> a<00:03:49.479> space

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
open that up so that there's a space

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.199 
open that up so that there's a space
then<00:03:50.259> I'll<00:03:50.379> take<00:03:50.620> my<00:03:50.919> other<00:03:51.489> wrapped<00:03:51.819> loop

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
then I'll take my other wrapped loop

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.289 
then I'll take my other wrapped loop
bead<00:03:53.009> now<00:03:54.009> I'm<00:03:54.370> not<00:03:54.639> going<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.939> have<00:03:55.060> enough

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
bead now I'm not going to have enough

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.689 
bead now I'm not going to have enough
room<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.810> put<00:03:56.469> my<00:03:56.500> loop<00:03:56.799> pliers<00:03:57.069> back<00:03:57.400> through

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
room to put my loop pliers back through

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.399 
room to put my loop pliers back through
so<00:03:58.000> I'll<00:03:58.090> use<00:03:58.359> my<00:03:58.509> chain<00:03:58.750> nose<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.229> rest

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
so I'll use my chain nose for the rest

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
just hold both sides of the loop steady

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.330

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
and continue the wrap so I can make an

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.199 
and continue the wrap so I can make an
entire<00:04:13.689> chain<00:04:14.109> with<00:04:14.379> beads<00:04:14.620> like<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:15.209> which

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
entire chain with beads like this which

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.870 
entire chain with beads like this which
is<00:04:16.389> one<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.659> my<00:04:16.780> favorite<00:04:17.139> things<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.530> do

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
is one of my favorite things to do

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.810 
is one of my favorite things to do
because<00:04:18.880> by<00:04:19.269> having<00:04:19.659> this<00:04:19.810> extra<00:04:20.199> bit<00:04:20.349> of<00:04:20.380> wire

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
because by having this extra bit of wire

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.100 
because by having this extra bit of wire
you're<00:04:21.820> still<00:04:22.120> getting<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.510> length<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.020> a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
you're still getting the length in a

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.879 
you're still getting the length in a
necklace<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.500> you'd<00:04:23.830> like

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
but you don't have as much weight so it

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.029 
but you don't have as much weight so it
makes<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.699> lot<00:04:28.819> easier<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.330> air<00:04:29.860> tuck<00:04:30.860> that
