 How are you going to spend it today? 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.480
 I would like to associate with my video again 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.440
 Recently there are many things that I recommend cutting off because of the recommendation of stupid hair 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:28.050
 This time, it's wood, and that 's what parts are all about 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.910
 Actually I talked about it last time , but I remember that there is a little bit of ne 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 I have to talk a little bit 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 I though is why do not I have to a little more story also always be in Acer 45 What 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 But it is 3415 years old 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.460
 Well Atojiyo Ji It is Ku'ema is it for this time is so I would be blue 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.110
 Flower 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 I say peg thread winding about this here 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.760
 This also found in hypocrisy continue to this story is I was there it is that you have to talk on the recommendation of the acoustic guitar 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.079
 But this hey peg 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.909
 Cat 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:05.330
 The so-called Crewson is a peg that substitutes Gibson's j 45 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.590
 I'd Tteyuu garter of pegs in and said, this white button white knobs 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 It though is Kaiserslautern with white knob This Gibson to say standing is Kuruson 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.320
 I think I'm probably making it 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.100
 It makes But I'm not anymore I long ago that say gibson deluxe really mad Son 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.810
 Based on the peg, you have a mo girl 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 Very This vintage Affleck also but I'm a mean there is reproduced peg Te 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 It's full of vintage flavors 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.850
 It's a feeling, but in the old pegs there are a lot of things like this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.119
 What 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 For example I Toka or comes with a small plastic sac knob 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.170
 Well with things such small clogging but is well translation was or there is made of metal 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.540
 Are 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 Well the real though I think I come I also people who likes this peg gold cat Bae 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.640
 Gu also said 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.840
 Well there are various kinds of pegs , and then I introduce them while thinking that I compared them . 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.829
 But there is such a big peg of the knob 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.909
 There are 5 of them here in Japan. We are proud of Japan. 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:03.399
 Wow really peg of Goto's order company is making that Goto 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:06.909
 Wonderful say that is equipped with a sound that elaborate the tuning function 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.860
 What it, but has been very said performance event 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.670
 is It would be a good high tendency operability because ok tsunami 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.450
 Something is amazing small little while ago of Kuruson vector I think I'm also because consensus-building easy 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.960
 I so 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.820
 Certainly it looks nice but it's hard to turn it a little 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.950
 I do not have to 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.580
 But although this knob It is a big And this is a metal knob is what 1 radish 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.900
 This is actually 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.260
 Well, this time I'm introducing these two pegs for a while, but this is also 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.670
 This I I I has seen this it a little strange it is attached to the head 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:44.890
 This is a new peg with just eyes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.170
 Real I also depending on the material and serves as the magnitude of this I peg Datte small peak is precisely the sound 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.569
 It seems that there is a story that comes different 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.400
 For example 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:57.439
 But I was introduced that this ne while ago now be made of metal in Pocky eyes of the peg of this Okkii 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.700
 But recently some sort of pegs like this have been added to meet the needs of the highland example 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.379
 I think though 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.340
 It's heavy , but it's a bit heavy compared to the usual Gibson 's. 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.560
 It is peg 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.900
 Say However, I and Chinami is a good large minute operability 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.490
 Heavenly Territories are very good, but it's too heavy to have a sound . 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.350
 It'll keep the pressurized system I very much I'm like a or become sound to take minor 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.340
 The Tteyuu that larger pegs say that seems spits out the kind of sound and 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.910
 The opposite of the cat 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.970
 A fancy peg with a plastic pan knob 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.080
 Although it is a peg with a plastic sound knob 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.760
 Well this something You're Oh knob is it so very plastic era 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.060
 There is a thing that that is very light, and it is said that the sound is also very good 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.630
 Or rather that becomes very sound of Me high light so much this 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.740
 That guitar 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.430
 It seems that there is such a story that does not affect the vibration something 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.810
 Let's go very much 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.709
 That's why Caramel Peg is so good and sounds like that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.299
 I will give you 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:04.109
 3 There is a thing that power is transmitted, but sometimes it is very useful. 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.810
 It's also awkward to say that it is quite difficult to play 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.770
 Well 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:14.450
 It is that I this say hard to be a little ne repair 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:17.690
 Screws for registration adjustment of I'd seen and you'll see something peg of Tagami that is attached 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.290
 And that the US military's surroundings got a little worse 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.590
 I'm looking at this plus driver, but this kind of image 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.800
 If you adjust something, you may get better 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.389
 I just to this this everyone 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.409
 Don't follow me, don't follow me peg 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.940
 It is easy to per Well 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:38.689
 I So I gradually Nde thing to get was either do What pegs what need to replace me this is Well 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.649
 Also be set to any kind in either Baek 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.909
 I like do not, unless otherwise exchange this kind of guess that the other immediately but I'm required 

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:47.299
 There is also a risk 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:52.819
 So I say I take the Which guess I'd think is a very difficult 

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:57.289
 From the eyes that I had, then I made it high and I always choose 4 to choose 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.680
 So you have a bigger knob for the first time than the smaller one 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.180
 After all I want to choose a school 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.229
 Or some people say'm also I like very much closed How do I but hot knob talent a place 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.070
 I think so 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.340
 Then, if it affects the sound, it is something like this plastic family 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.610
 Makes knob is better that the good of the so-called pincushion of 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.200
 You might also there if you or I wonder if the better of the effect 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:23.150
 I When Well this is a bit Strictly speaking 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.930
 I also do not know the body of the guitar than it is rather pegs 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.620
 The entire 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.340
 Because short of that guitar sound body says Evamono 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.480
 And say which way do I's why I think the kana not that what should be the judge over there 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.129
 So I do not choose a good operability p 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.309
 Well this is on a smaller peg , though 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:48.249
 So I after all this I Okki Me peg 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:50.019
 Towards the operation of the I This peg versatile is Well sound I will or I thought I wonder if I love 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.159
 But I heard tight exits 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:55.080
 I'm a not to be or not Wakan a little hard to be me I'll Hen shell pretty well 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:00.060
 but 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:05.189
 It 's kind of a peg like this peg like this I like ok eyes 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.879
 It was Tari and Kedomo many kinds of is why there Daegu Baek is a difference in sound alone peg 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:12.659
 I told you that there was a story 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:15.100
 Well , I think it would be appreciated if this could be one reference 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.970
 Case also was a cage t's that I'll see you next time 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.970
 I do not like it
