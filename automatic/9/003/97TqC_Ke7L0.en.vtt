okay oh the compass is pointing you to
where<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.670> needs<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.060> oh<00:02:49.420> that's<00:02:49.990> pretty

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
where it needs to be oh that's pretty

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.370 
where it needs to be oh that's pretty
awesome<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.800> at<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> spawn<00:02:51.250> point<00:02:52.380> not

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
awesome so it's at the spawn point not

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.980 
awesome so it's at the spawn point not
that<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.680> need<00:02:53.920> any<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.880> supplies<00:02:55.360> but

either<00:03:58.660> way<00:04:00.240> golden<00:04:01.240> pickaxe<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.920> break

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
either way golden pickaxe can break

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:13.710 
either way golden pickaxe can break
stone<00:04:06.870> there<00:04:07.870> was<00:04:08.020> stone<00:04:11.700> down<00:04:12.700> here<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:13.600> that

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
stone there was stone down here is that

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.180 
stone there was stone down here is that
the<00:04:13.840> only<00:04:13.989> stone<00:04:14.440> fire<00:04:15.340> fire<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.890> can't

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
the only stone fire fire and I can't

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.890 
the only stone fire fire and I can't
stop<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.760> fire<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.479> it's<00:04:19.600> got<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.840> be

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
stop the fire so it's got to be

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.100 
stop the fire so it's got to be
somewhere<00:04:20.169> around<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.620> fire<00:04:20.979> right

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.690 

and<00:04:28.110> then<00:04:30.350> ok<00:04:31.350> that's<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.830> oh<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.160> maybe<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.610> was

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
and then ok that's the oh so maybe I was

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.750 
and then ok that's the oh so maybe I was
just<00:04:32.730> supposed<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.120> move<00:04:33.210> forward<00:04:34.640> so<00:04:35.640> I'm

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
just supposed to move forward so I'm

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.620 
just supposed to move forward so I'm
assuming<00:04:35.880> underneath<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.840> fire<00:04:38.300> there<00:04:39.300> we<00:04:39.450> go

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
assuming underneath the fire there we go

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.490 
assuming underneath the fire there we go
more<00:04:40.530> dirt<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.220> getting<00:04:41.940> there<00:04:45.500> you're

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
more dirt and getting there you're

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.110 
more dirt and getting there you're
getting<00:04:46.590> there<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.190> next<00:04:47.310> thing<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.640> under

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
getting there the next thing is under

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.340

the<00:06:46.489> stack<00:06:46.729> of<00:06:46.909> command<00:06:47.209> blocks<00:06:47.449> they<00:06:47.659> must

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:47.839 
the stack of command blocks they must

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.569 
the stack of command blocks they must
have<00:06:47.959> gone<00:06:48.229> away<00:06:48.439> let's<00:06:49.069> take<00:06:49.129> a<00:06:49.219> look<00:06:49.369> at<00:06:49.489> this

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579 
have gone away let's take a look at this

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:54.069 
have gone away let's take a look at this
thing<00:06:51.519> so<00:06:52.519> it<00:06:52.609> puts<00:06:52.789> you<00:06:52.849> up<00:06:52.939> in<00:06:53.029> the<00:06:53.119> sky<00:06:53.389> okay

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:54.079 
thing so it puts you up in the sky okay

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.959 
thing so it puts you up in the sky okay
so<00:06:54.559> that's<00:06:54.769> how<00:06:54.919> that<00:06:54.979> works<00:06:55.189> so<00:06:55.549> it<00:06:55.669> doesn't

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:55.969 
so that's how that works so it doesn't

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.969 
so that's how that works so it doesn't
take<00:06:56.119> nearly<00:06:56.329> as<00:06:56.539> much<00:06:56.689> space<00:06:56.929> is<00:06:57.199> it<00:06:57.349> as<00:06:57.499> it

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
take nearly as much space is it as it

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.649 
take nearly as much space is it as it
seems<00:06:58.219> that<00:06:58.339> it<00:06:58.429> would<00:06:58.549> have<00:06:58.669> first<00:06:58.879> and<00:06:59.089> it

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
seems that it would have first and it

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.869 
seems that it would have first and it
must<00:06:59.929> throw<00:07:00.199> you<00:07:00.259> new<00:07:00.559> adventure<00:07:01.219> mode<00:07:01.399> so<00:07:01.849> i

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 
must throw you new adventure mode so i

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.399 
must throw you new adventure mode so i
