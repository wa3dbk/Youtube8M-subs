00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
recommend playing the pits because it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.749 
recommend playing the pits because it's
the<00:01:16.110> fastest<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> probably<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> easiest

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the fastest one and probably the easiest

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
the fastest one and probably the easiest
one<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> fast<00:01:19.020> forward<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.530> because

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
one now I fast forward it here because

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.410 
one now I fast forward it here because
I'm<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.820> bad<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I'm really bad at this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
I'm really bad at this
so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.500> fostered<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> will

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
so I fostered it and then as you will

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
so I fostered it and then as you will
see<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> end<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.930> me<00:01:25.770> playing<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.400> will

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
see at the end of me playing this I will

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.410 
see at the end of me playing this I will
get<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> trophies

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.300
