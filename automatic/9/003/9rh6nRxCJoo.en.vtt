 upper and lower matching 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.750
 the replacement was in chickens 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.410
 installation of flame arrester on the car 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.410
 nissan tino 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.530
 on this car 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.380
 reception pipes are attached smoothly 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.590
 the collector and the two places are all two ends 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.850
 reunions are given there their 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.850
 connection of receiving pipes 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.900
 free system is cut for

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.290
 to preserve the diameter of the structure 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.290
 welded retainer 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.360
 then the old gopro is finally a breeze 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.360
 this system 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:41.819
 her place is set by a new gopro

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 I roll 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.080
 to cut the second letter 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.080
 the lock is also welded

 2 2 blocks cuts out from the system 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.250
 in its place will also be installed a new 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.250
 log on keeping track 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.980

 old catalyst is cut 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.979
 when 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:30.969

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:30.969
 regular place is fixed on the damper 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:43.170
 instead of the catalyst are installed 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:47.660

 conditional made of stainless steel 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.980
 flame arrester compound rolls down 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.620
 then the finished system and them from cereals 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.949
 but dokoka and flame arrester sets 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.110
 to a regular place 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.590
 large reception are fixed one

 pipe resonator ache 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.660
 repair is over warranty on everything 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.950
