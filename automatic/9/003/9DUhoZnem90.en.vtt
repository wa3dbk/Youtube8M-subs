00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there's various various levels there is

there's various various levels there is
a<00:00:28.680> tutorial<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.760> teach<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
a tutorial which will teach you what to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.400 
a tutorial which will teach you what to
do<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.750> fairly<00:00:31.289> straightforward<00:00:36.410> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
do but it's fairly straightforward and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.040 
do but it's fairly straightforward and
as<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:38.180> there's<00:00:39.180> plenty<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> other

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
as you can see there's plenty of other

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.910 
as you can see there's plenty of other
levels<00:00:40.500> within<00:00:40.710> each<00:00:41.550> sector<00:00:42.059> 22<00:00:42.570> unlock

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
levels within each sector 22 unlock

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
levels within each sector 22 unlock
you've<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.129> lives<00:00:44.309> top<00:00:44.670> left-hand<00:00:45.030> side

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you've got your lives top left-hand side

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.560 
you've got your lives top left-hand side
so<00:00:45.899> essentially<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
so essentially what you have to do is

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.040 
so essentially what you have to do is
land<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> aircraft<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> corresponding

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
land the aircraft in the corresponding

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
land the aircraft in the corresponding
colored<00:00:52.440> ports<00:00:53.300> now<00:00:54.300> obviously<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.629> two

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
colored ports now obviously if two

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
colored ports now obviously if two
aircrafts<00:00:55.559> Clyde<00:00:55.829> you're<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> lose<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
aircrafts Clyde you're going to lose a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.430 
aircrafts Clyde you're going to lose a
lie

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:10.330 

it<00:01:00.980> was<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.129> little<00:01:01.250> coin<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:07.900> however<00:01:09.340> things

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
it was a little coin now however things

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.820 
it was a little coin now however things
do<00:01:10.909> spice<00:01:11.630> up<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.930> little<00:01:12.140> bit<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:14.619> what<00:01:15.619> I'll<00:01:15.710> do

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
do spice up a little bit so what I'll do

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.800 
do spice up a little bit so what I'll do
I'll<00:01:15.979> carry<00:01:16.220> on<00:01:16.310> playing<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:17.330> I<00:01:17.420> edit

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
I'll carry on playing and then I edit

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.460 
I'll carry on playing and then I edit
the<00:01:17.899> video<00:01:18.140> when<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.409> comes<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> good<00:01:18.890> bit<00:01:26.470> as

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
the video when it comes to a good bit as

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.609 
the video when it comes to a good bit as
you<00:01:27.590> see<00:01:27.770> here<00:01:27.979> we've<00:01:28.190> got<00:01:28.220> for<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:30.440> yellow

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
you see here we've got for the yellow

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
you see here we've got for the yellow
ones<00:01:30.830> in<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.100> row<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.490> they<00:01:31.580> follow<00:01:31.789> each<00:01:31.850> other

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
ones in a row and they follow each other

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.490 
ones in a row and they follow each other
so<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.390> only<00:01:32.539> need<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.750> guide<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.110> first<00:01:33.320> one

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
so you only need to guide the first one

00:01:33.500 --> 00:02:04.779 
so you only need to guide the first one
in<00:02:02.950> oops-a-daisy<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.489> then<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.759> a

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
in oops-a-daisy and then we have a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.089 
in oops-a-daisy and then we have a
collegiate<00:02:05.149> collision<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:05.929> we're<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:06.890> lose<00:02:07.069> a

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
collegiate collision so we're we lose a

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:20.130 
collegiate collision so we're we lose a
life<00:02:07.340> there

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:45.050 

I<00:02:35.760> thought<00:02:36.760> there's<00:02:36.940> too<00:02:37.060> many<00:02:37.150> green<00:02:37.450> ones

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.550 

now<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.660> another<00:02:46.840> ship<00:02:47.080> coming<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.470> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
now it's another ship coming here and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
now it's another ship coming here and
this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.709> ready<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.190> rip<00:02:48.430> one<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.850> what<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.030> need

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
this is ready to rip one so what we need

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.449 
this is ready to rip one so what we need
to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.709> unload<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.890> cargo<00:02:51.750> from<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> ship

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to do is unload the cargo from the ship

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:02.550 
to do is unload the cargo from the ship
get<00:02:54.459> them<00:02:54.580> all<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.730> there<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:02.260> often<00:03:02.380> get

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
get them all in there but we often get

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.979 
get them all in there but we often get
too<00:03:02.800> close<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.190> each<00:03:03.280> other<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.670> wise<00:03:03.989> will

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
too close to each other and wise will

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.259 
too close to each other and wise will
end<00:03:05.110> up<00:03:05.230> with<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.410> crash<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.239> go

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
end up with a crash and there we go

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.580 
end up with a crash and there we go
