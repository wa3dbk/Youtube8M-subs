00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.569
 welcome to my favorite game as 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.210
 you can see is a game of 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.460
 black ops a domain in act even my map 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.950
 preferred that is the perfect game 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.220
 guys favorite game map favorite weapon 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.750
 good favorite in that you have to disagree 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.670
 As you can see I have the house 74 with 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.410
 silencer I put an example and 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.450
 fast camera because it 's a bit long 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.890
 be warned you it is a bit long still 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.620
 putting in slow motion hard five 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.140
 Minutitos and good in today's gameplay 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.660
 I will explain more or less why to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.640
 me for me this is my favorite game since 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.390
 that I have enough reasons to see if it is 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.739
 with mexico 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.670
 you buy it and we are a 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.800
 game together good to start I'll 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.999
 to talk a little before the game is 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.800
 a game that you have already started 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.880
 pretty bad but then I take out my 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.250
 gusts the kiwi 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.110
 the dogs and the black bird and I'm staying 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.490
 like two or three times to one of blackbio 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.170
 again once you take out your chin 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.270
 you know that the kiwi have it insured 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.040
 because the black bird is so that it does not 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.050
 know 1 constant av as a vee 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.130
 advanced but that is what all the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.570
 long so you do not have to pass the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.790
 bar to mark where is the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.660
 enemy 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 and well tomorrow I will also upload a 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.610
 tutorial I will have uploaded it before yesterday 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 I had uploaded a tutorial on how to upload 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.290
 fast number warfare 3 levels 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.460
 not knowing what you think since I was 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.530
 prestige 14 in play and in estella soy 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 prestige one almost two as well as nothing 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.340
 I'll throw a cable to the ones that cost you the most 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.260
 level up since I like it 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.110
 help you all and well let's go 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.750
 to start white is my favorite game 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 can you watch me imagine a friend 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.070
 I do not know how old I would have the truth 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.310
 but he came to the store to a game to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.810
 be more accurate by advertising 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.430
 he has a store the game had me 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.740
 bought the playstation3 made a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.060
 week and I did not have any games like that but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.620
 one that came with the play that I did not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.479
 I remember the name, you can believe that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.520
 I do not remember the first name the first 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.200
 game that I had from play 3 I think it was the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.060
 and the game of dragons that I sold it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.680
 all because he was a pain in the ass 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.400
 giant 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.399
 and well I arrived and saw the black ops via 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.620
 that guy so strong the cover with the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 two pipes with salt and with chalice and he called me 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.360
 much attention he knew that the last 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.850
 call of duty and good I decided I decided 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.950
 buy and from my house I started to try and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.260
 well you know the typical do not start 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.610
 play to play to play and we go 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.860
 that you are all bad because you have not 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.180
 played a caldito in your life you have 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 played at colleagues house to the modern 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 warfare2 but well you have not either 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.550
 played a lot called us then good 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 he came to my house I put him in the play a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.320
 amazing game pass with my fame 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.930
 red dot in order typical of what you 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.030
 you put at the beginning the first weapon that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.730
 I loved it was not you are going to believe it was 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.680
 the Czech 21 the truth is that I 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.959
 I loved a lot that weapon I put 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.239
 red dot was going to tremendously well 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.670
 and I with this connection with this bad 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.910
 the collision that used to be in black ops 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.770
 and you had about 10 megabytes one thing if not 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 killed quite then unlock the rp 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.410
 here and life has already sunk because I 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.680
 I put it because I said it had more damage 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.450
 and proved that it was a slop then 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.130
 good black ops as I leave it 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 abandoned me I got zombies I started to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.960
 progress a lot when it comes to moving around 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.880
 the maps go on the one hand for another and 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.100
 I went online and online, because 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.840
 it's true that I started doing it a lot 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.090
 better I watched videos on youtube of people 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.520
 how I played there is like when I started 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.140
 I started to get into the world of 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.730
 youtube to upload videos and that's still not 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.170
 I started uploading videos but come on I saw 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.260
 the people who brought them up who commented 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.150
 and willy kings richard hands all this 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.440
 people and the truth is that it is a world with 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.530
 it attracted but good I the videos the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.630
 used to learn to play well total 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.090
 that made me games very good that I 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.170
 I would like prestige 34 I stayed at 5 in 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.970
 play and in this I'm at level 37 38 almost 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.190
 he aimed to unlock the 47 that is my weapon 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.450
 favorite and good is a game that does not 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.730
 it's wasted a lot of people say that 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.710
 it's cartoon but I do not 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.680
 I see the cartoons to see this map 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.780
 I know it's a bit weird so to speak 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.830
 but let's go to me is a game that I 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 love 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.210
 totally is one of my favorites and 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.890
 Carlos DÃ­ez and favorites without a doubt 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.280
 I know the streak is very well done 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.470
 there is nothing like mortars 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.330
 maybe but let's say there's nothing 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.210
 gusts of help or anything like that the only 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.010
 that fails maybe the host is if it puts you 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.570
 a host guiri it is impossible for you to kill 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.790
 not be a camper to another level 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.110
 you have to change a lot to see 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.009
 what can you other good games with a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.869
 game to follow and yes of course yes but 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.339
 you will not compare me to being a host 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:36.409
 Spanish that without an eye if you can go 

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.830
 much faster as I like 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.270
 you are seeing the truth is that I do not know 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.249
 over that is my favorite map I have not 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.259
 done the result is a 60 20 one thing 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.939
 So says another day and die guasch the 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.039
 I'm going to go up because I do not know I feel like it 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.039
 very much to upload a 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.250
 they went up to a game of whites like that 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.660
 you know 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.390
 I think it's the first one that I upload to the channel 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.160
 in hd if I'm not wrong I think so 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.630

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.240
 have also liked this game so much 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.980
 like me I do not know me is that I love 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.900
 guys the truth the weapons are very 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.030
 well compensated no equal area 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.800
 they all sound different between the mode 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.750
 zombies the truth is that it is a game that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.160
 I love I have lots of friends with 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.690
 the same as me that is a pass from 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.910
 game that is amazing is better than what 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.620
 criticism in played neither with four nor 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.030
 modern warfare white guys black ops 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.530
