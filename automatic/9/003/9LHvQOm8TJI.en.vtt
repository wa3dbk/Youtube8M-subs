in<00:00:04.900> this<00:00:05.020> video<00:00:05.230> we're<00:00:05.890> gonna<00:00:05.950> take<00:00:06.250> a<00:00:06.310> look<00:00:06.520> at

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
in this video we're gonna take a look at

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.170 
in this video we're gonna take a look at
a<00:00:06.700> few<00:00:07.120> of<00:00:07.300> the<00:00:07.450> case<00:00:08.010> options<00:00:09.010> I<00:00:09.250> use<00:00:09.549> for<00:00:10.000> my

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
a few of the case options I use for my

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.779 
a few of the case options I use for my
dais<00:00:10.990> remote<00:00:11.410> now<00:00:11.920> when<00:00:12.190> I<00:00:12.219> say<00:00:12.430> the<00:00:12.520> remote

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
dais remote now when I say the remote

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.879 
dais remote now when I say the remote
I'm<00:00:13.000> referring<00:00:13.360> of<00:00:13.480> course<00:00:13.539> to<00:00:13.780> the<00:00:14.020> control

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
I'm referring of course to the control

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.730 
I'm referring of course to the control
unit<00:00:14.920> here<00:00:15.430> which<00:00:15.670> is<00:00:15.990> pretty<00:00:16.990> much<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.590> most

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
unit here which is pretty much the most

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.830 
unit here which is pretty much the most
expensive<00:00:18.430> part<00:00:18.670> of<00:00:18.760> this<00:00:18.910> detector<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.510> think

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
expensive part of this detector I think

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840 
expensive part of this detector I think
it<00:00:19.930> cost<00:00:20.200> about<00:00:20.560> seven<00:00:21.550> eight<00:00:21.700> hundred

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
it cost about seven eight hundred

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
it cost about seven eight hundred
dollars<00:00:22.330> to<00:00:22.510> replace<00:00:22.900> so<00:00:24.060> obviously<00:00:25.060> I'm

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
dollars to replace so obviously I'm

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.960 
dollars to replace so obviously I'm
concerned<00:00:26.560> about<00:00:26.830> protecting<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.610> because

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
concerned about protecting that because

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.750 
concerned about protecting that because
I<00:00:28.000> really<00:00:28.690> don't<00:00:28.900> want<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.230> shell<00:00:29.560> out<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
I really don't want it to shell out you

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.279 
I really don't want it to shell out you
know<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:31.090> much<00:00:31.300> money<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.810> have<00:00:32.259> that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
know that much money to have that

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.680 
know that much money to have that
replaced<00:00:32.829> obviously<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:33.699> could<00:00:33.850> still<00:00:34.360> run<00:00:34.539> the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
replaced obviously I could still run the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.710 
replaced obviously I could still run the
detector<00:00:35.199> with<00:00:35.350> my<00:00:35.880> headphones<00:00:36.880> but<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.660> know

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
detector with my headphones but you know

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.229 
detector with my headphones but you know
I'd<00:00:38.200> much<00:00:38.500> rather<00:00:38.530> have<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.940> keep<00:00:40.090> this

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
I'd much rather have this and keep this

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
I'd much rather have this and keep this
nice<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.910> first<00:00:43.149> thing<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.420> got<00:00:43.600> was<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
nice so the first thing I got was the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.710 
nice so the first thing I got was the
dais<00:00:46.390> branded<00:00:47.070> silicone<00:00:48.070> cover<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.180> you<00:00:49.660> know

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
dais branded silicone cover and you know

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.680 
dais branded silicone cover and you know
this<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.110> pretty<00:00:50.380> nice<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:50.920> definitely<00:00:51.690> able

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
this is pretty nice it's definitely able

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.889 
this is pretty nice it's definitely able
to<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.489> know<00:00:54.579> absorb<00:00:54.940> some<00:00:55.149> shock<00:00:55.420> if<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.780> were

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
to you know absorb some shock if it were

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.840 
to you know absorb some shock if it were
to<00:00:56.079> fall<00:00:56.110> it's<00:00:56.890> pretty<00:00:57.130> thick<00:00:58.950> it<00:00:59.950> is<00:01:00.010> silicone

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
to fall it's pretty thick it is silicone

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.139 
to fall it's pretty thick it is silicone
so<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.480> gonna<00:01:01.719> get<00:01:02.020> pretty<00:01:03.010> dirty<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.640> dusty

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
so it's gonna get pretty dirty and dusty

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.039 
so it's gonna get pretty dirty and dusty
fairly<00:01:04.960> easy<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.790> mean<00:01:07.149> not<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.450> big<00:01:07.659> deal<00:01:07.840> to

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
fairly easy so I mean not a big deal to

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.779 
fairly easy so I mean not a big deal to
take<00:01:08.649> it<00:01:08.770> off<00:01:08.889> at<00:01:09.069> the<00:01:09.159> end<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.459> day<00:01:09.609> and

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
take it off at the end of the day and

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.279 
take it off at the end of the day and
rinse<00:01:10.149> it<00:01:10.299> off<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.689> you're<00:01:10.840> concerned<00:01:11.170> about

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
rinse it off if you're concerned about

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.449 
rinse it off if you're concerned about
that<00:01:12.209> it<00:01:13.209> can<00:01:13.479> be<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.659> little<00:01:13.929> difficult<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.950> fit

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 
that it can be a little difficult to fit

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.699 
that it can be a little difficult to fit
in<00:01:15.609> there<00:01:15.880> because<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.780> sticks<00:01:17.170> against<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
in there because it sticks against the

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.440 
in there because it sticks against the
glossiness<00:01:18.219> of<00:01:18.609> the<00:01:18.819> control<00:01:20.399> but<00:01:21.399> so<00:01:21.999> yeah

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
glossiness of the control but so yeah

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.249 
glossiness of the control but so yeah
this<00:01:22.659> would<00:01:22.869> be<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:24.100> my<00:01:24.340> general<00:01:24.609> everyday

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this would be just my general everyday

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.289 
this would be just my general everyday
nice<00:01:26.259> weather<00:01:26.619> hunting<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.520> would<00:01:27.850> probably

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
nice weather hunting I would probably

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.080 
nice weather hunting I would probably
throw<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.569> in<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:29.310> you'll<00:01:30.310> notice<00:01:30.639> on<00:01:30.819> back

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
throw it in this you'll notice on back

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.749 
throw it in this you'll notice on back
it<00:01:31.299> has<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.479> couple<00:01:31.779> holes<00:01:32.139> here<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
it has a couple holes here the the

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.300 
it has a couple holes here the the
bottom<00:01:34.029> hole<00:01:34.209> to<00:01:34.630> attach<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.679> shaft<00:01:35.950> and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
bottom hole to attach to the shaft and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.169 
bottom hole to attach to the shaft and
then<00:01:36.819> this<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.659> square<00:01:37.899> hole<00:01:38.200> which<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:40.060> know

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
then this the square hole which you know

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.059 
then this the square hole which you know
allows<00:01:40.389> the<00:01:40.689> speaker<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.499> come<00:01:41.679> through<00:01:41.889> a

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
allows the speaker to come through a

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.279 
allows the speaker to come through a
little<00:01:42.369> clearer<00:01:42.609> I<00:01:42.819> kind<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.689> wish<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.869> didn't

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
little clearer I kind of wish it didn't

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.429 
little clearer I kind of wish it didn't
have<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:44.829> opening<00:01:45.609> because<00:01:45.969> I<00:01:46.450> guess<00:01:47.109> if<00:01:47.289> I'm

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
have that opening because I guess if I'm

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.429 
have that opening because I guess if I'm
using<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.919> cover<00:01:48.729> out<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:50.109> know<00:01:50.349> it

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
using this cover out and and you know it

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.589 
using this cover out and and you know it
starts<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.799> rain<00:01:50.979> there's<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:51.939> chance<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.419> uh

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
starts to rain there's a chance that uh

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.999 
starts to rain there's a chance that uh
rain<00:01:53.590> could<00:01:53.859> water<00:01:54.459> could<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.329> those

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
rain could water could get in those

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.159 
rain could water could get in those
speaker<00:01:57.009> slots<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.569> know<00:01:58.689> caused<00:01:58.959> some

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.169 
speaker slots and you know caused some

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:03.029 
speaker slots and you know caused some
damage<00:01:59.919> and<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.489> would<00:02:00.639> definitely<00:02:01.709> ruin<00:02:02.709> my

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
damage and that would definitely ruin my

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.499 
damage and that would definitely ruin my
day<00:02:03.099> so<00:02:03.539> yeah<00:02:04.539> if<00:02:05.279> I'm<00:02:06.279> not<00:02:06.549> near<00:02:06.880> anybody's<00:02:07.389> of

nice day than this
what<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.130> use<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:14.590> there's<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.680> chance<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.870> you

what I use if there's a chance that you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.720 
what I use if there's a chance that you
know<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.500> could<00:02:18.680> rain<00:02:18.920> or<00:02:19.220> I'm<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:19.490> be

near<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.270> do<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.600> lot<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.810> hunting<00:02:21.200> near<00:02:22.010> rivers<00:02:22.430> I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
near I do a lot of hunting near rivers I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.890 
near I do a lot of hunting near rivers I
picked<00:02:23.569> up<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.930> case<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.040> raikou<00:02:25.490> wave<00:02:26.060> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
picked up this case in a raikou wave it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.729 
picked up this case in a raikou wave it
is<00:02:27.520> waterproof<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:29.140> ninety<00:02:30.140> feet<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> got

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
is waterproof to ninety feet and I got

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.380 
is waterproof to ninety feet and I got
the<00:02:30.860> idea<00:02:31.130> from<00:02:32.020> another<00:02:33.020> video<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.440> saw<00:02:34.390> they

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
the idea from another video I saw they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.809 
the idea from another video I saw they
used<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.780> bigger<00:02:36.440> version<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.160> case<00:02:37.459> I

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
used a bigger version of this case I

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.340 
used a bigger version of this case I
like<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:41.060> version<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:41.630> for<00:02:41.870> an

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
like this this version that's for an

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.310 
like this this version that's for an
iPhone<00:02:42.830> 4<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.630> get<00:02:44.810> them<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> lot

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
iPhone 4 because you can get them a lot

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.530 
iPhone 4 because you can get them a lot
cheaper<00:02:45.620> because<00:02:46.010> obviously<00:02:46.360> most<00:02:47.360> people

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
cheaper because obviously most people

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.540 
cheaper because obviously most people
are<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.050> with<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.590> larger<00:02:48.980> phones<00:02:49.220> you

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
are going with the larger phones you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.900 
are going with the larger phones you
know<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> 5<00:02:50.209> inch<00:02:50.420> iPhone<00:02:51.410> 5<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
know like the 5 inch iPhone 5 and the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.770 
know like the 5 inch iPhone 5 and the
Samsung<00:02:53.900> phones<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.850> know<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.150> think<00:02:56.420> on

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
Samsung phones so you know I think on

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.100 
Samsung phones so you know I think on
eBay<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:59.030> looked<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.840> get<00:02:59.959> this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
eBay I just looked and you can get this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.830 
eBay I just looked and you can get this
for<00:03:00.290> about<00:03:00.380> $15<00:03:01.340> shipped

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
for about $15 shipped

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.390 
for about $15 shipped
where<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.290> know<00:03:03.410> full<00:03:03.650> retail<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.280> is

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
where you know full retail I think is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.140 
where you know full retail I think is
around<00:03:04.640> 30<00:03:04.910> or<00:03:05.000> 40<00:03:06.310> basically<00:03:07.310> what<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:07.760> case

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
around 30 or 40 basically what this case

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.729 
around 30 or 40 basically what this case
does<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.750> haven't<00:03:09.019> seen<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.319> other<00:03:09.410> video

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
does if you haven't seen the other video

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.479 
does if you haven't seen the other video
it<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.400> completely<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.810> totally<00:03:11.989> waterproof

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
it is completely and totally waterproof

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.750 
it is completely and totally waterproof
dustproof<00:03:13.489> sand<00:03:14.450> proof<00:03:14.690> whatever<00:03:15.459> yet<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.579> has

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
dustproof sand proof whatever yet it has

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.550 
dustproof sand proof whatever yet it has
this<00:03:17.030> silicon<00:03:18.019> layer<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.350> push

still easily pressed and completely safe

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.390 
still easily pressed and completely safe
from<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.630> elements<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:45.109> this<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.980> it's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
from the elements in this and it's it's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.780 
from the elements in this and it's it's
really<00:03:49.670> nice<00:03:49.820> for<00:03:50.780> yeah<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.890> 15<00:03:52.190> bucks<00:03:52.400> really

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
really nice for yeah for 15 bucks really

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.550 
really nice for yeah for 15 bucks really
I<00:03:52.970> mean<00:03:53.540> why<00:03:53.750> not<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.560> protection<00:03:56.560> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
I mean why not have that protection the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.199 
I mean why not have that protection the
only<00:03:57.739> problem<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.130> attaching<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.090> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
only problem is attaching it to the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.970 
only problem is attaching it to the
shaft<00:03:59.540> and<00:04:00.530> I've<00:04:01.340> seen<00:04:01.549> somebody<00:04:02.329> superglue

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
shaft and I've seen somebody superglue

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.610 
shaft and I've seen somebody superglue
the<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:05.359> know<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.600> protective<00:04:06.079> plate<00:04:06.320> here

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
the you know the protective plate here

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.360 
the you know the protective plate here
that<00:04:06.829> covers<00:04:07.640> your<00:04:08.510> shaft<00:04:08.780> connector<00:04:09.370> they

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
that covers your shaft connector they

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.940 
that covers your shaft connector they
just<00:04:10.579> simply<00:04:10.730> glued<00:04:11.329> it<00:04:11.480> onto<00:04:11.930> here<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.650> I

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
just simply glued it onto here and I

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.319 
just simply glued it onto here and I
didn't<00:04:13.280> really<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.730> idea<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.150> it

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
didn't really like the idea of that it

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.750 
didn't really like the idea of that it
you<00:04:14.690> know<00:04:14.750> being<00:04:15.049> permanent<00:04:15.680> stuck<00:04:16.489> there<00:04:16.729> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
you know being permanent stuck there and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.740 
you know being permanent stuck there and
that<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.870> cover<00:04:18.200> really<00:04:18.530> isn't<00:04:19.840> absolutely

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
that this cover really isn't absolutely

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.320 
that this cover really isn't absolutely
you<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.460> straight<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.640> flat<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.210> there

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
you know straight and flat so there

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.000 
you know straight and flat so there
would<00:04:24.480> be<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.870> weak<00:04:25.170> point<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.740> would<00:04:25.800> just

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
would be a weak point and I would just

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.330 
would be a weak point and I would just
think<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:27.090> could<00:04:27.150> snap<00:04:27.990> off<00:04:28.260> fairly<00:04:28.890> easy<00:04:29.220> so

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
think it could snap off fairly easy so

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.560 
think it could snap off fairly easy so
to<00:04:29.730> solve<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.450> I've<00:04:31.200> used

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
to solve that I've used

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.230 
to solve that I've used
industrial-strength<00:04:33.570> dual<00:04:34.170> snap<00:04:34.620> or<00:04:34.950> dual

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
industrial-strength dual snap or dual

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.010 
industrial-strength dual snap or dual
what<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.330> they<00:04:36.420> call<00:04:36.690> it

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
what do they call it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
what do they call it
you<00:04:37.200> know<00:04:37.260> dual<00:04:37.500> lock<00:04:37.850> 3m<00:04:38.850> velcro<00:04:39.860> which<00:04:40.860> is

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
you know dual lock 3m velcro which is

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.540 
you know dual lock 3m velcro which is
really<00:04:41.790> heavy-duty<00:04:42.060> stuff<00:04:43.040> pretty<00:04:44.040> much<00:04:44.100> once

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
really heavy-duty stuff pretty much once

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.450 
really heavy-duty stuff pretty much once
you<00:04:44.670> snap<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.240> there<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:48.180> yeah<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:50.100> takes<00:04:50.310> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
you snap it in there it yeah it takes a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.000 
you snap it in there it yeah it takes a
lot<00:04:50.790> of<00:04:50.820> effort<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.270> come<00:04:51.420> out<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
lot of effort to come out and the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.750 
lot of effort to come out and the
adhesive<00:04:53.850> on<00:04:54.120> each<00:04:54.390> side<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:55.340> super<00:04:56.340> thick<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
adhesive on each side is super thick and

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.060 
adhesive on each side is super thick and
super<00:04:57.210> strong<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:57.750> that's<00:04:57.960> that's<00:04:58.590> not<00:04:58.860> coming

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
super strong so that's that's not coming

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
super strong so that's that's not coming
off<00:04:59.220> so<00:04:59.640> ya<00:05:03.980> can't<00:05:04.980> see<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.610> video<00:05:05.760> but

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
off so ya can't see it in this video but

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.550 
off so ya can't see it in this video but
I<00:05:06.510> mean<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.710> solid<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:10.020> only<00:05:10.200> thing<00:05:10.380> that's

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
I mean it's solid the only thing that's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.350 
I mean it's solid the only thing that's
gonna<00:05:10.680> give<00:05:10.919> way<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.520> know<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.760> snap<00:05:12.030> or

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
gonna give way is you know the snap or

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.400 
gonna give way is you know the snap or
the<00:05:12.930> yeah<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:13.350> cover<00:05:13.590> releasing<00:05:15.260> but<00:05:16.260> yeah

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
the yeah the cover releasing but yeah

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.440 
the yeah the cover releasing but yeah
really<00:05:16.919> impressed<00:05:17.310> with<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:17.760> setup<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.330> I

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
really impressed with this setup and I

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.280 
really impressed with this setup and I
like<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.380> smaller<00:05:20.510> wave<00:05:21.510> here<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.110> you

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
like the the smaller wave here that you

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.909 
like the the smaller wave here that you
know<00:05:22.410> really<00:05:22.820> fits<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:24.810> Babli<00:05:25.350> shape<00:05:25.620> there's

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
know really fits the Babli shape there's

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.490 
know really fits the Babli shape there's
no<00:05:26.100> extra<00:05:26.669> extra<00:05:27.600> room<00:05:27.840> or<00:05:27.990> anything<00:05:28.290> not<00:05:28.470> that

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
no extra extra room or anything not that

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.110 
no extra extra room or anything not that
that<00:05:28.830> really<00:05:29.100> matters<00:05:29.490> but<00:05:29.729> I<00:05:29.790> mean<00:05:30.030> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
that really matters but I mean the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.580 
that really matters but I mean the
bigger<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.540> case<00:05:30.750> obviously<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.260> more<00:05:31.500> the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
bigger the case obviously the more the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.270 
bigger the case obviously the more the
weight<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:34.530> know<00:05:34.620> want<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.950> lightest

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
weight and I you know want the lightest

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.050 
weight and I you know want the lightest
way<00:05:35.400> possible<00:05:35.970> oh<00:05:36.470> yeah<00:05:37.470> that's<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.890> Reika<00:05:38.100> ary

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
way possible oh yeah that's a Reika ary

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.890 
way possible oh yeah that's a Reika ary
see<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:39.750> wave<00:05:40.620> now<00:05:41.490> there<00:05:41.700> are<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.750> know<00:05:42.840> I

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
see a wave now there are you know I

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.600 
see a wave now there are you know I
think<00:05:42.990> up<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.380> five<00:05:43.620> different<00:05:43.860> versions<00:05:44.460> of

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
think up to five different versions of

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.700 
think up to five different versions of
the<00:05:44.700> wave<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.150> wave<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:46.020> wave<00:05:46.169> 3<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.620> way

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
the wave the wave to the wave 3 the way

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.300 
the wave the wave to the wave 3 the way
for<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:48.030> want<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.840> original<00:05:49.560> wave<00:05:49.800> and

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
for you want just the original wave and

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.790 
for you want just the original wave and
it<00:05:50.669> will<00:05:50.850> most<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.419> them<00:05:51.540> on<00:05:51.690> eBay<00:05:52.110> or<00:05:52.320> other
