I<00:02:18.090> recommend<00:02:18.690> bikini<00:02:19.230> bottoms<00:02:19.770> like<00:02:20.010> this

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
I recommend bikini bottoms like this

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
I recommend bikini bottoms like this
because<00:02:20.910> they<00:02:21.450> make<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:21.780> legs<00:02:22.020> appear

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
because they make your legs appear

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.050 
because they make your legs appear
longer<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:25.200> opposed<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> bikini<00:02:26.400> bottoms<00:02:26.940> that
