00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.650 
I think it's called early blight where
the<00:02:56.600> leaves<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:58.400> kind<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.790> gotten<00:02:59.000> brown

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
the leaves have kind of gotten brown

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.870 
the leaves have kind of gotten brown
spots<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.500> I've<00:03:00.709> been<00:03:00.890> picking<00:03:01.340> them<00:03:01.370> off<00:03:01.610> as

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
spots and I've been picking them off as

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.060 
spots and I've been picking them off as
they<00:03:02.060> die<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.690> think<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.230> has<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.410> do<00:03:03.739> with<00:03:03.769> all

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
they die I think it has to do with all

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.400 
they die I think it has to do with all
the<00:03:04.220> rain<00:03:04.459> we've<00:03:04.820> been<00:03:04.850> getting<00:03:05.330> but<00:03:06.260> they're

the rain we've been getting but they're

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.800 
the rain we've been getting but they're
still<00:03:06.650> doing<00:03:06.709> okay<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:09.160> I'm<00:03:10.160> not<00:03:10.400> too<00:03:11.090> upset

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
still doing okay so I'm not too upset

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.800 
still doing okay so I'm not too upset
and<00:03:13.110> I've<00:03:13.830> been<00:03:14.010> getting<00:03:14.340> my<00:03:14.490> first<00:03:14.850> read

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.059 
right bell peppers these are the
California<00:03:23.970> wonders<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.140> they've<00:03:25.890> been

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
California wonders and they've been

California wonders and they've been
doing<00:03:26.250> good<00:03:26.930> they've<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.530> far<00:03:28.830> they've<00:03:29.220> out

produced<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.940> China<00:03:32.940> Giants<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.550> might

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
produced the China Giants but that might

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.520 
produced the China Giants but that might
be<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:35.970> they're<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> front<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.410> they

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
be because they're in the front and they

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
be because they're in the front and they

tomato on there yet I did I've done an

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.509 
tomato on there yet I did I've done an
experiment<00:04:06.690> this<00:04:07.080> year<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.950> haven't

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
experiment this year and I haven't

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.240 
experiment this year and I haven't
picked<00:04:08.730> any<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> suckers<00:04:09.900> up<00:04:10.830> at<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
picked any of the suckers up at the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.610 
picked any of the suckers up at the
tomato<00:04:11.610> plants<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:14.600> for<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.690> Brandywine<00:04:16.290> it

tomato plants and for the Brandywine it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.460 
tomato plants and for the Brandywine it
hasn't<00:04:16.979> worked<00:04:17.160> because<00:04:17.579> it's<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.120> like<00:04:18.209> a

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
hasn't worked because it's just like a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.060 
hasn't worked because it's just like a
giant<00:04:19.470> jungle<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:21.440> branches<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.620> might<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.950> to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
giant jungle of branches I might have to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.060 
giant jungle of branches I might have to
pick<00:04:23.340> cut<00:04:23.820> some<00:04:24.090> out<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.540> if<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.500> hope<00:04:26.040> to

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
pick cut some out of there if I hope to

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.630 
pick cut some out of there if I hope to
get<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.520> tomato<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.950> Sun<00:04:29.130> Sugar's<00:04:29.490> have

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
get a tomato but the Sun Sugar's have

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.400 
get a tomato but the Sun Sugar's have
done<00:04:29.820> good<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:31.100> less<00:04:32.100> work<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.140> still

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
done good so less work and it still

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.090 
done good so less work and it still
yields<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:35.039> lot<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.470> here's<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:40.100> serrano
