00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.319
 hello the show welcome to my meetingpoint modes 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.420
 you do not need money for these meeting point modes 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.790
 the only thing you have to do is talk to the customer at room land 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:14.729
 I would show it where it is 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.710
 this is so it states 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.150
 would put this to the debate 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.159
 well wuytens was the upper room 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.449
 nice though and through 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.470
 and the clinic sat 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339
 then you see a fax 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.159
 the team was measured by picking 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.110
 at his fall in the tour you have 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 no time to jack up again and sold at some polls and get more 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.330
 some just one 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.930
 usually not anymore 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.840
 And then you just have to body banks 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.550
 and then later you just have to start spinning 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 that is also explained 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.440
 click for food 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 you sometimes have first aid 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 the gas burner 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.720
 that he just won't be 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 insane ones 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 but I have the tricks of 68 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.840
 Lusaka to see how you do 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.120

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.800
 nouwen spiders so we also do in kamelot that has stayed there in this house 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.950
 point the mat 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 that is here also the jumbo a lost the pier 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.810
 a cottage with muscular new 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.020

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.060
 I want that too 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.930
 Dalmatian broadcaster 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.200
 you can sell the position during rush hour for t lansink for two years I would 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 show first 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
 how because of the etherea 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 and quite fast 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 she displaces dsc 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 finally 80 km per hour 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.960
 sister just edition thousand place 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.810
 and that knows banks and then 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
 the spiders and sometimes I have way too many people here 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.689
 now i have we in the front factory 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.079
 anderson worth 5k 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.079
 and then who they later buy from the excesses will go bargain hunting 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.019
 a position in the bank 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.509
 the more of knowing and by doing 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.659
 and then you can earn something of 80 km with it 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.719
 this year but you never know I have learned judgment
