00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.870
 the nintendo nx project is the project 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.910
 under which the new console is known 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.039
 of nintendo even when it seems that the 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.929
 nintendo wii you have a long way to go 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.940
 touring nintendo could be 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.359
 preparing the nintendo nx for 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.890
 be officially presented next year 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.500
 the plans of the launch of the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.509
 nintendo nx are betrayed through the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.220
 business partners of the great company 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.560
 who will be in charge of their 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.290
 manufacturing the foxconn company 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.760
 Ona electronics and precision industry is 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.470
 who has the contract 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.110
 corresponding to the production in 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.940
 mass of the nintendo nx just gave 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 more details as your competition 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
 immediate megatone technology is 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.180
 trying to share the production of 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.820
 the new console thing that does not 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.980
 agrees a few months ago the new 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.370
 Nintendo had ratted on 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.290
 his plans to launch next year 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.630
 2016 was also the news that the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.510
 production of the nintendo nx would begin 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.520
 in the period March 2016 fact that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.010
 seems to materialize according to the supposed 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.300
 dates the nintendo nx has as 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 Launch pad 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.290
 The e3 2016 event where it would be excellent 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.450
 for two paramount things 1 do 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.020
 honor to the e3 main event of the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.210
 video game industry 2 redeem from 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.890
 its disastrous presentation and presence 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.310
 in e3 2015 let's be honest nintendo 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.470
 it was a resounding failure in the e3 2015 its 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.930
 digital event was extremely boring 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.880
 they presented a zelda that nobody wants a 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.890
 new metro and that everyone hates and when 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 it seems that the star was starfox 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 but the truth is that it's not the big deal 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.179
 Nintendo declares that neither the 3ds nor the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.729
 will you be overshadowed by the new 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.590
 nintendo nx but they will be an axis of 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.319
 entertainment the truth I do not understand 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.270
 this actually I do not even understand the 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.159
 made to launch a new console with the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.159
 wii you with just 3 years in the market 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.569
 what we want are more nintendo games 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.700
 does not understand that nintendo maniacs 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.819
 they want one more thing more games 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.500
 different different experiences 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.690
 Expanded in the personal thing bothers me 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.580
 be watching new mario tennis and more than 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.580
 the same without seeing a noticeable improvement 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.340
 the wiiu has not been fully exploited and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.010
 while playstation 4 and xbox one finally 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660
 presented new ip and more releases 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.480
 that will make our investment in a 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.700
 console nexgen worth the nintendo 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 he's still sitting in the corner apparently 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.560
 lamenting about the wiiu but good what 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.200
 do you think the launch of the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.150
 nintendo nx is a good strategy or 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.790
 an act desperate to recover what 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.709
 lost I invite you to leave in the box 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.709
 comments what do you think about this last 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 before finishing I want to clarify that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.040
 I'm a fanboy of no console and I'm not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.650
 in favor of any company failing 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.200
 on the contrary every time one of these 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.480
 companies fail there are many titles 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.599
 that they never get to see the light so 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.060
 I do not wish that to anyone well either. 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.000
 clarified this I say goodbye to 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.440
 everyone has spoken to them master cloud and the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.440
 I wait in my next video
