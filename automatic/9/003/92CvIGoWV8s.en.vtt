00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.360
 here ale ale is not a stadium choir 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.700
 soon it will become a new anthem for the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.740
 soccer lecco an hymn of the author because a 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.480
 the luf was the collective 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.310
 music led by dario canossi who 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.630
 can boast many fans in ours 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.190
 territory 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.260
 but if it comes from the Camonica valley 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.390
 but for years residing in Monticello and now 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.340
 lick music teacher she worked 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.499
 for several weeks on a project that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.550
 will soon become reality 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.739
 thanks also to the contribution of the team 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 bluceleste that is joined to the band for 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.949
 give voice to the choirs in Lecce dialect 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.359
 which will be a return to the union 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.670
 catchy but at the same time 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.710
 majestic with strophes an Italian who 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.449
 they resemble the lake the resegone yet 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.249
 betrothed 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.989
 the voice of davide chestnuts and companions 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.699
 is combined with bagpipe melodies 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.039
 violin accordion and others 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.870
 fox tools typical of luf for a 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.049
 well-made mix all to listen to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.590
 and above all to sing dario canossi 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.210
 leader pack leader of the luf creators of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 this new anthem of lecco football 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.830
 then dario first of all how it was born 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.540
 this idea but this idea was born 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 chatting with a character from 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.900
 lecco in a pub he told us but 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.190
 why don't you do this stuff here and us 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.080
 at the beginning we are left 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.550
 quite thrilled because mine 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.800
 proximity to football up to that point 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.230
 it was really very limited 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.170
 But from there the cause of every challenge 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.000
 important and I started listening to the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.650
 several years and try to figure out which one 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.010
 it could be the world that we are 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.990
 he was more interested and then from there 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.060
 a whole descent in the sense that we have 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.890
 started having fun where he does 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.440
 we started writing up to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.680
 to arrive at the final today a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.450
 this to the recordings here you are 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.370
 inspired by something someone in 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.320
 particular where the various ideas were born 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.030
 various cues for this song song 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.280
 it wanders more than a hymn is a real song 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 and it is not the usual canzonetta that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.070
 feels at some stage but 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.869
 definitely listening to the hymns there us 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.459
 we are told that they seemed a little to us 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.740
 sad ones we heard in 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.400
 general and various teams around 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.410
 for Italy 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.040
 but we have referred to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.439
 our 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.299
 so we have referred to the folk 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.790
 that's what our soul is 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.500
 from there to us we got to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.480
 write as if we were simply 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.150
 writing one of our songs 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.189
 thinking that in this case he would have 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.230
 had to be sung at the stadium e 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.260
 sung by all the fans of lecco 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.359
 from there we put our soul and we have 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.269
 tried to do one thing the most unanimous 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.769
 the most collective possible and the team 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.989
 today she is well behaved in the studio of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.540
 team registration was 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.200
 exceptional here if they play like Campania 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.519
 surely in series you arrive on the fly 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 where will this hymn arrive? 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.180
 are the projects as will be presented to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.329
 public, etc. 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.370
 Well now we are for the moment 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.069
 here and we did it from then on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.810
 we will do all the various steps from 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.760
 start doing it on the radio 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.560
 then probably will be the speech of the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.090
 televisions but the important thing is that 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 get to people people start to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.980
 sing it because this is a hymn born 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.019
 to be sung then this is the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.599
 what we care about most and will be the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.699
 people to carry it around 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.690
 thanks thanks to you for the occasion is 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:28.669
 obviously lecco to the david chestnut 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.900
 captain of the echo what he did 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.370
 today being in a studio of 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.840
 registration instead of in the field of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.790
 soccer training 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.019
 but the strange thing because from me 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.479
 I think also from other guys 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.480
 it had never happened to us and there are 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:44.120
 have a great time also because 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.410
 could teach this song can 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.240
 teach new kids that maybe 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 they do not even know ours 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.480
 dialect you enjoyed 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.730
 yes very beautiful the song is pretty 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 hopefully people like it too 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.010
 thanks davide thanks for complaining
