I<00:00:57.320> actually<00:00:57.890> learned<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.340> downhill<00:00:58.579> along

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
I actually learned to downhill along

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.389 
I actually learned to downhill along
these<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.750> well<00:01:00.530> over<00:01:00.800> 40

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
these so well over 40

these so well over 40
really<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.920> stability<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> trucks<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
really the stability of the trucks is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
really the stability of the trucks is
really<00:01:06.330> nice<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> feel<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.260> different<00:01:07.650> than

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
really nice I feel a lot different than

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.750 
really nice I feel a lot different than
in<00:01:07.890> Paris<00:01:08.220> Paris<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.210> been<00:01:09.360> what

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you're right

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.600 
you're right
all<00:01:14.399> that<00:01:14.579> stuff<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.689> Randalls

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
all that stuff but I think the Randalls

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
all that stuff but I think the Randalls
definitely<00:01:17.610> feel<00:01:18.020> pretty<00:01:19.020> big<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> happy

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
definitely feel pretty big a happy

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.730 
definitely feel pretty big a happy

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
in Paris Randall's fell right in with

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.380 
in Paris Randall's fell right in with
their<00:01:23.440> stability<00:01:23.619> but<00:01:24.580> their<00:01:25.000> ability<00:01:25.360> to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
their stability but their ability to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.230 
their stability but their ability to
carve<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.049> dive<00:01:26.619> into<00:01:26.950> slides<00:01:27.369> which<00:01:28.090> I

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
carve and dive into slides which I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
carve and dive into slides which I
really<00:01:28.479> enjoy<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:30.159> 50<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.750> definitely<00:01:31.750> like

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.889 
straight as an arrow which can't be said
about<00:02:03.709> a<00:02:03.860> lot<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.039> other<00:02:04.189> constructs

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
about a lot of other constructs

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.640 
about a lot of other constructs
especially<00:02:05.899> this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
especially this

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.630

everything<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.370> trucks

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
everything on these trucks

everything on these trucks
I<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.849> enjoy<00:02:14.849> them<00:02:15.090> for<00:02:15.690> learning<00:02:16.260> how<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I really enjoy them for learning how to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.280 
I really enjoy them for learning how to
do<00:02:16.799> things<00:02:17.010> faster<00:02:17.510> I've<00:02:18.510> tried<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.900> trucks

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
do things faster I've tried other trucks

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
do things faster I've tried other trucks
and<00:02:19.819> at<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.940> point<00:02:21.239> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.290> lose<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:23.090> peace

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and at a point kind of lose that peace

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.570 
and at a point kind of lose that peace
of<00:02:24.239> mind<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.170> stability<00:02:25.379> when<00:02:26.099> throwing

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
of mind with the stability when throwing

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
of mind with the stability when throwing
a<00:02:26.730> big<00:02:26.909> checker<00:02:29.629> you<00:02:30.629> really<00:02:30.870> feel

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
a big checker you really feel

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.920 
a big checker you really feel
consistently<00:02:31.739> stable<00:02:32.549> throughout<00:02:32.970> your
