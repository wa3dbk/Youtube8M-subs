00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
we'll see if it works so here's how we

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.010 
we'll see if it works so here's how we
do<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:41.100> read<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> directions<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
do it first thing read the directions it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.950 
do it first thing read the directions it
says<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.950> capful<00:00:44.280> per<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.360> cup<00:00:45.660> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
says one capful per one cup for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
says one capful per one cup for
herbaceous<00:00:46.530> plants<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:51.329> would<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.570> my

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
herbaceous plants that would be my

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.040 
herbaceous plants that would be my
annuals<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.350> let's<00:00:53.070> give<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.370> try<00:00:54.050> we'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
annuals here let's give it a try we'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.540 
annuals here let's give it a try we'll
pour<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.129> I've<00:00:56.370> already

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
pour a little bit in here I've already

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
pour a little bit in here I've already
got<00:00:56.789> most<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> mixed<00:00:57.870> together<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
got most of it mixed together and then I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
got most of it mixed together and then I
want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> give<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> stir<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:01.410> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
want to give it a stir because it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.520 
want to give it a stir because it's
sticky<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> reason<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sticky and I think the reason for that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
sticky and I think the reason for that
is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.280> stickiness<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.240> sticks<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
is the stickiness really sticks to the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
is the stickiness really sticks to the
soil<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> pour<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.580> helps

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
soil when you pour it in there and helps

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
soil when you pour it in there and helps
the<00:01:09.330> product<00:01:09.570> last<00:01:10.250> now<00:01:11.250> something<00:01:11.610> really

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the product last now something really

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.630 
the product last now something really
important<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.260> product<00:01:13.770> is
