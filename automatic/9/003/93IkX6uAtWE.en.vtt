00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
sometimes the glue don't buckle up so I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.349 
sometimes the glue don't buckle up so I
Pat<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.750> down<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.350> blow<00:01:02.160> dried<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Pat it down I blow dried it and I just

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.859 
Pat it down I blow dried it and I just
combed<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
combed it out as you can see you do it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.230 
combed it out as you can see you do it
this<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> still<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> park<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.460> just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this way you still to the park and just

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.600 
this way you still to the park and just
like<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.510> hair<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.869> coming<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.460> from<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like your hair just coming down from the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719 
like your hair just coming down from the
top<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.930> lurches<00:01:13.140> colors<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.310> top<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
top it lurches colors right on top of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.440 
top it lurches colors right on top of
the<00:01:14.970> track<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> thought<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.240> pretty

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the track so I thought that was pretty

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
the track so I thought that was pretty
quite<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> people<00:01:19.470> probably<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
quite a lot of people probably do that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.670 
quite a lot of people probably do that
but<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.790> still<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.930> Luther<00:01:22.140> part<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
but I still like my Luther part just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640 
but I still like my Luther part just
with<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.119> people<00:01:24.119> yeah<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.990> just

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
with the people yeah but this just

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.770 
with the people yeah but this just
likely<00:01:26.630> underneath<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.869> had<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> down

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
likely underneath this had it down

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.660 
likely underneath this had it down
holiday

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.929 

I<00:01:34.229> might<00:01:35.229> try<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.530> method<00:01:35.979> next<00:01:36.490> time<00:01:36.670> I'm

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
I might try that method next time I'm

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.550 
I might try that method next time I'm
not<00:01:37.150> sure<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:41.350> I've

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
not sure I don't know when I've

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.320 
not sure I don't know when I've
exhausted<00:01:41.860> an<00:01:42.159> early<00:01:42.460> night<00:01:42.670> brochure<00:01:43.210> and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
exhausted an early night brochure and

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.359 
exhausted an early night brochure and
right<00:01:43.570> there<00:01:43.810> then<00:01:44.080> keeps<00:01:44.350> pushing<00:01:44.710> out<00:01:44.830> to

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
right there then keeps pushing out to

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.730 
right there then keeps pushing out to
see<00:01:45.549> how<00:01:45.729> from<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.720> track<00:01:47.020> there's<00:01:47.320> nothing

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
see how from that track there's nothing

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.130 
see how from that track there's nothing
the<00:01:48.580> hair<00:01:48.759> is<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.119> right<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:49.509> top<00:01:49.750> I'm<00:01:50.020> going

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
the hair is the right on top I'm going

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.510 
the hair is the right on top I'm going
through<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.470> side<00:01:50.710> right<00:01:50.740> here<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.340> minute

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
through this side right here in a minute

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.219 
through this side right here in a minute
just<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.149> half<00:01:52.270> thick<00:01:52.479> mama<00:01:52.690> do<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.930> side

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
just and a half thick mama do the side

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.790

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
and fix that so

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.340 
and fix that so
hopefully<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:01.270> way<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.480> just<00:02:01.810> cannot<00:02:01.990> wait<00:02:02.050> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
hopefully this way I just cannot wait to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.780 
hopefully this way I just cannot wait to
do<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.770> don't<00:02:02.980> wanna<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.490> right<00:02:03.640> away

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
do this I don't wanna do it right away

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.090 
do this I don't wanna do it right away
because<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.420> waste<00:02:04.600> money<00:02:04.900> can<00:02:05.110> i<00:02:05.410> mean

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
because it's a waste money can i mean
