00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.080
 instead of cellphone this magazine 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.060
 Once you see a phone but 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.930
 see two there is a reason 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.640
 this is the galaxy s 4 mini this 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.800
 the same equality and I wanted to show 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.470
 neighbors 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.480
 the differences are quite clear from the beginning 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.970
 from the beginning samsung wanted to create 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.340
 as he had done with is always one 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.320
 weakened version of his phone 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.410
 top of the range to give the possibility to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.600
 all with a few euros less to enjoy 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.180
 however of the power of his 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.860
 smartphone 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.590
 we put in the role and if I look but not 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 let's leave near s4000 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 has a 4.3 inch display exceed 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.680
 this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.900
 like thumbs 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.980
 moved by android 4.2.2 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.510
 some damage a little 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.510
 memory does not there 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.840
 two of the four 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.520
 8 16 gigabytes then we will see what will be the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.409
 version brought to Italy with the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.939
 ability to add storage with 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.120
 micro sd cards 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.600
 the courses also enhanced the 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.440
 and after the person to see 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.160
 who on 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.920
 he read 413 he understood about the sequences that 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.310
 become 8 megapixels 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310
 brescia 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.320
 there's the camera 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 nine understands them 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 lite as indeed 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 good if i look 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.980
 all 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 missions 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.230
 if when 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.950
 completely s2 children 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.909
 24 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.909
 6 the head 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.400
 regular 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.830
 four realities 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.640
 the film we also think that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.760
 flag much more 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.060
 the fire 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.060
 this 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
 put on the usual 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.590
 as mentioned 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.900
 on the revenues 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.239
 you know something less 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.319
 then do everything 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.319
 there is no application 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 sel which was exclusive to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.940
 now look very good 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 now we have seen in b 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.120
 of course 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.120
 the various applications we have seen 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.090
 we do not know yet what will be the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.760
 the price of this phone 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.010
 no 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.140
 network 4 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.049
 the series like 9 can be done without 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.049
 we can predict when 9 o'clock 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.709
 4 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.030
 and even if it's a piece that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.270
 optical but probably certainly more 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.220
 light 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.220
 after very soon we wait for him in 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.110
 editorial board 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.110
 with the s4 mini
