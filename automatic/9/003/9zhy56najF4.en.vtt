cut<00:02:42.230> needs<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.920> respect<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.459> outline<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
cut needs to respect the outline of the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.960 
cut needs to respect the outline of the
curved<00:02:44.510> end<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.319> bone<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.459> straight<00:02:46.760> cut

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
curved end of the bone so straight cut

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.820 
curved end of the bone so straight cut
probably<00:02:47.480> won't<00:02:47.690> make<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.989> but<00:02:48.200> once<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.650> get

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
probably won't make it but once you get

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.710 
probably won't make it but once you get
your<00:02:49.040> curved<00:02:49.430> cut<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.450> straight

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
your curved cut going you straight

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:02.260 
your curved cut going you straight
through

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.780 

place<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.050> pot<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.560> Trotter<00:03:03.980> palm<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
place the pot the Trotter palm up and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.270 
place the pot the Trotter palm up and
cut<00:03:05.360> through<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.630> palm<00:03:05.990> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.410> line<00:03:07.070> that

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
cut through the palm on the line that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.980 
cut through the palm on the line that
runs<00:03:07.460> from<00:03:07.640> one<00:03:08.000> toe<00:03:08.240> join<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.720> other

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
runs from one toe join it to the other

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:23.160 
runs from one toe join it to the other
and<00:03:09.230> deeply<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.250> thoroughly<00:03:10.430> as<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.790> can

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.649 

now<00:03:24.170> comes<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.709> really<00:03:24.890> tricky<00:03:25.129> part<00:03:25.659> you

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
now comes the really tricky part you

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.610 
now comes the really tricky part you
find<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.620> first<00:03:28.930> toe<00:03:29.930> joint<00:03:30.200> where<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:30.440> cut

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
find that first toe joint where you cut

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.580 
find that first toe joint where you cut
it<00:03:30.739> take<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> half<00:03:32.030> an<00:03:32.209> inch<00:03:32.330> step<00:03:32.659> down<00:03:33.080> towards

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it take a half an inch step down towards

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.030 
it take a half an inch step down towards
down<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.640> leg<00:03:34.790> towards<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.239> toe<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.799> now

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
down the leg towards the toe and now

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.470 
down the leg towards the toe and now
you're<00:03:37.190> at<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.370> ball<00:03:37.549> joint<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.060> larger

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
you're at the ball joint of the larger

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.170 
you're at the ball joint of the larger
front<00:03:38.720> toes<00:03:39.129> you<00:03:40.129> make<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> cut<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.670> expose<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
front toes you make a cut to expose the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.839 
front toes you make a cut to expose the
curved<00:03:41.450> end<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.170> bone<00:03:42.549> trying<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.610> free

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
curved end of that bone trying to free

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.520 
curved end of that bone trying to free
up<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.180> large<00:03:44.480> bone<00:03:44.720> from<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.959> knuckle<00:03:45.349> so

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
up this large bone from the knuckle so

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.100 
up this large bone from the knuckle so
cut<00:03:45.920> as<00:03:46.069> deeply<00:03:46.400> as<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.180> can<00:03:47.390> into<00:03:47.720> all<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
cracks that you've made I'll take a few

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.449 
cracks that you've made I'll take a few
cuts<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.079> expose<00:03:51.440> all<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.920> empty<00:03:52.069> spaces

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
cuts to expose all of the empty spaces

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.940 
cuts to expose all of the empty spaces
in<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.819> joint<00:03:53.060> but<00:03:53.299> once<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.170> do<00:03:54.349> firmly

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
in the joint but once you do firmly

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.930 
in the joint but once you do firmly
grasp<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> Trotter

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
grasp the Trotter

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.640

and<00:03:56.030> twist<00:03:56.420> at<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.720> joint<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.379> loosen

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
and twist at the joint to loosen

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.039 
and twist at the joint to loosen
everything<00:03:57.859> up<00:03:58.099> there's<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.150> there's<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.599> tendon

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
everything up there's a there's a tendon

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.440 
everything up there's a there's a tendon
or<00:04:00.349> something<00:04:01.099> deep<00:04:01.819> down<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.239> middle

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
or something deep down in the middle

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.940 
or something deep down in the middle
that<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.629> need<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.959> cut<00:04:03.140> but<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.410> just<00:04:03.620> can't

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
that you need to cut but you just can't

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.729 
that you need to cut but you just can't
reach<00:04:04.160> with<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.760> knife<00:04:04.910> until<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.620> twist<00:04:06.620> it

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
reach with the knife until you twist it

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.369 
reach with the knife until you twist it
and<00:04:06.950> stretch<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.280> out<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:08.659> do<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.260> then

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
and stretch it out so do it and then

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.170 
and stretch it out so do it and then
simply<00:04:09.709> cut<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.010> last<00:04:10.190> thread<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:10.879> holds

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
simply cut that last thread that holds

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.509 
simply cut that last thread that holds
the<00:04:11.299> bone<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.079> bone<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:12.500> trotter<00:04:12.739> it's<00:04:13.370> not

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
the bone to the bone to trotter it's not

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.009 
the bone to the bone to trotter it's not
so<00:04:13.670> hard<00:04:13.849> after<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.359> probably<00:04:14.480> took<00:04:14.810> less

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
so hard after all it probably took less

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:24.909 
so hard after all it probably took less
than<00:04:15.049> five<00:04:15.319> minutes<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.859> do<00:04:21.160> perfect<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:24.380> think

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
than five minutes to do perfect I think

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.780 
than five minutes to do perfect I think
we're<00:04:25.099> done

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:57.559 

prepare<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> hot<00:04:33.330> chicken<00:04:34.330> in<00:04:34.800> disguise
