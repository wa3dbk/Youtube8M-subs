00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.540 
12 goals and seven assists I'm getting
close<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> becoming<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.590> key<00:00:10.769> player<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> think

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
close to becoming a key player I think

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.780 
close to becoming a key player I think
in<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> top<00:00:12.030> right<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:12.630> see<00:00:12.809> right<00:00:12.840> there

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
in the top right you can see right there

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.460 
in the top right you can see right there
so<00:00:14.790> our<00:00:15.179> team<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.509> still<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.809> really<00:00:15.929> good<00:00:16.109> farm

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
so our team is still in really good farm

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.300 
so our team is still in really good farm
we<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> game<00:00:17.400> against<00:00:17.789> Cardiff<00:00:19.310> basically

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
we have a game against Cardiff basically

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
we have a game against Cardiff basically
I've<00:00:20.880> realized<00:00:21.630> our<00:00:21.720> team<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> really

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I've realized our team is like a really

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
I've realized our team is like a really
big<00:00:22.800> counter<00:00:23.189> attacking<00:00:23.460> team<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:24.420> getting

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
big counter attacking team we're getting

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.970 
big counter attacking team we're getting
dominated<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> possession<00:00:25.619> most<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.920> these

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
dominated in possession most of these

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
dominated in possession most of these
games<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.670> still<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.269> winning

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
games but we're still you know winning

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.130 
games but we're still you know winning
like<00:00:27.840> three<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:30.359> figured<00:00:30.900> I'd<00:00:30.990> take

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
like three now and I figured I'd take

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
like three now and I figured I'd take
the<00:00:31.289> shot<00:00:31.529> right<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.769> ends<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.759> getting<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the shot right here ends up getting a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
the shot right here ends up getting a
lucky<00:00:33.660> bounce<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.710> players<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
lucky bounce to one of our players and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.930 
lucky bounce to one of our players and
Harris<00:00:36.030> ends<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.360> scoring<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> goal<00:00:37.940> we're

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
Harris ends up scoring the goal we're

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.569 
Harris ends up scoring the goal we're
still<00:00:39.180> played<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> talk

team I mean they really do have Premier
League<00:01:23.430> talent<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.299> why<00:01:24.509> we're

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
League talent I think that's why we're

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
League talent I think that's why we're
just<00:01:24.810> blowing<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.799> teams<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
just blowing out all these teams you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
just blowing out all these teams you
know<00:01:26.369> even<00:01:26.549> though<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> got<00:01:26.939> relegated<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
know even though we got relegated I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
know even though we got relegated I
think<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.500> fluke<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.729> know

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
it's weird it feels like we just played

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.910 
it's weird it feels like we just played
them<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> last<00:02:13.879> episode<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.629> think<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:14.959> did<00:02:15.170> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
them the last episode I think we did so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.770 
them the last episode I think we did so
things<00:02:16.790> are<00:02:16.909> getting<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> little<00:02:17.150> crowded<00:02:17.480> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
things are getting a little crowded I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.559 
things are getting a little crowded I
guess<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.519> nice<00:02:19.760> through<00:02:20.090> ball<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
guess I get this nice through ball and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.940 
guess I get this nice through ball and
I'm<00:02:21.019> thinking<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.439> going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.709> an<00:02:21.799> easy

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
I'm thinking this is going to be an easy

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.920 
I'm thinking this is going to be an easy
goal<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.610> they<00:02:22.760> goalkeeper<00:02:23.540> makes<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.780> nice

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
goal and they goalkeeper makes a nice

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.530 
goal and they goalkeeper makes a nice
save<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.579> was<00:02:25.579> pretty<00:02:25.760> sad<00:02:25.939> about<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.209> because

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
save I was pretty sad about that because

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.000 
save I was pretty sad about that because
I<00:02:26.659> wasn't<00:02:26.840> really<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.230> many<00:02:27.379> chances<00:02:27.709> this

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I wasn't really that many chances this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
I wasn't really that many chances this
game<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.400> game<00:02:28.489> was<00:02:28.819> probably<00:02:29.450> one<00:02:29.659> of<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
game this game was probably one of the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720 
game this game was probably one of the
slower<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.409> we've<00:02:30.530> had<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.609> in

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
the win here but I'm thinking this team

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.559 
the win here but I'm thinking this team
is<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.019> know<00:04:12.199> gonna<00:04:12.440> get<00:04:12.680> promoted<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.579> that

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
is you know gonna get promoted and that

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:15.909 
is you know gonna get promoted and that
was<00:04:14.659> a<00:04:14.690> really<00:04:14.840> stupid<00:04:14.959> play<00:04:15.379> by<00:04:15.530> me<00:04:15.680> because

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
was a really stupid play by me because

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.029 
was a really stupid play by me because
I'm<00:04:16.010> not<00:04:16.159> left-footed

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
I'm not left-footed

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.289 
I'm not left-footed
but<00:04:19.039> we're<00:04:19.459> probably<00:04:19.579> going<00:04:19.849> to<00:04:19.909> get<00:04:20.000> promoted

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
but we're probably going to get promoted

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.990 
but we're probably going to get promoted
we're<00:04:20.539> up<00:04:20.599> by<00:04:20.629> 10<00:04:20.959> points<00:04:21.139> in<00:04:21.319> the<00:04:21.409> league<00:04:22.000> so

looked like he was he's way too far from

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.279

his<00:05:18.680> goal<00:05:18.949> like<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.849> know<00:05:19.969> I<00:05:20.000> mean<00:05:20.210> was<00:05:21.199> a

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
his goal like you know I mean was a

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.420 
his goal like you know I mean was a
lucky<00:05:21.979> shot<00:05:22.129> by<00:05:22.520> me<00:05:22.729> obviously<00:05:23.060> but

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
lucky shot by me obviously but

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.499 
lucky shot by me obviously but
goalkeeper<00:05:25.430> kind<00:05:25.849> of<00:05:25.940> messed<00:05:26.089> up<00:05:26.270> in<00:05:26.389> my

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
goalkeeper kind of messed up in my

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.629 
goalkeeper kind of messed up in my
opinion<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.520> there<00:05:28.969> we<00:05:29.089> go<00:05:29.620> 11<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.279> 90th

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
opinion so there we go 11 and the 90th

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.219 
opinion so there we go 11 and the 90th
minute<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.210> obviously<00:05:32.569> nothing<00:05:32.900> happens

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
minute so obviously nothing happens

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.119 
minute so obviously nothing happens
after<00:05:33.469> that<00:05:33.589> we<00:05:33.860> ended<00:05:34.009> up<00:05:34.099> tying<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.529> hope

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
after that we ended up tying so I hope

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.649
