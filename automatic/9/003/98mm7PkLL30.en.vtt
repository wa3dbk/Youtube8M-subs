00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
go over here to the same fishing spot we

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.840 
go over here to the same fishing spot we
went<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.480> last<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.820> seem<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
went at first in the last one I seem to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.470 
went at first in the last one I seem to
have<00:00:20.939> fairly<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:21.660> luck<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:23.480> actually

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
have fairly good luck with that actually

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
have fairly good luck with that actually
I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.410> other<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.099> we'll<00:00:26.430> go

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
I think it is the other way but we'll go

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
I think it is the other way but we'll go
ahead<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.699> fish<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.119> anyway<00:00:27.500> because<00:00:28.500> I'm

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
ahead and fish here anyway because I'm

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.669 
ahead and fish here anyway because I'm
sure<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.609> good<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:31.170> impart<00:00:31.529> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.020 

big<00:01:45.520> enough<00:01:47.460> usually<00:01:48.460> about<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.850> halfway

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
big enough usually about the halfway

the fish I'm trying to catch I'll

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.690 
the fish I'm trying to catch I'll
generally<00:01:53.979> try<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.310> move<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:54.790> new<00:01:55.030> location

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.430 

just<00:02:00.700> because<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.180> fact<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.570> if<00:02:02.259> you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
just because of the fact that if you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
just because of the fact that if you
haven't<00:02:02.560> caught<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.890> by<00:02:02.979> half<00:02:03.130> way<00:02:03.280> through

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
haven't caught it by half way through

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.039 
haven't caught it by half way through
the<00:02:03.520> timer<00:02:03.729> chances<00:02:04.119> are<00:02:04.270> you're<00:02:04.840> not<00:02:04.990> going

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
the timer chances are you're not going

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.830 
the timer chances are you're not going
to<00:02:05.259> catch<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> rest<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.090> timer<00:02:07.299> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
to catch it for the rest of the timer so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.210 
to catch it for the rest of the timer so
you<00:02:07.869> might<00:02:08.080> as<00:02:08.140> well<00:02:08.200> move<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.739> try<00:02:08.830> somewhere

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
you might as well move and try somewhere

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760 
you might as well move and try somewhere
else<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.869> isn't<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> normal<00:02:11.530> spot<00:02:11.709> i

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
else this isn't the normal spot i

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.920 
else this isn't the normal spot i
usually<00:02:12.130> use<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.550> actually<00:02:12.880> behind<00:02:13.420> me<00:02:13.720> a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
usually use it's actually behind me a

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.610 
usually use it's actually behind me a
little<00:02:14.770> ways<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:17.080> i<00:02:17.110> said<00:02:17.200> if<00:02:17.410> i<00:02:17.470> don't

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
little ways so like i said if i don't

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.690 
little ways so like i said if i don't
get<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:17.950> i'll<00:02:18.069> go<00:02:18.220> ahead<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.370> move<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
get it here i'll go ahead and move to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000 
get it here i'll go ahead and move to
that<00:02:18.819> spot<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.470> snag<00:02:20.739> them<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that spot and see if we can snag them a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.880 
that spot and see if we can snag them a
snag<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.880> ok<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:23.080> isn't<00:02:23.319> this

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
snag one there ok so this isn't this

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.290 
snag one there ok so this isn't this
spot<00:02:24.160> isn't<00:02:24.340> working<00:02:24.730> too<00:02:24.850> well<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.180> we're

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
spot isn't working too well so we're

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100 
spot isn't working too well so we're
gonna<00:02:25.390> go<00:02:25.480> ahead<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.630> move<00:02:25.780> away<00:02:25.900> from<00:02:26.080> here

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
gonna go ahead and move away from here

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.559 
gonna go ahead and move away from here
making<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.319> turn<00:02:29.620> Rebecca<00:02:30.459> oh<00:02:30.880> there's

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
making you turn Rebecca oh there's

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.180 
making you turn Rebecca oh there's
another<00:02:31.720> buoy<00:02:32.080> location<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.040> could

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
another buoy location here you could

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.280 
another buoy location here you could
probably<00:02:33.340> try<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.850> one<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> said<00:02:34.930> always

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
probably try that one like I said always

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.539 
probably try that one like I said always
use<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.470> one<00:02:35.739> right<00:02:35.920> over<00:02:35.950> here<00:02:36.130> around<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
use the one right over here around the

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.360 
use the one right over here around the
corner<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:38.560> always<00:02:38.650> seems<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.130> work

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
corner and it always seems to work

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.870 
corner and it always seems to work
fairly<00:02:39.940> well<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.239> me<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:42.489> we're<00:02:42.670> gonna<00:02:42.760> go

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
fairly well for me so we're gonna go

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.729 
fairly well for me so we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.030> try<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.269> one<00:02:46.290> time<00:02:47.290> park<00:02:47.590> our

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
ahead and try that one time park our

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.310 
ahead and try that one time park our
boat<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.160> right<00:02:48.630> first<00:02:49.630> time<00:02:49.750> I'm<00:02:50.110> willing

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
boat just right first time I'm willing

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.729 
boat just right first time I'm willing
to<00:02:50.350> back<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:52.660> too<00:02:52.840> far<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.440> think

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
to back up a little too far but I think

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.590 
to back up a little too far but I think
we<00:02:53.829> should<00:02:53.980> be<00:02:54.070> all<00:02:54.160> right<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:57.160> we<00:02:57.250> go

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
we should be all right there we go

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:13.320 
we should be all right there we go
okay<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.710> too<00:03:00.120> small

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
we're going a little too far over the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.270 
we're going a little too far over the
buoy<00:03:15.610> um<00:03:16.770> see<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:17.800> we<00:03:17.980> can<00:03:18.130> get<00:03:18.250> him<00:03:18.370> anyway<00:03:18.730> oh

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
buoy um see if we can get him anyway oh

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.770 
buoy um see if we can get him anyway oh

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
this area you can actually cast further

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.130 
this area you can actually cast further
out<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.550> know<00:03:46.970> if<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.120> want<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.360> bite<00:03:47.750> him<00:03:47.900> for

out you know if you want to bite him for
longer<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.540> can<00:03:50.690> cast<00:03:50.900> further<00:03:51.200> out<00:03:51.560> by

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
longer you can cast further out by

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.960 
longer you can cast further out by
holding<00:03:53.020> okay<00:03:54.020> we<00:03:54.170> go<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.380> got<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.620> fish
