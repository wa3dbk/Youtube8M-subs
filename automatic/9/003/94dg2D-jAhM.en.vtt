00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the enhanced vision system and what it

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900 
the enhanced vision system and what it
allows<00:00:09.240> us<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.870> do<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.440> augment<00:00:10.920> reality<00:00:11.490> what

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
allows us to do is augment reality what

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.700 
allows us to do is augment reality what
I<00:00:11.940> mean<00:00:12.179> by<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.380> allows<00:00:13.679> us

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
I mean by that is that it allows us

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010 
I mean by that is that it allows us
using<00:00:14.519> transparent<00:00:15.150> display<00:00:15.450> technology

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you're a pilot the infrared sensor can

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.809 
you're a pilot the infrared sensor can
show<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.979> temperature<00:02:08.399> difference<00:02:08.759> between

show the temperature difference between

show the temperature difference between
the<00:02:09.239> runway<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.929> adjacent<00:02:10.679> grass<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:12.090> can

the runway and adjacent grass that can
be<00:02:12.420> displayed

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
be displayed

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.929 
be displayed
on<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.299> HUD<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> could<00:02:14.019> land<00:02:14.409> your<00:02:14.680> plane

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
on a HUD and you could land your plane

on a HUD and you could land your plane
basically<00:02:15.939> what<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.540> does<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.900> make<00:02:17.079> your<00:02:17.200> eyes

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
basically what it does is make your eyes
