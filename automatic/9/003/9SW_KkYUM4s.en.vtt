Goldfield once I think we must have
missed<00:00:47.499> it<00:00:47.620> by<00:00:47.739> about<00:00:47.769> 20-25<00:00:48.729> miles<00:00:49.210> went<00:00:49.569> past

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
it had to turn around and come back so

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.549 
it had to turn around and come back so
it's<00:00:53.829> been<00:00:54.069> an<00:00:54.159> extremely<00:00:55.120> long<00:00:55.300> day<00:00:55.559> and

we'll get up early and we all feel
terrible<00:01:16.980> and<00:01:17.980> we<00:01:18.160> probably<00:01:18.370> won't<00:01:18.520> get<00:01:18.730> a<00:01:18.790> lot

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000

terrible and we probably won't get a lot
of<00:01:19.180> anything<00:01:20.050> done<00:01:20.470> that's<00:01:20.680> really<00:01:20.830> very

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
of anything done that's really very

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.460 
of anything done that's really very
productive<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.330> culture<00:01:25.690> here<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.080> very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
productive so the culture here is very

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.530 
productive so the culture here is very
very<00:01:26.590> laid-back

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
very laid-back

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.770 
very laid-back
there's<00:01:28.900> no<00:01:29.050> rush<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.320> do<00:01:29.680> anything<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.630> you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
there's no rush to do anything when you

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.680 
there's no rush to do anything when you
stopped<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.530> get<00:01:33.100> gas

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
stopped to get gas

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780 
stopped to get gas
you<00:01:34.690> also<00:01:34.840> stopped<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:35.620> coffee<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.400> sit

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
you also stopped to have coffee and sit

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.820 
you also stopped to have coffee and sit
down<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.510> you<00:01:37.780> talked<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.320> an<00:01:38.470> hour<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.800> a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
down and you talked for an hour and a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.240 
down and you talked for an hour and a
half<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:41.290> just<00:01:41.440> doesn't<00:01:41.650> seem<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.980> be<00:01:42.100> a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
half and there just doesn't seem to be a

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.330 
half and there just doesn't seem to be a
rush<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.930> go<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:46.720> prospecting<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.560> think

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
rush to go and go prospecting I think

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
rush to go and go prospecting I think
some<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.820> may<00:01:49.090> be<00:01:49.120> due<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.990> fact<00:01:50.260> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
some of that may be due to the fact that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.980 
some of that may be due to the fact that
the<00:01:52.830> prospectors<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.480> pretty<00:01:55.870> much

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the prospectors here have pretty much

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.060 
the prospectors here have pretty much
ran<00:01:56.500> out<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:57.570> finding<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.990> easy<00:01:59.200> goal<00:01:59.710> the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
ran out of finding the easy goal the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.610 
ran out of finding the easy goal the
goal<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.780> anyone<00:02:01.780> could<00:02:01.990> find<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.470> any

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
goal that anyone could find with any

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.010 
goal that anyone could find with any
kind<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:03.070> detector<00:02:03.640> because<00:02:04.630> they<00:02:04.870> don't

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
kind of a detector because they don't

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.419 
kind of a detector because they don't
know<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.409> fine<00:02:05.680> points<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:07.390> mine<00:02:07.630> lab<00:02:07.900> or

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
know the fine points of the mine lab or

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.150 
know the fine points of the mine lab or
what<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.550> really<00:02:09.850> listen<00:02:10.240> for<00:02:11.040> they<00:02:12.040> don't

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
what to really listen for they don't

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.730 
what to really listen for they don't
realize<00:02:12.520> there's<00:02:12.760> still<00:02:13.450> more<00:02:13.630> gold<00:02:13.900> there

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
realize there's still more gold there

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.440 
realize there's still more gold there
I'm<00:02:14.890> sure<00:02:15.130> there's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> lot<00:02:15.640> more<00:02:15.910> gold<00:02:16.180> there

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I'm sure there's a lot more gold there

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.590 
I'm sure there's a lot more gold there
they're<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:18.000> they're<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.030> buying<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
they're just they're not buying it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.580 
they're just they're not buying it
because<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:19.960> don't<00:02:20.940> recognize<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.590> sounds

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
because they don't recognize the sounds

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.190 
because they don't recognize the sounds
of<00:02:23.680> gold<00:02:24.010> they<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.210> sound<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.960> know

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
of gold they know one sound they know

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.020 
of gold they know one sound they know
mm-hmm<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.220> they<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.240> when<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.750> goes<00:02:30.030> when

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
mm-hmm and they know when it goes when

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.270 
mm-hmm and they know when it goes when
it<00:02:31.150> hits<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.390> big<00:02:31.570> piece<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.560> they

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it hits a big piece and that's it they

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.890 
it hits a big piece and that's it they
don't<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.580> anything<00:02:34.030> about<00:02:34.180> listening<00:02:34.660> for

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
don't know anything about listening for

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.950

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
better training so as I said hopefully I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.210 
better training so as I said hopefully I
can<00:03:33.310> provide<00:03:33.790> them<00:03:34.000> form<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.950> going<00:03:36.190> to

can provide them form and I'm going to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.610 
can provide them form and I'm going to
need<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:36.730> look<00:03:36.940> at<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.690> lay<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.020> land<00:03:38.140> and

the<00:05:12.449> quartz<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:13.340> fine<00:05:15.320> it's<00:05:16.320> broke<00:05:16.710> down

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
the quartz is so fine it's broke down

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.860 
the quartz is so fine it's broke down
over<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.490> years<00:05:18.080> very<00:05:19.080> very<00:05:19.560> weathered<00:05:20.870> which

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
over the years very very weathered which

over the years very very weathered which
has<00:05:22.110> always<00:05:22.650> been<00:05:22.979> a<00:05:23.040> good<00:05:23.250> indication<00:05:24.620> from

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
has always been a good indication from

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.340 
has always been a good indication from
what<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.830> found<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.699> finer<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.240> call<00:05:27.479> this

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
what I found the finer the call this

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.219 
what I found the finer the call this
area<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:28.919> very<00:05:29.190> old<00:05:29.520> it's<00:05:30.090> not<00:05:30.620> undergone<00:05:31.620> any

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.180 
look at how it rounded and smooth
everything<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.360> so<00:05:43.260> it's<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.560> been<00:05:43.800> sitting

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
everything is so it's just been sitting

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.180 
everything is so it's just been sitting
here<00:05:44.220> has<00:05:44.669> been<00:05:45.000> weathering<00:05:45.570> away<00:05:46.190> from

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
here has been weathering away from

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.020 
here has been weathering away from
probably<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.120> sand<00:05:48.479> and<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.830> wind<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.940> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
probably the sand and the wind and the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.290 
probably the sand and the wind and the
weather<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:52.710> ground<00:05:53.070> here<00:05:53.430> is<00:05:53.669> so<00:05:53.970> beautiful

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
weather the ground here is so beautiful

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.770 
weather the ground here is so beautiful
you<00:05:55.050> couldn't<00:05:55.470> ask<00:05:55.590> for<00:05:55.740> anything<00:05:56.070> more

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
you couldn't ask for anything more

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.330 
you couldn't ask for anything more
unless<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:58.080> was<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.260> little<00:05:58.590> redder<00:05:58.889> I'd<00:05:59.160> like

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
unless it was a little redder I'd like

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.730 
unless it was a little redder I'd like
it<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.850> be<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.000> little<00:06:00.150> redder<00:06:00.449> but<00:06:00.720> we<00:06:01.440> doesn't

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
it to be a little redder but we doesn't

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.950 
it to be a little redder but we doesn't
make<00:06:01.860> any<00:06:02.039> difference<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.630> look<00:06:03.630> at<00:06:03.780> all<00:06:03.930> of

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
make any difference but look at all of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.020 
make any difference but look at all of
this<00:06:04.320> decomposed<00:06:05.160> granite<00:06:06.289> and<00:06:07.289> quartz<00:06:08.030> it's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
this decomposed granite and quartz it's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:18.770 
this decomposed granite and quartz it's
everywhere<00:06:10.760> this<00:06:11.760> is<00:06:11.970> just<00:06:12.979> there's<00:06:13.979> a<00:06:17.780> nice

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
everywhere this is just there's a nice

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.990 
everywhere this is just there's a nice
iron<00:06:19.110> stained<00:06:20.599> quartz<00:06:22.190> very<00:06:23.190> very<00:06:23.520> broken

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
iron stained quartz very very broken

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.390 
iron stained quartz very very broken
down<00:06:24.530> this<00:06:25.530> is<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:26.370> weathered<00:06:28.160> for<00:06:29.160> quite

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
down this is all the weathered for quite

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.230 
down this is all the weathered for quite
some<00:06:29.669> time<00:06:29.960> so<00:06:31.070> good<00:06:32.070> chance<00:06:32.430> that<00:06:32.729> this<00:06:33.000> was<00:06:33.210> a

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
some time so good chance that this was a

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.650 
some time so good chance that this was a
gold<00:06:33.780> bearing<00:06:34.080> reef<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:34.830> it's<00:06:35.039> broken<00:06:35.280> down

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.810 

there's<00:06:39.530> just<00:06:39.740> so<00:06:39.920> many<00:06:40.010> good<00:06:40.250> places<00:06:40.640> out

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
there's just so many good places out

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.690 
there's just so many good places out
here<00:06:40.850> I<00:06:41.270> imagine<00:06:42.230> you<00:06:42.770> could<00:06:42.890> actually<00:06:43.280> start

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
here I imagine you could actually start

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.760 
here I imagine you could actually start
swinging<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.180> detector<00:06:44.600> anyplace<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:45.290> be

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
swinging the detector anyplace and be

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:58.239 
swinging the detector anyplace and be
successful

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.249 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.309 

you
