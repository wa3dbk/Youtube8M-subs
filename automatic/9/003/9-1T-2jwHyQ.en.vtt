dudes<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.939> electric<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.540> were<00:01:36.630> fighting

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
dudes the electric do they were fighting

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
dudes the electric do they were fighting
he<00:01:37.470> looks<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.829> Heidi<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.520> sees<00:01:38.759> some

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
he looks at Heidi and he sees some

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.800 
he looks at Heidi and he sees some
groans<00:01:39.720> man<00:01:40.049> version<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.770> hygiene<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> I'm

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
groans man version of hygiene now I'm

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
groans man version of hygiene now I'm
guessing<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.500> Heidi's<00:01:43.920> father<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
guessing that was Heidi's father and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.260 
guessing that was Heidi's father and
he's<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.619> know

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
he's like you are and then you know

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.219 
he's like you are and then you know
destruction<00:01:48.270> stops<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.750> from<00:01:48.930> saying<00:01:49.079> what

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
destruction stops them from saying what

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
destruction stops them from saying what
it<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.409> maybe<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.369> Heidi's<00:01:50.729> father

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it is maybe that was Heidi's father

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
it is maybe that was Heidi's father
maybe<00:01:51.180> Heidi's<00:01:51.630> father<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> scientist<00:01:52.590> as

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
maybe Heidi's father was a scientist as

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.109 
maybe Heidi's father was a scientist as
well<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.670> hides<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> got<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
well and that's what hides you got a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
well and that's what hides you got a
Deans<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:55.100> maybe<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:56.850> we

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
Deans from maybe you know for all we

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
Deans from maybe you know for all we
know<00:01:57.119> thinking<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> box<00:01:58.290> maybe

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
know thinking out of the box maybe

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
know thinking out of the box maybe
Heidi's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> code<00:01:59.430> or<00:01:59.460> somebody<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
Heidi's a code or somebody that was you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.090 
Heidi's a code or somebody that was you
know<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> die<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.740> made<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> clone

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
know about to die and they made a clone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.050 
know about to die and they made a clone
of<00:02:02.130> themselves<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.000> just

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of themselves I don't know I'm just

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
of themselves I don't know I'm just
thinking<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> box<00:02:03.630> either<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.100> was

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
thinking out the box either way that was

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.280 
thinking out the box either way that was
epic<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.240> shot<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:07.049> wait<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
epic for shot and when I can't wait to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.270 
epic for shot and when I can't wait to
see<00:02:07.439> where<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.680> goes<00:02:07.890> because

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
see where that goes because

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.249 
see where that goes because

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
all three bases you know that the smart

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.830 
all three bases you know that the smart
and<00:02:33.040> cleverness<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.970> basically<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.480> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and cleverness of it is basically just a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.870 
and cleverness of it is basically just a
science<00:02:35.200> overall<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.070> combination<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.730> how

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
science overall the combination of how

science overall the combination of how
they<00:02:37.060> use<00:02:37.780> their<00:02:37.990> own<00:02:38.140> records<00:02:38.590> how<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
they use their own records how they the

they use their own records how they the
feet<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.310> guy<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:39.700> they<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:40.030> stood

feet of the guy because they they stood
no<00:02:40.390> chance<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.140> wasn't<00:02:41.380> just<00:02:41.500> like

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
no chance but but it wasn't just like

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
you know I got my Apple I'm a kick-ass

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.690 
you know I got my Apple I'm a kick-ass
you<00:02:44.020> know<00:02:44.140> they<00:02:44.290> actually<00:02:44.890> used<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
you know they actually used a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.030 
you know they actually used a
combination<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.810> something<00:02:47.230> smart<00:02:47.620> and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
combination and something smart and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.100

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
taking the bite out of the Apple that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
taking the bite out of the Apple that
bleeding<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.560> them<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.310> just<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.610> holy
