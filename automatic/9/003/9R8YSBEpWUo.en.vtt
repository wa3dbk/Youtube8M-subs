00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
group about 10 of us that just

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
group about 10 of us that just
completely<00:01:17.759> surrounded<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> thing<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.080> all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
completely surrounded the thing at all

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.539 
completely surrounded the thing at all
times<00:01:21.350> some<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> challenges<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.130> had<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
times some of the challenges we had to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.969 
times some of the challenges we had to
completely<00:01:23.970> cut<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> frame<00:01:24.720> apart<00:01:25.110> back<00:01:25.560> here

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
completely cut the frame apart back here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
completely cut the frame apart back here
close<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> rear<00:01:27.330> end<00:01:27.570> cut<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
close to the rear end cut it up here in

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
close to the rear end cut it up here in
the<00:01:28.590> front<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> completely<00:01:29.759> separate<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the front and completely separate the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
the front and completely separate the
two<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.900> had<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> make<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:31.500> custom<00:01:32.040> brackets

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
two we had to make our custom brackets

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
two we had to make our custom brackets
to<00:01:32.700> white<00:01:32.909> widen<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> frame<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.590> on

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to white widen the frame out and here on

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
to white widen the frame out and here on
the<00:01:34.770> bottom<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> front<00:01:36.420> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the bottom two and also in the front on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
the bottom two and also in the front on
both<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.590> could<00:01:37.770> step<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> frame

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
both so we could step out the frame

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.090 
both so we could step out the frame
wider<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> accept<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> actual

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
wider to get it to accept the actual

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.090 
wider to get it to accept the actual
street<00:01:41.400> bike<00:01:41.610> motor<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> front<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.649> we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
street bike motor up in the front we we

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
street bike motor up in the front we we
had<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> relocate<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.060> radiator<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
had to relocate the radiator from the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
had to relocate the radiator from the
actual<00:01:46.560> r6<00:01:47.270> we<00:01:48.270> decided<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.750> wanted<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> give

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
actual r6 we decided we wanted to give

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
actual r6 we decided we wanted to give
it<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> juice<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it a little bit of juice so we put the
