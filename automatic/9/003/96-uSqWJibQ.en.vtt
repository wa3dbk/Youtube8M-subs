00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.840
 hello friends today I finally bring you the 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.610
 video that I told you long ago sorry for 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.380
 upload it just now since my ipod had 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.330
 a problem with game center and that's why 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.250
 I could do the video I had to restart it 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.090
 and everything he had before he was erased 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.860
 nothing to be able to synchronize 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.480
 correctly without errors you have to 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.410
 look at my other video where I explain this 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.660
 image that I made below I leave the link 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.220
 I synchronize my big stacks game 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.640
 to my ipod that would be the same as doing it from 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.640
 android and ios 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.850
 to make them from them to android is the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.650
 same procedure only that in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.400
 steps you have to change places 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.400
 from bluestacks 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.780
 this is my main departure and as I already 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.580
 is linked can not be done anymore 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.830
 new is to say it is no longer necessary 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 then I will load the game I made in 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.840
 my videos to synchronize it with my 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.840
 iphone 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.840
 well this is my other account I'm going to 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.730
 synchronize my town hall is just 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.230
 Level 3 truth only created for 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.820
 be able to make the video and show how it 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.830
 since it is only possible to do it one 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.810
 time 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.340
 now we have to open clash of clans 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 on the ipod or device with them and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 play the tutorial yes or yes just after 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.290
 we can synchronize it I already played it 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.290
 to save time 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.490
 while loading clash of plants in diego 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.520
 let's prepare for the synchronization 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.290
 very careful in this step you have to have 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.450
 in mind that the game we want 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 link always we have to use the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
 old device option in my case the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.800
 of bru stacks if we use new 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.550
 device we will eliminate our departure 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.550
 by the ipad 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.769
 ok let's start with the synchronization in 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 the game that we want to link we are going to 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.920
 game settings and use the button 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.920
 link device 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.660
 Now click on old device then 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.459
 in I want to link another device and we 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.080
 will generate a code with two minutes of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.930
 time to copy it to the device 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.700
 that we want to link we go on the ipad 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.770
 also in configurations link 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 device but this time we click 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.780
 in new device and we copy the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.780
 generated code 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.840
 once copied we accept then in 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.760
 ok and ready we will see a message 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.470
 that was successfully linked and will show 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.220
 the name of the device with which 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.220
 made the link 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.510
 when we give value in the current game 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.579
 nothing will happen but when we do it in 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 which we link the game will restart 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.180
 and will load the game and then 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.980
 a message will appear saying that he lost 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.200
 the connection since another device is 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.760
 is linking to your village this happens 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.769
 because you can not play with both 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.140
 devices simultaneously only 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.670
 can with one either ios or android for 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.019
 solve that you just have to close 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.019
 clash of clans in one of the 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.060
 devices like they see the synchronization 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.680
 it was correct and without errors charge my 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.290
 game he had in blue stack without 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.120
 problems or drawbacks now they 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.950
 I will show what happens if we start again 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.950
 clash of clans on both devices 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.090
 it is not possible to play on two devices 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.100
 at the same time but only with the same account 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.930
 in another video I will show how to use several 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.930
 accounts on both Android and jost 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.349
 good friends this was all I hope them 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 have served see you in the next 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.949
 video and once again sorry for the 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.229
 delay of making this video is that it 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.789
 it complicated me a bit in the description of 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.620
 this video will leave you a link of a 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.569
 Google form that I made so that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.250
 it's easier to ask for help or if you have 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.650
 Any questions or suggestions to make 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.270
 Regards, give me a like and subscribe to
