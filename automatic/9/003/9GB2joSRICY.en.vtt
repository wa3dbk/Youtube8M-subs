serious<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
serious I don't think it's going to be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
serious I don't think it's going to be
his<00:00:49.200> last<00:00:49.350> fight<00:00:49.649> nobody<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.219> wants<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> go

out<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
out like that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
out like that
I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.710> wants<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
I think he wants to go out with more of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
I think he wants to go out with more of
a<00:00:53.940> bang<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.629> more<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> positive<00:00:55.890> outlook

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
a bang or or more of a positive outlook

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
a bang or or more of a positive outlook
I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.629> would

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I don't think that's a way that he would

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.110 
I don't think that's a way that he would
want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.789> surely<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
want to go out I think surely think on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
want to go out I think surely think on
the<00:01:00.210> people<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.660> him<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the people around him are going to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
the people around him are going to
definitely<00:01:01.320> talk<00:01:01.649> him<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:01.980> another<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
definitely talk him into another one and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
definitely talk him into another one and
we<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> idea<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> Lennox<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.530> rather

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
we get the idea that Lennox would rather

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
we get the idea that Lennox would rather
like<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.250> happen<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.180> rubbing

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
like that to happen is he now rubbing

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
like that to happen is he now rubbing
