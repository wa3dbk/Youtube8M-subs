90

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
90

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.339 
90
really<00:02:14.010> got<00:02:14.190> me<00:02:14.370> puzzled<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:15.120> he<00:02:15.959> goes<00:02:16.170> for

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
really got me puzzled here he goes for

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.470 
really got me puzzled here he goes for
an<00:02:16.470> attract<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.519> don't<00:02:17.819> see<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.150> dragged

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
an attract and you don't see it dragged

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
an attract and you don't see it dragged
very<00:02:18.750> often<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.319> his<00:02:19.470> nine<00:02:19.680> tails<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
very often on his nine tails so I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.460 
very often on his nine tails so I
decided<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.269> scale<00:02:21.510> him<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.780> little<00:02:22.110> bit<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
decided to scale him a little bit and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.619 
decided to scale him a little bit and
set<00:02:22.739> up<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> light<00:02:23.129> screen<00:02:23.550> because<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
set up the light screen because the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.059 
set up the light screen because the
light<00:02:24.750> screen<00:02:25.050> will<00:02:25.200> protect<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.620> against

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
light screen will protect me against

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
light screen will protect me against
practically<00:02:26.819> all<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.060> nine<00:02:27.540> tails<00:02:27.780> attacks

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
practically all of nine tails attacks

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.770 
practically all of nine tails attacks
and<00:02:28.319> now<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> decided<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> switch<00:02:30.000> into<00:02:30.239> my

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and now I decided to switch into my

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.770 
and now I decided to switch into my
regigigas<00:02:31.819> because<00:02:32.819> after<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> light<00:02:33.480> screen

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
regigigas because after a light screen

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.570 
regigigas because after a light screen
and<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.470> amount<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.920> hit<00:02:35.069> points<00:02:35.099> it's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and that amount of hit points it's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.780 
and that amount of hit points it's
easily<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.480> vol<00:02:36.750> 9<00:02:36.989> tails<00:02:37.250> he<00:02:38.250> sets<00:02:38.519> up<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
easily going to vol 9 tails he sets up a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.789 
easily going to vol 9 tails he sets up a
nasty<00:02:39.090> plot<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.720> realizes<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.319> he<00:02:40.560> can't

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
nasty plot but realizes that he can't

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.619 
nasty plot but realizes that he can't
stand<00:02:41.160> against<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:41.519> regigigas<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.269> switches

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
stand against my regigigas and switches

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.140 
stand against my regigigas and switches
out<00:02:42.780> into<00:02:43.049> centralist<00:02:43.650> nicely<00:02:44.489> predicting<00:02:45.000> my

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
out into centralist nicely predicting my

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.589 
out into centralist nicely predicting my
thunder<00:02:45.540> wave<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:46.069> now<00:02:47.069> I'm<00:02:47.670> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> go

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
thunder wave there now I'm going to go

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.440 
thunder wave there now I'm going to go
into<00:02:48.780> better<00:02:49.079> free<00:02:49.349> because<00:02:49.739> i<00:02:50.120> was<00:02:51.120> expecting

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.470 
the usual hunter you see which step with
substitute<00:06:57.930> and<00:06:58.140> destiny<00:06:58.500> bound<00:06:58.710> because

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
substitute and destiny bound because

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.700 
substitute and destiny bound because
hiding<00:07:00.480> behind<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.870> substitute<00:07:01.380> would<00:07:01.620> have

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
hiding behind the substitute would have

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.340 
hiding behind the substitute would have
really<00:07:01.980> damaged<00:07:02.370> my<00:07:02.550> team<00:07:03.350> second

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
really damaged my team second

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.170 
really damaged my team second
game-deciding<00:07:04.710> point<00:07:05.340> was<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.730> fact<00:07:05.940> that<00:07:06.090> i

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
game-deciding point was the fact that i

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.150 
game-deciding point was the fact that i
got<00:07:06.510> that<00:07:06.630> critical<00:07:07.050> hit<00:07:07.200> on<00:07:07.380> nine<00:07:07.620> tails<00:07:07.890> and

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
got that critical hit on nine tails and

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.910 
got that critical hit on nine tails and
yeah<00:07:08.940> if<00:07:09.180> 90s<00:07:09.720> would<00:07:09.930> have<00:07:10.050> lived<00:07:10.260> longer<00:07:10.650> in

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
yeah if 90s would have lived longer in

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.470 
yeah if 90s would have lived longer in
this<00:07:11.040> match<00:07:11.250> then<00:07:11.820> there<00:07:12.000> would<00:07:12.180> have<00:07:12.240> been<00:07:12.300> a

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
this match then there would have been a

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.360 
this match then there would have been a
slight<00:07:12.810> chance<00:07:13.080> that<00:07:13.260> it<00:07:13.500> would<00:07:14.250> have

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
slight chance that it would have

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.400 
slight chance that it would have
attracted<00:07:14.760> a<00:07:15.120> lot<00:07:15.270> of<00:07:15.300> more<00:07:15.630> of<00:07:15.660> my<00:07:15.870> pokemon

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
attracted a lot of more of my pokemon

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.190 
attracted a lot of more of my pokemon
since<00:07:16.980> a<00:07:17.070> lot<00:07:17.250> of<00:07:17.280> them<00:07:17.490> are<00:07:17.670> male<00:07:17.910> and<00:07:18.200> being

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
since a lot of them are male and being

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.750 
since a lot of them are male and being
immobilized<00:07:19.500> by<00:07:19.860> love<00:07:20.160> means<00:07:20.430> that<00:07:20.640> you

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
immobilized by love means that you

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.700 
immobilized by love means that you
aren't<00:07:21.030> able<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.270> attack<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:21.930> maybe<00:07:22.560> that

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
aren't able to attack and maybe that

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.530 
aren't able to attack and maybe that
ninth<00:07:23.100> else<00:07:23.310> would<00:07:23.490> have<00:07:23.610> done<00:07:23.640> a<00:07:23.790> lot<00:07:23.940> more<00:07:24.240> if

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
ninth else would have done a lot more if

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.230 
ninth else would have done a lot more if
it<00:07:25.200> got<00:07:25.530> that<00:07:25.760> immobilization<00:07:26.760> with<00:07:26.940> love

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
it got that immobilization with love
