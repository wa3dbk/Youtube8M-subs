00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
thoughts on it personally i wouldn't

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.830 
thoughts on it personally i wouldn't
care<00:01:00.899> anything<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.440> condition<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.840> just

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
care anything but condition one just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.429 
care anything but condition one just
like<00:01:03.960> anything<00:01:04.350> else<00:01:04.850> if<00:01:06.049> you're<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.229> ready

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
to carry in condition one i really think

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
to carry in condition one i really think
that<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.450> need<00:01:09.840> additional<00:01:10.409> training<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that you need additional training and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
that you need additional training and
you<00:01:11.490> should<00:01:11.670> spend<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.000> time<00:01:12.180> shooting<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you should spend more time shooting and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.219 
you should spend more time shooting and
practicing<00:01:13.729> your<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.909> skills<00:01:18.200> although<00:01:19.200> i

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
practicing your other skills although i

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
practicing your other skills although i
mean<00:01:19.740> i<00:01:19.770> understand<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> position<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.210> better

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
mean i understand the position it better

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
mean i understand the position it better
to<00:01:21.810> carry<00:01:22.020> something<00:01:22.290> than<00:01:22.500> carrying<00:01:22.770> nothing

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to carry something than carrying nothing

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.340 
to carry something than carrying nothing
at<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:23.340> i<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.810> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
at all i just think that you know if

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.719 
at all i just think that you know if
you're<00:01:25.470> carrying<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.250> secondary

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you're carrying it in a secondary

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
you're carrying it in a secondary
condition<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> rack<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
condition where you have to rack the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
condition where you have to rack the
slide<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> chamber<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.210> do

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
slide or but what in the chamber to do

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.120 
slide or but what in the chamber to do
it<00:01:30.780> i<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:32.340> real-life<00:01:32.549> situation<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
it i think in a real-life situation it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.609 
it i think in a real-life situation it's
you<00:01:35.130> may<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.460> lost<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.790> opportunity<00:01:36.619> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you may have lost your opportunity to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.789 
you may have lost your opportunity to
use<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:37.920> weapon<00:01:39.140> although<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.290> understand

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
carry it locked and loaded ready to go I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
carry it locked and loaded ready to go I
think<00:02:08.280> those<00:02:08.429> wasted<00:02:08.819> seconds<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.509> having<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
think those wasted seconds or having to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.869 
think those wasted seconds or having to
try<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> remember<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.160> do<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.700> real

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879

situation

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
situation
it<00:02:13.900> could<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.409> what<00:02:14.739> kills<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.099> instead<00:02:15.760> of
