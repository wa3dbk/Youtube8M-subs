 what is credit trust it is very 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.799
 important thing about which many people 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.960

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.019
 I immediately and not say the first training 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.910
 and we immediately begin to fill it 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 explained by easy examples these things they 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 used as in ordinary life in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.859
 communicating with people as working with dogs 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.140
 here everywhere that is, we take fun as 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.390
 We present a little money box , but what we 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 give the form of money if I find any 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 positive emotions communication 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 game solving difficult situations when 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 the dog does not know what to do and you have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.969
 decide something for her when you are right 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.879
 and teach on her account that is on your 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.590
 total score falling money money differently 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 from the world just for stroking 1 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 money for the game 3 denyuzhki but for the fact that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 solving a difficult situation or when 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 you dog something saved something 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 such a denmark has declined so far there 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 that there are 100 of them 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.699
 For example, this is the first and then it happens 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.859
 it creed trust you can that for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.949
 pick up happens such that you were like 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.480
 buildings and poorly trained dog all 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.960
 creed to trust was written - worth the money 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.869
 right away 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
 Then they took the world further and on shouting 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.380
 Levchenko for something or seemed to be 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.790
 someone that he didnâ€™t seem that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 they didn't obey you he just 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 played play you revealed said team 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 stones and punished immediately write off - 3 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.150
 stages in this way regulation of the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 there is because you invested it that you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.040
 took from this loan something is left 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 dogs this what remains is your 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.740
 relationship 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.200
 if you have any positive there 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.689
 the moment that is, there is a lot of communication played 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 learning if somewhere you have something gone wrong 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.210
 there will be nothing scary dogs this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.310
 will survive 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 Ali Kramer there was nothing and you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.330
 started her shout at her stiffness not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 work the dog will clamp will leave himself out 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.490
 cards you do not work for me on the USSR 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.369
 all confidence you went into strong minus 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.100
 all leave me alone in this way 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.540
 the dog is building a relationship with you therefore 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 look carefully at your 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.979
 relationship with the dog do you think 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.590
 Why is there more positive credit 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.810
 trust or negative for positive and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 dog work with you well continue 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 work 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.220
 that many people who work the dog 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.170
 in childhood they stop with them 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.810
 work begins to wonder that the dog 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.459
 no drying really happens like 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.769
 up to a certain age in VK 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.010
 money in the dog that is our money then 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.130
 there are moments of communication 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 which dog greatly appreciated then you 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.820
 stopped the dog work too dog 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.850
 obediently she didnâ€™t rake you 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.170
 not just walking very rarely playing and 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.209
 gradually over and over again for each 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.730
 the team is writing off a little money 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.350
 dog lose this ezio for dog loses 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.850
 interest and all obedience is crumbling in all 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.549
 just what to do in a row 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.680
 she is glad to talk to the dog to run 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.690
 mixture pay attention and not some 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.239
 Birds to people who are on a walk 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.370
 secret trust will stop meaning you 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.860
 take china stuff by the fact that you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.989
 command the dog and give it a positive 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.620
 communication game new teams 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.260
 cognition of many grateful dogs 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.459
 here is this good moment therefore 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.930
 look carefully now at your 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.790
 dog if it's a puppy 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 you must actively invest his credit 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 trust there are different moments of development in 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.989

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.420

 take a look or take a little 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.750
 maybe you do not invest there 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.860
 wear their contribution wear invest then 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.620
 what dogs prices 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.599

 work before you come out for a walk and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.640
 you are not there, that is how you walk 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.400
 on their own take play not 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.099

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.959

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.329
 prices hugs and kisses and dogs do 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.730
 Do dogs more valuable emotions and attention 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.889
 maybe you islands are quiet man and 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.449

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.120
 some restrictions on freedom
