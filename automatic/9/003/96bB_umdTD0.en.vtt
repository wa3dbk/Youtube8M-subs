00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
of the regular Xbox version did it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.760 
of the regular Xbox version did it
doesn't<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
doesn't have that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
doesn't have that
stuff<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:14.940> happy<00:02:15.210> about<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.390> but

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
stuff so not really happy about it but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.810 
stuff so not really happy about it but
whatever<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> four<00:02:17.370> players

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
whatever so one to four players

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.300 
whatever so one to four players
and<00:02:18.060> two<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.110> four<00:02:19.290> network<00:02:19.680> players<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.130> think

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and two to four network players I think

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.070 
and two to four network players I think
the<00:02:20.400> 104<00:02:20.790> players<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.940> own<00:02:23.940> doom<00:02:24.570> 1<00:02:24.900> &amp;

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the 104 players is just the own doom 1 &amp;

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.240 
the 104 players is just the own doom 1 &amp;
2<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.680> doom<00:02:25.890> 3<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> think<00:02:26.460> it's<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.030> like

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
2 and then doom 3 I think it's just like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.440 
2 and then doom 3 I think it's just like
deathmatch<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.640> stuff<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.300> so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
deathmatch and stuff like that so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.020 
deathmatch and stuff like that so
nothing<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:31.440> special<00:02:31.770> alright<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:32.760> let's<00:02:32.910> go

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
nothing too special alright so let's go

fairly<00:02:59.610> small<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.400> thing<00:03:02.580> I'm<00:03:02.670> happy

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
fairly small but one thing I'm happy

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.930 
fairly small but one thing I'm happy
about<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.420> has<00:03:03.980> back<00:03:04.980> art<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.520> think<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
about is it has back art so I think I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.670 
about is it has back art so I think I
might<00:03:06.120> flip<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.720> thing<00:03:06.780> around<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.470> just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
might flip this thing around and just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.090 
might flip this thing around and just
show<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:09.030> case<00:03:09.840> instead<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.710> regular

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
show that case instead of the regular

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.330 
show that case instead of the regular
case<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.990> that's<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.170> with<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> games<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:14.070> also

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
