00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.660
 Welcome to colleagues like 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.160
 I would have liked to have heard something short 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.629
 Introduce the seedlings and keep you short 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 explain what he needs to do that 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.250
 great idea even I get that yes me 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.610
 war, nothing else you need this once 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 no reader the cost converted 23 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.380
 euro in the piece I think 270 or so 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 I have them now from the all nature 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.460
 brought or he wanted me somewhere 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.480
 otherwise no blitzer her one the lid 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 can unscrew the flood 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.429
 can pass through holes in it is so is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.569
 your song guitar tuned and then needs 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:47.429
 you sprouted or 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:50.999
 Seedling roller was the plaster 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.059
 bean sprouts alpha I sprouted to 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:57.120
 like for example it now high 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 cost 270 or 2 50 to 3 euros would 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.549
 I say the pack if the matter 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 not no capable 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.390
 he is scraping it anyway it is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 either too heavily radioactively irradiated 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.850
 or you read it again and again 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 that from all the things from not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.469
 organic cultivation just not no 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.210
 are capable and so I personally but 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.840
 make sure that the things no 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 mistake so what are you doing there you take 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 maybe two three tablespoons 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.649
 maybe two tablespoons to start with 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.020
 a lot and throw in the glass and then 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.659
 just water comes to it unfortunately only so 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.299
 that are really nice in the water 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 then that is a day to soak 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.710
 and then when that day comes 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.869
 Drain off water 23 times 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.840
 nice rinse complete water 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.109
 drain and put down just one 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.429
 kitchen in the room that does not matter 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.820
 either so that the water run rum 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.549
 can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.520
 or or just like that, I always put it that way 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.640
 it works great too but in the morning 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.369
 and in the evening then feel and then you can 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.450
 her with a soft time included 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.110
 at the latest after three days the dinger 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
 already eat 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.700
 that's three days now when you do that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.860
 look at the size and that's two days 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.370
 So you see that is not growing yet 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.560
 so much 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.730
 it was the same amount each one 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.190
 Looks like this glass is almost tomorrow 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.630
 full and day after tomorrow place the lid 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.060
 because they grow like crazy and there 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.120
 because on the third day you can do it 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.460
 optimally eat extra protein for 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.280
 me for you too these are amino acids 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.370
 a quality can be gorgeous again 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.990
 you can make a tasty salad 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.570
 sprossen it is such a taste haase 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.570
 The Mongols taste the milk here 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.300
 super delicious there are also people 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.910
 Eating mustard seeds ever 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.060
 not my case have let's see you 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.570
 Almost everything can sprout and grow 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.210
 to let 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.450
 They look super cheap history 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.670
 still the same as a small tip for heavy 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.290
 times or for times of need if one 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.480
 lying down that keeps it handy 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.550
 Eternal on one only a sip of water 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.470
 every two days and then you stop 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.600
 here the stuff so the things I can 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.630
 really recommend it really a great 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.240
 fine thing for the price above all and 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.960
 then you are really sorry for food life 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.370
 Food at its best could be said 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.960
 then you can do salad 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 I also mixed it myself 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.230
 but would not recommend my friends 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.340
 max not easy at all 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.510
 blender with bananas 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.280
 that's just a matter of taste 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.130
 all salad or so it is really 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.360
 a nice treat if you want that 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.490
 has it I think I'm with it 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.050
 Soest but I'm really the one 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.720
 wrong contact person i had to mine 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.580
 happy girlfriend 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.069
 so all these things are super easy 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.800
 super low to pull super heavy 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.920
 and then you shoot socially and another 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.319
 third track three four glasses before 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.239
 and you can choose different varieties 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.130
 so to speak 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.190
 have every day and always have 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.070

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.020
