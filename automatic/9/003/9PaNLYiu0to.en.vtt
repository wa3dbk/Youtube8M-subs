00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.810 
you do I don't know whether you can see
that<00:01:20.350> normally<00:01:21.350> what<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.860> would<00:01:22.159> do<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.759> you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
would have some of the standing at the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.730 
would have some of the standing at the
end<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.729> bonnet<00:01:26.119> with<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> reflector<00:01:27.140> kind

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
end of the bonnet with a reflector kind

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.340 
end of the bonnet with a reflector kind
of<00:01:27.860> reflecting<00:01:28.580> light<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:30.200> know<00:01:30.320> I

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
of reflecting light in but you know I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.020 
of reflecting light in but you know I
don't<00:01:30.590> really<00:01:30.799> want<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.220> i<00:01:31.520> want<00:01:31.549> something

don't really want that i want something
a<00:01:32.060> bit<00:01:32.210> more<00:01:32.270> dramatic<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.500> i'm<00:01:33.860> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.220> set

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
a bit more dramatic so i'm going to set

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.830 
a bit more dramatic so i'm going to set
it<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.810> then<00:01:36.140> we'll<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:36.799> what<00:01:36.979> happens

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.569 

yeah<00:01:44.469> not<00:01:44.890> bad<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.549> we've<00:01:45.700> got<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.060> intensity

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
yeah not bad so we've got the intensity

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.039 
yeah not bad so we've got the intensity
so<00:01:48.579> there<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.759> go<00:01:48.909> that's<00:01:49.359> kind<00:01:49.719> of<00:01:49.750> quite

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
so there you go that's kind of quite

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.919 
so there you go that's kind of quite
nice<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:51.039> what<00:01:51.490> we've<00:01:51.670> got<00:01:51.909> now<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.750> light

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
nice now what we've got now is the light

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.999 
nice now what we've got now is the light
is<00:01:53.109> coming<00:01:53.350> through<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.799> windscreen<00:01:56.009> from

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
is coming through the windscreen from

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.149 
is coming through the windscreen from
the<00:01:57.219> mirror<00:01:57.460> directly<00:01:58.420> onto<00:01:58.750> my<00:01:59.140> face<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.039> it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
the mirror directly onto my face so it

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.249 
the mirror directly onto my face so it
doesn't<00:02:00.490> matter<00:02:00.640> whether<00:02:01.299> we've<00:02:01.569> got<00:02:01.810> direct

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
doesn't matter whether we've got direct

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.660 
doesn't matter whether we've got direct
sunlight<00:02:02.619> outside<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.929> on<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.860> wall<00:02:06.250> or

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
sunlight outside on the on the wall or

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.880 
sunlight outside on the on the wall or
in<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.909> background<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:08.170> going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.739> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
in the background that's going to be the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.300 
in the background that's going to be the
same<00:02:09.160> intensity<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.840> wherever<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.680> shoot<00:02:12.040> in

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
same intensity so wherever we shoot in

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.870 
same intensity so wherever we shoot in
the<00:02:12.340> background<00:02:13.090> where<00:02:14.080> now<00:02:14.799> it's<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.670> going

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the background where now it's not going

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:26.640 
the background where now it's not going
to<00:02:15.970> be<00:02:16.090> overexposed

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.020 

and<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:28.130> all<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.730> way<00:02:28.970> around

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
and as you can see all the way around

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360 
and as you can see all the way around
that's<00:02:29.480> quite<00:02:29.900> nice<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.830> that's<00:02:31.040> kind<00:02:31.310> of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that's quite nice and that's kind of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.370 
that's quite nice and that's kind of
about<00:02:31.700> playing<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> exposure<00:02:32.990> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
about playing with the exposure and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.850 
about playing with the exposure and
that's<00:02:33.830> quite<00:02:34.130> sort<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.610> Moody<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:36.710> know

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that's quite sort of Moody and you know

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.770 
that's quite sort of Moody and you know
you've<00:02:37.340> got<00:02:37.700> sort<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.570> have<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
you've got sort of you can have a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.590 
you've got sort of you can have a
separate<00:02:39.380> reflector<00:02:40.040> coming<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:41.000> but

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
separate reflector coming in here but

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.320 
separate reflector coming in here but
you<00:02:42.110> know<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.890> thing<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.490> with<00:02:43.790> when<00:02:44.150> you're

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
you know the thing is with when you're

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.380 
you know the thing is with when you're
working<00:02:44.540> with<00:02:44.930> mirrors<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.730> reflectors<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
working with mirrors and reflectors the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.540 
working with mirrors and reflectors the
most<00:02:47.630> important<00:02:48.380> thing<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:48.890> when<00:02:49.370> you're

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
most important thing is that when you're

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.390 
most important thing is that when you're
outside<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:51.080> don't<00:02:51.530> have<00:02:51.800> artificial

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
outside and you don't have artificial

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.110 
outside and you don't have artificial
lights<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.210> that<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.810> want<00:02:54.520> intensity<00:02:55.520> you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
lights is that you want intensity you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.850 
lights is that you want intensity you
want<00:02:56.390> light<00:02:57.760> control<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.180> intensity<00:03:00.170> now

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
want light control and intensity now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.440 
want light control and intensity now
with<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.220> mirror<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.760> don't<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.180> much

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
with a mirror you don't have much

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.200 
with a mirror you don't have much
control<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.710> you've<00:03:03.860> got<00:03:04.160> intensity<00:03:05.000> now

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
control but you've got intensity now

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.260 
control but you've got intensity now
we're<00:03:05.780> we're<00:03:06.350> leveraging<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:07.250> Sun<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.880> we've

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
we're we're leveraging the Sun and we've

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.780 
we're we're leveraging the Sun and we've
got<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.630> coming<00:03:09.050> on<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.170> workable<00:03:09.890> Angle<00:03:10.550> now

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
got it coming on a workable Angle now

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.660 
got it coming on a workable Angle now
it's<00:03:11.180> up<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.740> most<00:03:12.920> important<00:03:13.580> thing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's up that's the most important thing

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.230 
it's up that's the most important thing
it's<00:03:14.240> up<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.470> cameraman<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:16.610> to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
it's up to you is the cameraman now to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.420 
it's up to you is the cameraman now to
you<00:03:17.810> know<00:03:17.930> don't<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:18.320> at<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.530> into<00:03:18.860> who<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
you know don't look at this into who the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.760 
you know don't look at this into who the
lights<00:03:19.640> going<00:03:20.000> everywhere<00:03:20.600> that's<00:03:21.170> up<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.620> you

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
lights going everywhere that's up to you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.430 
lights going everywhere that's up to you
now<00:03:22.070> you've<00:03:22.310> got<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.670> intensity<00:03:23.450> that's<00:03:24.200> up

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
now you've got the intensity that's up

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.550 
now you've got the intensity that's up
to<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.160> sort<00:03:25.820> of<00:03:26.000> then<00:03:26.330> control<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.350> light

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
to you to sort of then control the light

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.640 
to you to sort of then control the light
by<00:03:27.950> favoring<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:28.970> edges<00:03:29.480> or<00:03:29.840> maybe<00:03:30.320> putting

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
by favoring the edges or maybe putting

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.670 
by favoring the edges or maybe putting
some<00:03:30.890> translucent<00:03:31.670> material<00:03:32.530> over<00:03:33.530> the

some translucent material over the
windscreen<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:36.190> some<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.520> 16<00:03:38.270> or<00:03:38.720> some<00:03:39.080> f1

windscreen like some to 16 or some f1

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.320 
windscreen like some to 16 or some f1
which<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.640> like<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:41.170> translucent<00:03:42.170> sheets<00:03:42.950> or

curtain draped across the window of the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.060 
curtain draped across the window of the
car<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:51.620> will<00:03:51.890> soften<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:53.090> lights

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
car that will soften the lights

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.740 
car that will soften the lights
tremendously<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.459> also<00:03:55.700> cut<00:03:56.240> a<00:03:56.270> lot<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
tremendously it also cut a lot of the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.960 
tremendously it also cut a lot of the
light<00:03:56.959> down<00:03:57.320> but<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.100> was<00:03:58.250> soften<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.820> light

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
light down but it was soften the light

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.630 
light down but it was soften the light
to<00:03:59.330> mend<00:03:59.540> ously<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.100> would<00:04:01.250> give<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.580> a

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
to mend ously and that would give you a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.270 
to mend ously and that would give you a
very<00:04:02.000> very<00:04:02.060> soft<00:04:02.660> bill<00:04:03.020> but<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.709> don't<00:04:03.980> see

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
very very soft bill but I don't see

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.750 
very very soft bill but I don't see
quite<00:04:04.520> like<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:05.740> I'm<00:04:06.740> going<00:04:07.130> by<00:04:07.370> what<00:04:07.610> I'm

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
quite like this I'm going by what I'm

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.540 
quite like this I'm going by what I'm
seeing<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.390> monitor<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.590> my<00:04:10.220> little

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
seeing on the monitor so my little

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.360 
seeing on the monitor so my little
monitor<00:04:10.760> isn't<00:04:11.600> great<00:04:12.230> that's<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.190> a

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
monitor isn't great that's going up a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.790 
monitor isn't great that's going up a
little<00:04:13.670> bit<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.720> might<00:04:14.959> be<00:04:14.990> fine<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.650> might

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
little bit that might be fine it might

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.500 
little bit that might be fine it might
be<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> little<00:04:16.130> bit<00:04:16.340> too<00:04:16.520> bright<00:04:16.820> looks<00:04:17.359> like

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
be a little bit too bright looks like

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.880 
be a little bit too bright looks like
it's<00:04:17.660> going<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.959> bit<00:04:18.169> bright<00:04:18.560> in<00:04:18.770> the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
it's going a bit bright in the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.610 
it's going a bit bright in the
background<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:19.820> my<00:04:20.330> face<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.660> going<00:04:21.290> up<00:04:21.410> with

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
background but my face is going up with

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.310 
background but my face is going up with
the<00:04:21.739> same<00:04:21.980> amount<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.760> brightness<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:24.050> that's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
the same amount of brightness so that's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.170 
the same amount of brightness so that's
kind<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> them

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.610 

you<00:04:28.720> know<00:04:28.900> that's<00:04:29.380> not<00:04:29.680> bad<00:04:29.979> i<00:04:30.009> like<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:31.620> but

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
you know that's not bad i like that but

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.890 
you know that's not bad i like that but
we'll<00:04:32.800> try<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.220> will<00:04:33.610> try<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.940> little<00:04:34.509> bit<00:04:34.780> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
we'll try it will try a little bit of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.399 
we'll try it will try a little bit of
fill<00:04:35.199> from<00:04:35.500> this<00:04:35.740> side<00:04:36.070> as<00:04:36.340> well

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.119 

okay<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:43.099> this<00:04:43.939> is<00:04:44.209> with<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:45.409> reflective<00:04:45.919> down

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
okay so this is with the reflective down

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.820 
okay so this is with the reflective down
here<00:04:46.459> that<00:04:46.999> reflector<00:04:47.689> is<00:04:47.929> not<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.589> best

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
here that reflector is not the best

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:56.070 
here that reflector is not the best
angle<00:04:49.219> it's<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:50.449> best<00:04:50.719> that<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.199> could<00:04:51.349> get<00:04:51.889> it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.870 

that's<00:04:56.710> without

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.659 

that's<00:05:01.570> in

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:14.810 

that's<00:05:07.669> without

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.930 

that's<00:05:15.510> who<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.500> think<00:05:17.100> it's<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:19.940> it's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
that's who I think it's that so it's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.610 
that's who I think it's that so it's
probably<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.330> bit<00:05:21.570> bright<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.440> need<00:05:22.590> to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
probably a bit bright that I need to

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.440 
probably a bit bright that I need to
take<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.100> exposure<00:05:23.520> down<00:05:23.880> but<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.120> don't<00:05:24.360> have

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
take the exposure down but I don't have

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:35.360 
take the exposure down but I don't have
an<00:05:24.570> arm<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.250> let<00:05:26.520> me<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:26.700> do<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:34.370> right

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
an arm so let me just do that right

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.330 
an arm so let me just do that right
that's<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.790> main<00:05:36.120> light<00:05:36.420> that's<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.740> must

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
that's the main light that's the I must

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.940 
that's the main light that's the I must
confess<00:05:38.580> The<00:05:39.330> Sun<00:05:39.660> has<00:05:39.870> just<00:05:40.020> gone<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.830> a

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
confess The Sun has just gone in a

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.560 
confess The Sun has just gone in a
little<00:05:41.370> bit<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.700> that's<00:05:41.790> probably<00:05:42.120> looking<00:05:42.480> a

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
little bit so that's probably looking a

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.590 
little bit so that's probably looking a
little<00:05:42.750> bit<00:05:42.990> done<00:05:43.320> but<00:05:44.280> if<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.970> wanted<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.330> take

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
little bit done but if I wanted to take

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.890 
little bit done but if I wanted to take
it<00:05:45.810> round<00:05:46.050> two<00:05:46.350> here

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.740 

they<00:05:53.500> go<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:54.160> bit<00:05:54.460> tighter<00:05:54.850> just<00:05:55.330> because<00:05:55.600> the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
they go a bit tighter just because the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.540 
they go a bit tighter just because the
nature<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.410> lens<00:05:56.650> and<00:05:58.139> so<00:05:59.139> that's<00:05:59.350> without

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.310 

and<00:06:03.550> that's<00:06:03.759> we're<00:06:04.090> just<00:06:04.509> offering<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:04.990> little

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
and that's we're just offering a little

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.469 
and that's we're just offering a little
bit<00:06:05.410> of<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.590> kick<00:06:05.860> light<00:06:06.190> on<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:07.060> side<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.330> my

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
bit of a kick light on the side of my

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.409 
bit of a kick light on the side of my
chin<00:06:08.020> there<00:06:08.320> which<00:06:08.889> just<00:06:09.220> kind<00:06:09.520> of<00:06:09.639> adds<00:06:09.940> to

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
chin there which just kind of adds to

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:20.190 
chin there which just kind of adds to
the<00:06:10.570> effect<00:06:10.690> you<00:06:14.460> can<00:06:15.460> see<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:15.910> there

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.680 

and<00:06:20.800> also<00:06:21.070> puts<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.700> little<00:06:21.940> bit<00:06:22.090> of<00:06:22.240> light<00:06:22.420> into

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
and also puts a little bit of light into

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.810 
and also puts a little bit of light into
my<00:06:22.960> eyes<00:06:23.140> as<00:06:23.530> well<00:06:23.710> which<00:06:24.010> is<00:06:24.040> important

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
my eyes as well which is important

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.800 
my eyes as well which is important
obviously<00:06:29.610> let's<00:06:30.610> take<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:30.970> exposure<00:06:31.390> down<00:06:31.780> a

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
obviously let's take the exposure down a

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.720 
obviously let's take the exposure down a
little<00:06:32.110> bit<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:32.500> I'm<00:06:32.710> actually<00:06:32.950> using<00:06:33.370> a

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
little bit and I'm actually using a

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.980 
little bit and I'm actually using a
manual<00:06:34.510> camera<00:06:35.730> manual<00:06:36.730> exposure<00:06:37.330> because

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
manual camera manual exposure because

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.990 
manual camera manual exposure because
you<00:06:38.260> need<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:38.560> be<00:06:38.800> able<00:06:39.040> to<00:06:39.220> do<00:06:39.340> that<00:06:39.550> right<00:06:39.790> the

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
you need to be able to do that right the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.950 
you need to be able to do that right the
sun's<00:06:40.270> come<00:06:40.600> back<00:06:40.870> out<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:41.380> where<00:06:41.560> it<00:06:41.800> was<00:06:42.960> for

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
sun's come back out to where it was for

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.340 
sun's come back out to where it was for
the<00:06:44.080> initial<00:06:44.380> shots<00:06:48.510> they<00:06:49.510> gave<00:06:49.870> us<00:06:50.050> a<00:06:50.200> little

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
the initial shots they gave us a little

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.920 
the initial shots they gave us a little
bit<00:06:50.590> on<00:06:50.770> the<00:06:50.950> chin<00:06:51.280> on<00:06:52.000> the<00:06:52.060> side<00:06:52.480> of<00:06:52.510> the<00:06:52.720> face

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
bit on the chin on the side of the face

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.200 
bit on the chin on the side of the face
which<00:06:53.680> is<00:06:53.710> quite<00:06:54.160> nice<00:06:54.460> with<00:06:54.910> kind<00:06:55.150> of

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
which is quite nice with kind of

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.640 
which is quite nice with kind of
dramatic<00:06:56.020> purposes<00:06:57.630> all<00:06:58.630> right<00:06:58.810> there<00:06:59.440> you<00:06:59.470> go

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
dramatic purposes all right there you go

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.540 
dramatic purposes all right there you go
there's<00:07:00.130> a<00:07:00.190> quick<00:07:00.550> way<00:07:00.580> in<00:07:01.180> which<00:07:01.420> you<00:07:01.450> can<00:07:02.550> you

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
there's a quick way in which you can you

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.850 
there's a quick way in which you can you
know<00:07:03.730> just<00:07:04.240> boot<00:07:04.720> some<00:07:05.110> light<00:07:05.380> into<00:07:05.770> a<00:07:06.010> car

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
know just boot some light into a car

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.310 
know just boot some light into a car
using<00:07:08.860> nothing<00:07:09.400> but<00:07:09.640> the<00:07:10.030> Sun<00:07:10.360> obviously<00:07:11.200> you

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
using nothing but the Sun obviously you

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.150 
using nothing but the Sun obviously you
have<00:07:11.530> to<00:07:11.740> wait<00:07:11.950> between<00:07:12.190> takes<00:07:12.790> and<00:07:13.030> stuff<00:07:14.160> for

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
have to wait between takes and stuff for

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.610 
have to wait between takes and stuff for
the<00:07:15.370> Sun<00:07:15.640> to<00:07:15.670> come<00:07:16.030> in<00:07:16.330> and<00:07:16.540> out<00:07:16.720> but<00:07:17.230> you<00:07:17.500> know

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
the Sun to come in and out but you know

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.590 
the Sun to come in and out but you know
it<00:07:17.890> gives<00:07:18.040> a<00:07:18.250> nice<00:07:18.430> effect<00:07:18.790> it's<00:07:19.360> quite<00:07:19.570> a

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
it gives a nice effect it's quite a

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.290 
it gives a nice effect it's quite a
dramatic<00:07:19.810> effect<00:07:20.580> put<00:07:21.580> some<00:07:21.760> of<00:07:21.880> this<00:07:21.970> shape

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
dramatic effect put some of this shape

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.040 
dramatic effect put some of this shape
on<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:22.630> face<00:07:23.580> and<00:07:24.580> it's<00:07:24.850> quite<00:07:25.510> good<00:07:25.870> because

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
on the face and it's quite good because

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.110 
on the face and it's quite good because
just<00:07:26.740> about<00:07:26.830> anything<00:07:27.310> else<00:07:27.640> you're<00:07:27.880> going<00:07:28.000> to

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
just about anything else you're going to

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.620 
just about anything else you're going to
be<00:07:28.240> bad<00:07:28.510> you're<00:07:28.930> going<00:07:29.140> to<00:07:29.230> be<00:07:29.820> battling<00:07:30.820> the

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
be bad you're going to be battling the

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.930 
be bad you're going to be battling the
bright<00:07:31.960> background<00:07:32.430> because<00:07:33.430> it<00:07:33.550> won't<00:07:33.730> be

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
bright background because it won't be

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.120 
bright background because it won't be
able<00:07:34.090> to<00:07:34.240> compete<00:07:34.720> with<00:07:35.080> what<00:07:35.620> the<00:07:35.830> Sun<00:07:36.100> is

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.130 
able to compete with what the Sun is

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.280 
able to compete with what the Sun is
doing<00:07:36.730> on<00:07:36.850> the<00:07:37.000> background<00:07:37.570> so<00:07:38.080> if<00:07:38.200> you're

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
doing on the background so if you're

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.460 
doing on the background so if you're
using<00:07:38.650> the<00:07:38.860> Sun<00:07:39.250> then<00:07:39.700> obviously<00:07:40.150> that<00:07:41.140> makes

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470 
using the Sun then obviously that makes

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.920
