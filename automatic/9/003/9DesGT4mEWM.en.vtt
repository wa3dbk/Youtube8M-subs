computer for storage
later<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.239> we'll<00:02:57.420> take<00:02:57.599> that<00:02:57.810> data<00:02:58.049> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
later on we'll take that data and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.690 
later on we'll take that data and
convert<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.299> from<00:03:00.299> images<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.469> pixels<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.459> to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
convert it from images to pixels and to

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.649 
convert it from images to pixels and to
points<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.170> inspected<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> what

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
points that can be inspected so what

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.449 
points that can be inspected so what
you're<00:03:06.810> seeing<00:03:07.019> now<00:03:07.109> is<00:03:07.560> more<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.040> more<00:03:08.219> of

you're seeing now is more and more of

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.420 
you're seeing now is more and more of

we<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.879> what's<00:03:49.180> called<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.599> point<00:03:50.319> cloud

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
we have what's called a point cloud

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460 
we have what's called a point cloud
image<00:03:51.099> and<00:03:51.370> as<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.599> see<00:03:52.659> we're<00:03:53.110> zooming

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.890 
image and as you can see we're zooming
in<00:03:53.650> we<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.209> hundreds<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.329> thousands<00:03:55.810> of

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.190 

and<00:04:10.519> each<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:10.939> of<00:04:10.969> those<00:04:11.120> points<00:04:11.390> represents

data from the actual park

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.900 
data from the actual park
we<00:04:16.780> then<00:04:16.989> take<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.289> point<00:04:17.739> cloud<00:04:18.009> into<00:04:18.879> a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
we then take that point cloud into a

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.290 
we then take that point cloud into a
third-party<00:04:19.769> software<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.280> merge<00:04:21.759> it<00:04:21.970> with

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
third-party software and merge it with

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.230 
third-party software and merge it with
the<00:04:22.509> solid<00:04:22.990> model

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the solid model

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.770 
the solid model
all<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:25.139> points<00:04:25.590> are<00:04:26.240> positioned<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.630> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
all the points are positioned to the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.420 
all the points are positioned to the
pallid<00:04:28.349> model

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
pallid model

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.620 
pallid model
we<00:04:30.910> then<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.840> do<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.139> comparison<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.970> point

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
we then can do a comparison of the point

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:53.310 
we then can do a comparison of the point
cloud<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.949> solid<00:04:36.880> model<00:04:51.509> we<00:04:52.509> also<00:04:52.660> have<00:04:53.050> a

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
cloud to the solid model we also have a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.460 
cloud to the solid model we also have a
spec<00:04:53.710> check<00:04:54.009> report<00:04:54.520> capability<00:04:55.210> where<00:04:56.199> we

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
spec check report capability where we

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.529 
spec check report capability where we
can<00:04:57.660> section<00:04:58.660> through<00:04:58.960> parts<00:04:59.440> and<00:05:00.539> inspect

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
can section through parts and inspect

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.140 
can section through parts and inspect
those<00:05:01.840> parts<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:03.220> nice<00:05:03.430> thing<00:05:03.729> about<00:05:03.760> having

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
those parts the nice thing about having

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.700 
those parts the nice thing about having
the<00:05:04.840> capability<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:06.360> using<00:05:07.360> our<00:05:07.479> CSS<00:05:08.260> machine

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
the capability of using our CSS machine

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.460 
the capability of using our CSS machine
is<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.370> we<00:05:09.610> get<00:05:09.789> very<00:05:10.030> very<00:05:10.210> sharp<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.960> crisp

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
is that we get very very sharp and crisp

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.300 
is that we get very very sharp and crisp
lines<00:05:12.270> very<00:05:13.270> much<00:05:13.600> unlike<00:05:14.139> having<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:15.070> saw

our parts being suspended in epoxy gives

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.430 
our parts being suspended in epoxy gives
us<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:26.949> very<00:05:27.160> very<00:05:27.340> clean<00:05:27.760> edge<00:05:28.410> no<00:05:29.410> matter
