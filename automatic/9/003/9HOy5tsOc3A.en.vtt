stopwatch<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.270> we<00:00:32.599> ran<00:00:32.750> both<00:00:33.050> systems

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
stopwatch and we ran both systems

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.830 
stopwatch and we ran both systems
through<00:00:33.800> not<00:00:34.340> terribly<00:00:34.760> scientific<00:00:35.420> but<00:00:35.600> you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
through not terribly scientific but you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.540 
through not terribly scientific but you
know<00:00:35.900> real-world<00:00:36.380> situations<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.190> see<00:00:37.370> who

know real-world situations to see who

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.520 
know real-world situations to see who
would<00:00:37.640> respond<00:00:38.030> faster<00:00:38.450> first<00:00:38.960> one<00:00:39.200> very

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
would respond faster first one very

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.710 
would respond faster first one very
important<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.010> boot<00:00:40.340> up<00:00:40.520> test<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.210> return<00:00:41.510> both

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
important a boot up test so return both

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720 
important a boot up test so return both
systems<00:00:42.140> on<00:00:42.290> at<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.530> same<00:00:42.740> time<00:00:42.950> two<00:00:43.370> fingers

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
two different stop watches as you can

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.010 
two different stop watches as you can
see<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.220> ipad<00:00:46.489> finished<00:00:47.239> its<00:00:47.390> boot<00:00:47.540> up<00:00:47.660> cycle

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
see the ipad finished its boot up cycle

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.420 
see the ipad finished its boot up cycle
first<00:00:48.200> followed<00:00:48.739> by<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.920> netbook<00:00:49.250> took

first followed by the netbook took

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.490 
first followed by the netbook took
almost<00:00:49.579> twice<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:49.970> long<00:00:50.300> now<00:00:50.960> obviously<00:00:51.320> for

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
almost twice as long now obviously for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.080 
almost twice as long now obviously for
this<00:00:51.620> test<00:00:51.800> we've<00:00:52.010> speed<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.730> up<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.000> you

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
this test we've speed of this up so you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.090 
this test we've speed of this up so you
can<00:00:53.210> see<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.720> kind<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.050> fast<00:00:54.260> motion<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
can see this in kind of fast motion but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.760 
can see this in kind of fast motion but
the<00:00:55.310> iPad<00:00:55.820> took<00:00:56.000> 20<00:00:56.390> 3.1<00:00:57.020> seconds<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.500> boot<00:00:57.620> up

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
the iPad took 20 3.1 seconds to boot up

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.310 
the iPad took 20 3.1 seconds to boot up
while<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.340> netbook<00:00:58.730> took<00:00:59.090> 50<00:00:59.690> point<00:01:00.079> five

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320

seconds<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.800> boot<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:00.980> that's<00:01:01.160> almost<00:01:01.610> twice

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
seconds to boot up that's almost twice

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.629 
seconds to boot up that's almost twice
as<00:01:01.970> long<00:01:02.420> now<00:01:03.110> our<00:01:03.260> next<00:01:03.290> test<00:01:03.860> we<00:01:04.129> decided<00:01:04.549> to

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:04.639 
as long now our next test we decided to

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.069 
as long now our next test we decided to
load<00:01:04.789> up<00:01:04.909> our<00:01:04.999> favorite<00:01:05.359> website<00:01:05.659> cnet.com

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.499 
load up our favorite website cnet.com
and<00:01:06.710> see<00:01:07.130> how<00:01:07.280> long<00:01:07.460> would<00:01:07.609> take<00:01:07.819> Safari<00:01:08.270> on

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
and see how long would take Safari on

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.899 
and see how long would take Safari on
both<00:01:08.869> systems<00:01:09.109> to<00:01:09.530> render<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.859> page<00:01:10.100> now<00:01:10.700> for

both systems to render that page now for
our<00:01:10.939> next<00:01:11.119> test<00:01:11.389> we<00:01:11.539> obviously<00:01:11.659> didn't<00:01:12.079> need

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
our next test we obviously didn't need

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.569 
our next test we obviously didn't need
to<00:01:12.259> speed<00:01:12.469> this<00:01:12.499> footage<00:01:12.920> appen<00:01:13.219> only<00:01:13.460> took

to speed this footage appen only took

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.599 
to speed this footage appen only took
5.4<00:01:14.479> seconds<00:01:14.840> for<00:01:15.020> both<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.560> our<00:01:15.649> browsers<00:01:16.159> to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
mobile for the iPad so they're not

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.069

quick on both of these machines now our
next<00:01:28.850> test<00:01:29.329> is<00:01:29.479> probably<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.929> little<00:01:30.259> more

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
next test is probably a little more

next test is probably a little more
technical<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:31.159> took<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.549> SunSpider

technical we took the SunSpider
JavaScript<00:01:33.079> test<00:01:33.319> that's<00:01:33.499> a<00:01:33.560> benchmark<00:01:34.069> that

JavaScript test that's a benchmark that
will<00:01:34.939> run<00:01:35.179> your<00:01:35.420> computer<00:01:36.170> through<00:01:36.319> a<00:01:36.409> bunch

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
will run your computer through a bunch

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.230 
will run your computer through a bunch
of<00:01:36.770> different<00:01:37.009> JavaScript<00:01:37.189> tests<00:01:37.789> repeated<00:01:38.149> a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
of different JavaScript tests repeated a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.999 
of different JavaScript tests repeated a
couple<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.539> times<00:01:38.659> then<00:01:38.990> give<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.319> a<00:01:39.350> time<00:01:39.829> in

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
couple of times then give you a time in

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.819 
couple of times then give you a time in
milliseconds<00:01:40.249> on<00:01:40.819> how<00:01:41.270> fast<00:01:41.509> it<00:01:41.749> ran<00:01:41.959> that's<00:01:42.740> a

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
milliseconds on how fast it ran that's a

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.620 
milliseconds on how fast it ran that's a
great<00:01:42.950> kind<00:01:43.249> of<00:01:43.340> cross-platform<00:01:43.849> test<00:01:44.389> we<00:01:44.509> can

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
great kind of cross-platform test we can

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.959 
great kind of cross-platform test we can
run<00:01:44.810> both<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.259> Safari<00:01:45.619> mobile<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.609> iPad

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
run both in Safari mobile on the iPad

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.120 
run both in Safari mobile on the iPad
and<00:01:47.299> in<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.599> Safari<00:01:47.990> browser<00:01:48.259> on<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.920> netbook

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and in the Safari browser on the netbook

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.190 
and in the Safari browser on the netbook
so<00:01:49.969> again<00:01:50.179> we<00:01:50.270> had<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.450> speed<00:01:50.630> up<00:01:50.749> this<00:01:50.869> test

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
so again we had the speed up this test

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.539 
so again we had the speed up this test
just<00:01:51.349> to<00:01:51.439> show<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:52.369> shows

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
just to show it to you but this shows

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.129 
just to show it to you but this shows
you<00:01:52.700> where<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:52.909> more<00:01:53.090> powerful<00:01:53.389> hardware<00:01:53.990> for

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
you where the more powerful hardware for

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.080 
you where the more powerful hardware for
the<00:01:54.200> netbook<00:01:54.380> comes<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.459> completed<00:01:55.999> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
the netbook comes in that completed the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.029 
the netbook comes in that completed the
test<00:01:56.329> in<00:01:56.509> two<00:01:56.990> thousand<00:01:57.529> two<00:01:57.679> hundred<00:01:57.709> and

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
seventy two milliseconds while the iPad

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.109 
seventy two milliseconds while the iPad
took<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:00.319> heck<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.709> lot<00:02:00.740> longer<00:02:01.119> twelve

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
took a heck of a lot longer twelve

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.669

milliseconds to run through the same

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.539 
milliseconds to run through the same
test<00:02:05.659> now<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.319> lot<00:02:06.529> of<00:02:06.560> people<00:02:06.740> may<00:02:06.950> say<00:02:07.159> this<00:02:07.399> is

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
test now a lot of people may say this is

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.669 
test now a lot of people may say this is
like<00:02:07.669> comparing<00:02:07.969> apples<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.599> oranges<00:02:08.689> maybe

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
like comparing apples to oranges maybe

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.749 
like comparing apples to oranges maybe
some<00:02:09.920> people<00:02:10.009> would<00:02:10.189> say<00:02:10.250> it's<00:02:10.459> more<00:02:10.519> like

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
some people would say it's more like

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.490 
some people would say it's more like
oranges<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.269> tangerines<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.230> kind<00:02:12.439> of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
oranges to tangerines the kind of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.809 
oranges to tangerines the kind of
different<00:02:12.890> flavors<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.640> same

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
different flavors of the same

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.429 
different flavors of the same
general<00:02:14.180> sort<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.390> computing<00:02:14.810> device<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.319> as

general sort of computing device and as

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.920 
general sort of computing device and as
you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.650> see<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.950> some<00:02:16.459> tasks<00:02:16.879> like<00:02:17.390> boot<00:02:17.749> up

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
you can see in some tasks like boot up

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.899 
you can see in some tasks like boot up
the<00:02:18.200> ipad<00:02:18.799> is<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> lot<00:02:19.069> faster<00:02:19.489> because<00:02:19.639> it's

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
the ipad is a lot faster because it's

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.550 
the ipad is a lot faster because it's
really<00:02:19.999> optimized<00:02:20.569> for<00:02:20.689> its<00:02:20.870> Hardware<00:02:21.200> when

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
really optimized for its Hardware when

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.869 
really optimized for its Hardware when
you<00:02:21.650> take<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.829> more<00:02:22.040> general<00:02:22.400> interest<00:02:22.760> test

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
you take a more general interest test

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.270 
you take a more general interest test
like<00:02:23.090> our<00:02:23.239> javascript<00:02:23.870> test<00:02:24.109> that<00:02:25.040> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
like our javascript test that really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.830 
like our javascript test that really
relies<00:02:25.549> on<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:25.879> computer<00:02:26.180> hardware<00:02:26.480> more

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
relies on the computer hardware more

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.509 
relies on the computer hardware more
well<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:27.349> obviously<00:02:27.499> our<00:02:27.799> netbook<00:02:28.189> even

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
well then obviously our netbook even

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.099 
well then obviously our netbook even
though<00:02:28.609> it's<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.819> low<00:02:29.030> powered<00:02:29.359> laptop<00:02:29.510> still<00:02:30.079> a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
though it's a low powered laptop still a

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.780 
though it's a low powered laptop still a
lot<00:02:30.319> more<00:02:30.439> powerful<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:30.950> terms<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.219> processing

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
lot more powerful in terms of processing

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.490 
lot more powerful in terms of processing
than<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.480> ipad<00:02:32.810> well<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.109> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.349> do<00:02:33.469> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
than the ipad well that's going to do a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.559 
than the ipad well that's going to do a
heck<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.829> lot<00:02:33.859> better<00:02:34.010> i'm<00:02:34.879> done<00:02:35.209> akron
