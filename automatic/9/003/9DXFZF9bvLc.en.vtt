know entertained them and because he's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
know entertained them and because he's
generally<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> nice<00:01:51.600> guy<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.140> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
generally just a nice guy you know but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
generally just a nice guy you know but
that<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.369> basically<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.939> thoughts<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that that's basically my thoughts on the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
that that's basically my thoughts on the
whole<00:01:54.540> prom<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.439> date<00:01:55.680> wasn't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
whole prom and going date wasn't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
whole prom and going date wasn't
necessary<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.540> episode<00:01:57.990> probably<00:01:58.619> not

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
necessary for this episode probably not

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.010 
necessary for this episode probably not
but<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.610> kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.479> necessary

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
but it also kind of was necessary

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
but it also kind of was necessary
because<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.530> need<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.159> palm<00:02:02.460> would

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
because we need to see how palm would

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.539 
because we need to see how palm would
react<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> Gahan<00:02:03.740> failing<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.040> bring<00:02:05.369> her<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
react to Gahan failing to bring her the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.940 
react to Gahan failing to bring her the
ngl<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> how<00:02:06.899> he<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.229> make<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.799> her

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
ngl and how he would make it up to her

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
ngl and how he would make it up to her
so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> thought<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> nice<00:02:09.179> touch<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so I thought it was a nice touch to the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.949 
so I thought it was a nice touch to the
episode

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
episode

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.839

the two things that really made this

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.210
