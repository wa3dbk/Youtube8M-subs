00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.840
 exceptional people who accept 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.879
 to give a second chance a dog 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.989
 who bit him what do you want me to 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.629

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.910
 like the others, that's it 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.690
 realize that I'm afraid she 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.580
 take it still pink so it's me 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.600
 who holds it there is no risk with 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.710
 you it's another story 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.660
 ok what are we taking in the first place 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.160
 these arv know how the masters of 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.539
 touch to interpret his reactions 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.179
 you never know if she will obey 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.740
 she is unpredictable and she is very 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.220
 protector of her house and her 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.539
 mistress her masters chatting to the cat 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.429
 is unpredictable but it is very rare 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.420
 that a dog is really needed 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.009
 simply that they are learning to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.959
 understand what she says to them for 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.270
 better encircle to the cat Caesar decides to 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.090
 bring in your junior dog according to you 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.390
 what do she do there she submits no it's 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.459
 true it's a hunting position if 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.020
 she is about to jump 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.640
 and yeah I think you do understand 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.130
 not what she tells you and that's why 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.450
 that you find it unpredictable 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.680
 diana think that any cat was submitting 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.720
 while this was not the case at all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.120
 she was in hunting position ready to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.410
 attack if it's never easy to 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.060
 work with masters who think 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.440
 know their dogs when they do not 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 do not know how to analyze his behavior 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.390
 I will take the leash to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.180
 determine the origin of the aggressiveness of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.230
 Caesar touches him to junior me 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.670
 I'm going to present and juniors 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.800
 really I have over four having 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.270
 a lot of you never let touch 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.580
 to approach another dog for fear 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.580
 that she attacks who is not afraid that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:45.230
 very early cat sought to jump on 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.970
 junior Caesar has to pull on the leash 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.970
 with a snap to force her to calm down 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.640
 when me a beautiful future otherwise yes 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 okay you put him right behind the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.480
 ears as in canine competitions 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.120
 Caesar changes the game to relax 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.740
 touched he places this one at the top of his 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.960
 skull to control it more easily 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:18.500
 that way he can serenely 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:20.830
 introduce junior to the student the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.830
 sniff 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.829
 tauch has accepted that junior sniff it 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.870
 proves that is not aggressive by nature 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.459
 she does not even try to bite her 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.379
 has no problem of aggressiveness 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.209
 the concern is that you leave it 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.430
 get upset and feel the need of you 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.650
 protect 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.420
 alright I suspected as soon as I 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.209
 saw diana walk shopping stretched like a 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.780
 bow and using the ess tauch to directs 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.519
 the walk 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.950
 so they are responsible for the 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.290
 protection of his mistress that's why 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.730
 that she is also aggressive Caesar 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.530
 must therefore teach the masters no 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.829
 touched to regain control of the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.829
 walk
