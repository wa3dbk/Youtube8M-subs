00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
definitely propel themselves into a much
bigger<00:01:58.710> higher<00:01:59.310> standing<00:02:00.000> than<00:02:00.119> they're<00:02:00.299> at

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
bigger higher standing than they're at

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289 
bigger higher standing than they're at
now<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> great

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
now so I think this will be a great

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
now so I think this will be a great
fight<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.500> only<00:02:04.649> hope<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.250> social

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
fight I can only hope that the social

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
fight I can only hope that the social
media<00:02:05.880> continues<00:02:06.329> from<00:02:06.630> both<00:02:06.840> sides<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
media continues from both sides the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
media continues from both sides the
antics<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.970> looking<00:02:09.270> at<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
antics so I think we be looking at a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
antics so I think we be looking at a
terrific<00:02:09.840> fight<00:02:10.050> between<00:02:10.700> Broner<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> Colin

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
terrific fight between Broner and Colin

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.940 
terrific fight between Broner and Colin
and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.740 
and
why<00:02:13.069> not<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.430> NBC<00:02:13.849> sports<00:02:14.120> network<00:02:14.209> we<00:02:14.629> know

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
why not on NBC sports network we know

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.960 
why not on NBC sports network we know
that<00:02:14.930> NBC<00:02:15.379> got<00:02:15.590> great<00:02:15.830> viewership<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.819> with

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
that NBC got great viewership so with

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
that NBC got great viewership so with
the<00:02:17.060> advertisement<00:02:17.690> they<00:02:17.959> can<00:02:18.080> get<00:02:18.200> from<00:02:18.410> that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
the advertisement they can get from that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.619 
the advertisement they can get from that
I<00:02:18.739> think<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.160> could<00:02:19.280> be<00:02:19.340> still<00:02:19.700> be<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:20.000> very

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
I think that could be still be a very

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.500 
I think that could be still be a very
