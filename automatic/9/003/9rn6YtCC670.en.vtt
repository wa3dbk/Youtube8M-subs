00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
to take me about a year to build it I'm

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.940 
to take me about a year to build it I'm
going<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.550> build<00:01:10.700> everything<00:01:10.940> from<00:01:11.210> scratch

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
going to build everything from scratch

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.090 
going to build everything from scratch

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.900 
some of the plans for the building with
the<00:01:32.330> ideas<00:01:32.690> for<00:01:33.010> how<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.070> aquaponics<00:01:34.760> will

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
the ideas for how the aquaponics will

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.050 
the ideas for how the aquaponics will
work<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:36.160> also<00:01:37.160> want<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.490> thank<00:01:37.760> everybody

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.770 
for me reaching a thousand subscriber
mile<00:01:42.440> mark<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.850> pretty<00:01:44.030> good<00:01:44.210> for<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
mile mark it's pretty good for the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.440 
mile mark it's pretty good for the
aquaponics<00:01:45.440> folks<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.940> quite<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
aquaponics folks not quite like the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.760 
aquaponics folks not quite like the
millions<00:01:47.810> or<00:01:47.900> so<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.290> some<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.620> other

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
with what we do with the aquaponics

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.280 
with what we do with the aquaponics
world<00:01:56.510> so<00:01:56.870> thanks<00:01:57.200> again<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.960> plan

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
world so thanks again this is the plan

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.020 
world so thanks again this is the plan
that<00:02:00.440> was<00:02:00.590> needed<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> obtain<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.670> wetlands

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
that was needed to obtain the wetlands

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.090 
that was needed to obtain the wetlands
permit<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.570> shows<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.110> existing<00:02:03.530> land<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
permit it shows the existing land and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.430 
permit it shows the existing land and
outlines<00:02:04.730> what<00:02:04.940> type<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.360> grading<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.050> types

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
outlines what type of grading and types

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.139 
outlines what type of grading and types
of<00:02:06.620> erosion<00:02:06.950> control<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.940> will<00:02:08.060> be

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
of erosion control that will be

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.849 
of erosion control that will be
installed<00:02:08.689> to<00:02:08.869> protect<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.349> wetlands<00:02:09.739> that
