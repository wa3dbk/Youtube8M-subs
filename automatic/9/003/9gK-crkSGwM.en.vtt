00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
future seasons or is it just a tease for

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.990 
future seasons or is it just a tease for
something<00:03:15.670> else

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
something else

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.610 
something else
personally<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.840> think<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.170> he's<00:03:17.380> just

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
personally I think that he's just

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740 
personally I think that he's just
clearing<00:03:17.829> space<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.700> cast<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.390> new

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
clearing space in the cast for new

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.930 
clearing space in the cast for new
characters<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.500> season<00:03:20.680> 8<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.910> a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
characters in season 8 I think that a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.870 
characters in season 8 I think that a
Clara<00:03:22.299> doctor<00:03:22.780> series<00:03:23.500> 8<00:03:23.739> will<00:03:24.519> be<00:03:24.549> much

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
Clara doctor series 8 will be much

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.670 
Clara doctor series 8 will be much
better<00:03:25.239> without<00:03:25.570> being<00:03:25.989> weighed<00:03:26.200> down<00:03:26.230> by<00:03:26.470> all

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
better without being weighed down by all

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
better without being weighed down by all
these<00:03:26.950> old<00:03:27.250> characters<00:03:27.760> although<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.510> know

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
these old characters although you know

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.690 
these old characters although you know
hopefully<00:03:28.750> we'll<00:03:29.049> see<00:03:29.200> maybe<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.590> few<00:03:29.950> cameos<00:03:30.459> I

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
hopefully we'll see maybe a few cameos I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.850 
hopefully we'll see maybe a few cameos I
would<00:03:31.209> like<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.540> see<00:03:31.720> some<00:03:32.049> new<00:03:32.230> characters<00:03:32.709> on

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
more on how it fits into the series as a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.819 
more on how it fits into the series as a
whole<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.480> episode<00:03:49.930> was<00:03:50.200> specifically

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
whole this episode was specifically

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.979 
whole this episode was specifically
intended<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.700> resolve<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.269> Clara<00:03:52.540> mystery

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
intended to resolve the Clara mystery

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.870 
intended to resolve the Clara mystery
and<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.590> set<00:03:53.739> up<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:53.950> 50th<00:03:54.310> anniversary

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
and to set up the 50th anniversary

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.759 
and to set up the 50th anniversary
episode<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.510> thought<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.260> did<00:03:56.470> both<00:03:56.709> of

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
episode I thought that it did both of

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.800 
episode I thought that it did both of
those<00:03:57.040> things<00:03:57.370> very<00:03:57.459> well<00:03:57.820> but<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.600> have<00:03:58.720> to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
those things very well but you have to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.720 
those things very well but you have to
listen<00:03:59.170> very<00:03:59.320> carefully<00:03:59.799> just<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.489> go<00:04:00.609> into

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
listen very carefully just to go into

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.220 
listen very carefully just to go into
the<00:04:00.850> Clara<00:04:01.090> mystery<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> little<00:04:01.720> bit<00:04:01.810> more<00:04:01.989> I

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
the Clara mystery a little bit more I

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.449 
the Clara mystery a little bit more I
thought<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.560> Moffat<00:04:02.829> had<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.070> much<00:04:03.310> easier

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
thought that Moffat had a much easier

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.610 
thought that Moffat had a much easier
job<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.180> resolving<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.780> storyline<00:04:05.200> than

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
job of resolving that storyline than

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.140 
job of resolving that storyline than
setting<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.190> 50th<00:04:06.579> anniversary<00:04:07.120> episode

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
setting up the 50th anniversary episode

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.360 
setting up the 50th anniversary episode
without<00:04:07.810> giving<00:04:08.200> too<00:04:08.380> many<00:04:08.500> things<00:04:08.859> away<00:04:09.160> I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
without giving too many things away I

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.800 
without giving too many things away I
thought<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.910> whole<00:04:10.120> Trail<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.450> Tears

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
thought that that whole Trail of Tears

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.960 
thought that that whole Trail of Tears
resolution<00:04:11.560> was<00:04:11.829> really<00:04:12.070> poignant<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.670> even

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
resolution was really poignant and even

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.180 
resolution was really poignant and even
gave<00:04:13.209> me<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.390> few<00:04:13.540> tears<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.200> John<00:04:14.560> Hurt<00:04:14.829> reveal

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
gave me a few tears the John Hurt reveal

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.099 
gave me a few tears the John Hurt reveal
on<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.609> other<00:04:15.910> hand<00:04:16.239> was<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.510> little<00:04:16.810> bit<00:04:16.930> more

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
on the other hand was a little bit more

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
on the other hand was a little bit more
mysterious<00:04:17.289> I<00:04:18.010> really<00:04:18.400> feel<00:04:18.549> like<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.760> have

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
mysterious I really feel like you have

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.399 
mysterious I really feel like you have
to<00:04:19.000> listen<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.419> what<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.659> character<00:04:20.019> says

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
to listen to what that character says

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.950 
to listen to what that character says
and<00:04:20.620> based<00:04:20.919> on<00:04:21.099> that<00:04:21.159> I<00:04:21.669> think<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.630> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
and based on that I think that the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.779 
and based on that I think that the
anniversary<00:04:23.530> episode<00:04:23.620> will<00:04:24.100> basically<00:04:24.340> be

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
anniversary episode will basically be

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.029 
anniversary episode will basically be
David<00:04:25.240> Tennant<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.720> Matt<00:04:26.020> Smith<00:04:26.320> trying<00:04:26.919> to

guessing<00:05:13.060> that's<00:05:13.270> what<00:05:13.539> Moffat<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.110> going<00:05:14.349> to

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
guessing that's what Moffat is going to

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.100 
guessing that's what Moffat is going to
use<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.979> bring<00:05:15.280> David<00:05:15.820> Tennant<00:05:16.270> on<00:05:16.389> screen<00:05:16.840> I'm

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
use to bring David Tennant on screen I'm

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.110 
use to bring David Tennant on screen I'm
also<00:05:17.349> guessing<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.190> four<00:05:18.430> doctors<00:05:18.699> will

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
also guessing that the four doctors will

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.089 
also guessing that the four doctors will
battle<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.509> John<00:05:19.840> Hurt<00:05:20.050> doctor<00:05:20.380> across<00:05:20.770> time

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
battle the John Hurt doctor across time

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.339 
battle the John Hurt doctor across time
and<00:05:21.250> space<00:05:21.310> think<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.120> like<00:05:22.240> TARDIS<00:05:22.930> vs.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
and space think of it like TARDIS vs.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.969 
and space think of it like TARDIS vs.
TARDIS<00:05:23.919> until<00:05:24.580> they're<00:05:24.729> able<00:05:24.849> to<00:05:25.180> redeem<00:05:25.539> him

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
TARDIS until they're able to redeem him

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.230 
TARDIS until they're able to redeem him
even<00:05:26.979> though<00:05:27.130> we're<00:05:27.250> not<00:05:27.370> gonna<00:05:27.490> see<00:05:27.789> any<00:05:28.000> new
