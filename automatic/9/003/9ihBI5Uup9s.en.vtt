00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.510
 Let's start by peeling the pear with a 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.610
 peeler is a task that becomes very 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.960
 easily the truth I have used a 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.640
 Pear conference for this recipe because 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.730
 is more complete with the help of a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.800
 mandolin we are taking out the slices of 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.710
 very much careful with your fingers 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.320
 that in one of these you can leave also 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.870
 a slice of so always the hand 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.360
 above the piece that we are 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.559
 cutting like that is how we look like you see 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.180
 we have released 6 pear discs we take a 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.430
 little cold cuts of ham 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 and we also get the slices 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.550
 now with the help of a short pasta 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.309
 a hoop of emplatar we are going to remove 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.130
 the portions so that we all have 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 of the same size then I have started 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.409
 with the ham and we do the same with 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.900
 the pieces of pear that is much more 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.690
 easy squeezing a bit as you see 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.640
 pretty good and we will have the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.670
 discs of the same size both those of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.650
 ham like those of the pear with the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.780
 cuts what we 're going to do is chop it 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.630
 we chop it so that we stay in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.000
 squares 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.740
 both cuts pears as 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.890
 cuts of ham in this case are a 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.010
 little smaller but good if you leave 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.870
 bigger as you can 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:45.180
 add it also without problems and we are going to 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.530
 cut a little onion and a 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.370
 little green pepper 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.909
 in squares 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.549
 once we have it cut 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.310
 We put a little oil 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.250
 olive in a pan and when you are 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.850
 hot add the onion 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 and then the pepper the pepper 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.760
 green and we're going to let it cook 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.920
 especially the pepper so that we do not 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.480
 let's not be left raw but not much 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.900
 because we are looking for a thin crust 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.040
 we add next in the cuts of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.040
 pear and ham 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.019
 and we let cook all the whole 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.330
 As we sautÃ© , we move it to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.900
 to cook everything equally and in another 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:46.510
 pan apart let's fry the discs 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.909
 of ham and the pear discs the time 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.010
 of cooking both of ones and of others 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.800
 it is practically the same is the same 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.020
 then we can do them at the same time 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.870
 it's not that we have it golden on one side 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.800
 we turn it over so that we 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.800
 double on the other 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.800
 As you can see the pear takes a golden color 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.130
 because the natural sugars 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.340
 caramelize is a pretty color 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 pretty interesting 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 the cuts we add a trickle of 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.300
 vinegar 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 cider vinegar for example and also 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.040
 We have put a splash of juice 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.290
 lemon 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.019
 and we let it reduce but not much for 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.079
 we have left some liquid and is 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.829
 time to mount the plate we are putting 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.359
 with the help of the hoop we use to cut 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.359
 ham and pear discs 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.730
 and once we have the last disc 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.440
 We remove the hoop and we are left in the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 very nice very artistic strudel and you 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.520
 we add the cuttings plus onion and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.560
 pepper as a garnish 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.680
 and we do not have any sauce, we put it 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.900
 over in my case has reduced quite a bit and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.400
 It has stayed that way I hope that I have 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.400
 liked until another
