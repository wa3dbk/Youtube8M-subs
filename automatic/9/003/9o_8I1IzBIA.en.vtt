00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 oh hello dear youtube i am zentek 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.340
 professionals and this is a little video to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 ipad 2 in terms of gaming or too 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.050
 In other words, what does ipad 2 do? 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.800
 actually so attractive so have fun 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.800
 at the video 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.520
 one of the main reasons why you choose one 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.830
 ipad2 increases is yes either the camera 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.460
 So the two cameras it has now 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.140
 or it 's the new hardware in there 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 is the video card 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.390
 especially the one very very very 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.540
 to deliver much better services 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.059
 unlike the camera in the ipad 1 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.879
 is installed some game was yes too 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.840
 So already revised for a better 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.760
 get a graphic 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.040
 one of these games is, for example 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.860
 infinity blade and also racing age the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.520
 and real racing 2 is now too 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.740
 game 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.960
 what I want to discuss in more detail in this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.180
 video and I have a lot there 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.790
 interesting video seen from the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.210
 Developers of real racing each the 2 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.259
 where they show that they have the ipad 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.220
 and with this new double that is 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:29.390
 a connector on edge tm dongle on the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.640
 one with the one the ipad 2 to the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.209
 TV can connect and all 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.509
 so can also reflect the game and 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:42.200
 the game uses that and gives 1080p 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.539
 resolution to the television continues and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.130
 on the ipad itself you can do things 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.869
 how to see the route so I show 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.459
 Just do it here because of me 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.950
 Show a few pictures so you 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.390
 make yourself a picture of it 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.619
 and I just link here 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.630
 time up here 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.929
 the video what you then synonymous times 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.970
 can look like the whole because in act 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.250
 In action, I find it very much 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.399
 impressive that ipad 2s 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.950
 manages to spend 1080p and in one 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.690
 actually how to get it from one 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.870
 Playstation 2 was used to it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.660
 or accustomed perhaps 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.209
 a bit over but for 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.700
 I personally am still one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.480
 This tablet is very impressive 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.849
 been 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 and that raises the question 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.209
 how does it look like with the gamen 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.310
 The gaming will evolve like that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.310
 maybe an ipad seen in the long term 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.010
 replace the game consoles 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.349
 So an Xbox 360 or what then 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.840
 comes or a playstation 3 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.730
 the graphics also technically still far 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.480
 This is not allowed in the ipad 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.000
 to forget 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
 but if we do it all the time 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.150
 seen in the longer term 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.500
 possibilities the ipad offers 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.209
 of course a bit stupid with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.720
 he plays this double tuned to it 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.120
 in the way and interferes with the steering network and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 you have such a hdmi cable across 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.890
 The room is not the best 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.720
 solution would be really cool if it were so cool 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.840
 It would be about airplay and man 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.080
 sends the signal to the apple tv and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.910
 He then gives it to the TV 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.540
 You could re-dial the cable 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 save up 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.599
 and maybe what in the future where 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.739
 Apple could work on it 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.180
 but I see this whole 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.540
 Game story on the ipad 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.620
 but have very positive towards the beginning 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.709
 I did not expect that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.330
 ipad so a game can be blatant 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.890
 as it has become now 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.989
 Many people just buy that 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.739
 ipad is a great game for you 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.600
 can play 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.970
 and yes, there are also through the app store 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.430
 a huge number of play for that 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.780
 are available and also first class 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.799
 Titles are the big ones 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.230
 software manufacturers already have 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.000
 all started for the app store too 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.810
 develop so there you are good 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.880
 canceled 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.010
 There is no such thing elsewhere 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.840
 For the other tablets, this is the moment 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.579
 one can go there on the market at all 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.600
 not even counting 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.359
 and yes I just ask you now 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.980
 I ask the room now what's up 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.920
 you of that now of this whole 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.720
 gaming history with the ipad as is 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.989
 you against what do you believe it will be 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.470
 to replace game consoles or 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.520
 is something that comes to what a 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.039
 other type of game also allows 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.289
 of course, though, through the sensors 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.389
 replace the traditional consoles 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.860
 or not what do you think you wanted me to do 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.930
 We are interested in your opinion 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.030
 if you now the new video quality 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.620
 like it then we would be happy if 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.810
 Do it with a thumbs up 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.550
 expresses and we are happy 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.670
 on it more videos in this quality 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.890
 to be able to do 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.440
 and for all those videos not 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.490
 want to miss 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.050
 is subscribing to my head 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.910
 button you should then maybe 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.740
 press times so I'm fine 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.860
 now from the pros and I'm out 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.860
 People
