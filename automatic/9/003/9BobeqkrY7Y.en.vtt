00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
my experiences working for a magic trick

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000 
my experiences working for a magic trick
company<00:00:47.039> long<00:00:47.309> ago<00:00:48.170> there<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> trick<00:00:49.739> where

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
company long ago there is a trick where

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
company long ago there is a trick where
a<00:00:50.039> red<00:00:50.340> foam<00:00:50.640> ball<00:00:51.030> appears<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> disappears

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a red foam ball appears and disappears

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
a red foam ball appears and disappears
then<00:00:52.829> reappears<00:00:53.489> somewhere<00:00:54.030> else<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:55.199> works

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
then reappears somewhere else this works

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
then reappears somewhere else this works
because<00:00:55.829> there's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.480> three<00:00:57.870> foam

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because there's not one but three foam

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.560 
because there's not one but three foam
balls<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.800> begin<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.239> hidden

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
balls to begin with two of them hidden

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.830 
balls to begin with two of them hidden
here's<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> use<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.640> effect<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.600> move

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
here's how I use that effect to move

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
here's how I use that effect to move
objects<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.739> Maya<00:01:06.560> basically<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.740> start<00:01:08.220> off

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
objects in Maya basically I start off

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.730 
objects in Maya basically I start off
with<00:01:08.549> three<00:01:08.850> cubes<00:01:09.210> cubed<00:01:09.720> number<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.619> the

the final destination with a series of
keyframes<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.939> move<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> hand<00:01:22.080> over<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.189> pick

keyframes I move the hand over to pick

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
keyframes I move the hand over to pick
up<00:01:23.430> cube<00:01:23.939> number<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.140> becomes<00:01:25.619> cube
