00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.860

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.620
 Salvadorian Salvadoran and we put ourselves 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.050
 disque invent to think tacos 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.970

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.400
 we are all copying we do not know shit 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.980

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.980
 you are copying day and you are copying 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.170
 of that - look here we have the meat 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.170
 supposedly roast meat 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.150
 we look for meat in the waters so 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.440
 like everyone to cheat that does not have 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.050
 nothing to see 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.940

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.970
 it will continue because you call it tortillas 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.460
 Mexicans because the tortillas that 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.180

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.900

 recipe here for you by means of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.720
 televisa they hired me already so that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.270
 Tortillas know I'm far from

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.250
 he is huggel but he stands out in a small 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.230
 It was the Lord, what would it be like? 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.660
 maybe you have us tell you in 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.660
 gas for joking the tortillas since 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.090
 they are hot they are missing a lot 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.200
 we would put two such gentlemen and we are going to 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.740
 see him we would throw his respective meat 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.959
 remember that these are tacos al 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.240
 style of us be inventing 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.470
 they are not even Salvadoran income 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.200
 because we become so 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.450
 we make pupusas soya 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.670
 we would throw here 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.070
 and rivers that do want 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.840
 but here they are making fun of me because 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:35.770
 He says that I do not know what it would be like if 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.770
 we throw their respective guacamole check 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.100

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.070
 that are poor man's tacos because they look and 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.500
 they filled and that more would be missing good 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.910
 it would be the chile chile sauce that 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.650
 itch because we have not done it and there 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.650
 are the lords tacks look 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.140

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.759

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.369
 pinches tacos that we are doing 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.899

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:11.169
 that gives like pity everybody and goes to 

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:12.609
 mock but good so when we're 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.189

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:17.279
 we can invent that eating today 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.869
 He went back to the lemon but good 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.749
 that is the example of more or less know 

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:25.779
