00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.550
 Everyone already explained it in a video 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.589

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.030

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.610
 gate you also have it in what is the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.900
 description I think it's a game type 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 league of legends him 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 do not pay much attention to me because it is that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
 I could see it, I'm giving it for what 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 I was told or what I was reading by 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.510
 15 sports games that good but not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 have like that in a lot of public here in 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 Spain then I'll leave you too 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 description of the gameplay a 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.900
 completely the fcd bruce link e 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 I will try to buy the game also that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.480
 I liked it quite an example later 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 also from the sims 4 a trailer then 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.250
 what more to see that I lose in a game 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 1 criterion game also a game 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 so good looking style would be like this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.590
 as extreme sports games we 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.119
 see if mola mola or not the the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.220
 descriptions but quite expected a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.979
 burnout but in the end it could not be and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 then also a dragon age video 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 inquisition that he could not know either 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 so spectacular all and as I say 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 trying to fix what the strike is that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.760
 could not come at a worse time not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.190
 It could have happened yesterday or tomorrow but 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.930
 today, it has been the means aimed not 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.560
 be many thanks to fuck 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.560
 from fuck to thank you thank you very much or 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.510
 either they may have warned or something before 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 get me what you tell me you can not put 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.720
 that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.130
 but good to see that the pussy we 're going to 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.270
 make everything last 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.620
 since it is what exceeds and as I say 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.610
 they are making a trailer of the batel 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 set line of remembrance that you can 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.710
 download the beta for accuracy 4 and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 for pc already and you can play I think that since 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.250
 with which then go to download it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 right you know all the psn I think the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.550
 origin has not been squeezed too but it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.040
 they will lend brief if we are still tight 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.720
 and nothing like I say stop the experiment 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.190
 of the toilet to fix the line they are playing 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.570
 Now I'm just like that, just one 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.770
 kids this was noticed we're not going anywhere 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.770
 the next video until the next show
