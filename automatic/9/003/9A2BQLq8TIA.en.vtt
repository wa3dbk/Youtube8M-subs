00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
because even a yag tiger will just sit

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.650 
because even a yag tiger will just sit
and<00:04:09.650> burn<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.340> death<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:14.300> that's<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
and burn to death so that's the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.690 
and burn to death so that's the
left-hand<00:04:15.080> flank<00:04:15.350> also<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.190> pretty<00:04:16.459> much

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
left-hand flank also not pretty much

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.640 
left-hand flank also not pretty much
unless<00:04:16.970> there<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.269> any<00:04:17.570> lingering<00:04:18.139> actually

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
unless there is any lingering actually

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.409 
unless there is any lingering actually
this<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.250> game's<00:04:19.609> pretty<00:04:19.880> even<00:04:20.239> at<00:04:20.329> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
this the game's pretty even at the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.849 
this the game's pretty even at the
moment<00:04:20.720> they're<00:04:20.810> actually<00:04:21.049> losing<00:04:21.440> by<00:04:21.590> one

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
moment they're actually losing by one

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.790 
moment they're actually losing by one
kill<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.720> should<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.110> quite<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.650> few

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
kill so there should be quite a few

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.730 
kill so there should be quite a few
