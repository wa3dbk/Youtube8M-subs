00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 you guys it's joe I hope you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.790
 go well we meet today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.620
 for the news of this fifa 16 on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.420
 would do a little bit of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.800
 all sides on the internet try to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 see if there would be some small ones 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
 rumors some gossip that we're going 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.980
 say would hang around on the net about 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 fipa 16 and I would have found a few 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.650
 that I take you in this video 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 know that there is no guarantee of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.890
 sailly be in any case me I went 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 see pretty much right on the left and I 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 you brought all that in a video 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.539
 to see pretty much what would be the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 more likely to see happen on this 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.910
 fifa 16 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 we order directly from 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.579
 better graphics here I do not 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.750
 not necessarily comment by the heaviest 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.399
 the heaviest I reserve the heaviest 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 after one of the best graphics we know 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.050
 that they want to make better use of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 next gen they believed it says repeated the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 next-gen it is not yet exploited 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.510
 at its maximum and I think the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 next fifa will still be a level at 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 above level graphic design it's for me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 it's still below a ghetto 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.710
 someone and it's true that they can 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 tend to make better graphics 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 and better exploit this next gen 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 we are also talking about new models of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 joy in quotes you have a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 some players are modeled very well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 finally they see how they say they 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 take archive photos in all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.760
 the angles and then after they created 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.409
 super well done players because he 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.210
 spoke to what would appear he would do it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.560
 on a lot more players and so a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 bigger database better done 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 we follow with a new interface 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 a tournament interface that would be called 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.060
 I do not really know one these yet 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 rather blurry to what I tell you a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 interface tournament as measures are 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.600
 rumors 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.400
 these are some things we do not really know 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 is true a tournament interface that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.979
 will facilitate the competition 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.150
 on philippe favre 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.070
 it's true that it's not because loving 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.619
 archive assumes to do a competition 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.150
 either on leakage or in normal mode 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 there would be a new fashion that's true 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 our competition we can do that of 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.549
 the compet with that people finally that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.380
 would facilitate tournaments 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.640
 precisely on fifa and tournaments 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.540
 may have wars in the end I do not know 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520
 not in any case 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.350
 li fifa sports that would be a little more 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 worked on those who passed with 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.259
 maybe new competition mode is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 maybe the possibility of doing some 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.890
 competitions between friends we follow with 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.600
 maybe new licenses 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.399
 so yes every year we will come 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.090
 what new licenses including the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.990
 Brazilian league 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.729
 we tell ourselves when is she going 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.350
 come back at night they even feared the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.790
 qatar with really interesting people 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 we're wondering all this but right now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.710
 I think what I heard he would be 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.690
 more enters to give 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 OTIE League rights of europa 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.260
 champions league as you know 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.700
 in career mode 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.020
 the league of champions is not called 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 the help of the champions and the europa 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.420
 league no more why because they 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.709
 do not have the rights to these 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.630
 championships finally on these couples 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.830
 adjustments and he would like precisely the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.630
 acquire for the next fifa 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.739
 it is true that it is not necessarily archi 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.020
 interesting I would prefer they 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.550
 acquire therefore the russian league 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.590
 Ukrainian that of Qatar 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.060
 even those of Brazil rather than acquiring 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.500
 just in the end just the names because 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.360
 that's just what they're trying 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.530
 to acquire good start for many 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.209
 a lot of money they try 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.980
 to ultimately acquire just a name a 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.230
 ehning and I find that a bit of a bit 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.090
 shame we go on immediately 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.560
 again commentator so that all 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.760
 angles we have it every year they 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.500
 perhaps say new 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.150
 commentators need teasing etc 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.190
 but this opinion is precise and a small 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.440
 little more I heard that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.540
 English commentators side would there be a 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.800
 gagarin and city and michael owen so 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 a new presenters to what 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.070
 seems he would keep the old ones but they 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.450
 we would add new ones would be 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.650
 vintage in career mode is in mode car 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.780
 precisely we would have how 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 is called we can not have again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 commentator but only for the mode 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 career that will be special for 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.630
 some matches some events and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.980
 cetera that could really create a 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.420
 really interesting fashion career thing 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.130
 you would not be online meeting would not 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.390
 always in the good old the good ones 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.130
 old commentators usually but we 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.890
 could have some times again 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.420
 commentator for certain events 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.709
 then maybe then that's the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.360
 big rumor a toy does not hide a 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.130
 online career mode mons has frozen seen 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.930
 many much back yes strong without 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.910
 necessarily a lot of sources in this 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.380
 who was told I can talk about it more than 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.250
 that but here I balance you like that 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.690
 you do what you want you 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.160
 can dream that's why I'm 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.660
 there too to make you dream fashion 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.590
 online career is playing with his friends and 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.269
 my career or with other 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.959
 people I balance you like that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.390
 but it's a rumor 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.860
 then a new level of difficulty 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.480
 in any case one or more I do not have 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.250
 well understood I think she will have a 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.540
 again because these rules since fifa 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.190
 I do not know how much we always have 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.690
 same levels of difficulty so each 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.100
 year the renault millet etc 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.690
 but in the end it remains the same levels 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.190
 is what seems like there might be 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.420
 new levels of difficulty the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.720
 intermediate levels between each 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.980
 level 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.420
 because it's true that a lot of 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.920
 people complain that the difficulty in 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 professional and international coop finally 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.090
 champion I believe too much and champion is 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.670
 far too high that prog n 6 0 and in 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.660
 champions we are bursting 3-0 and the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.250
 people complain about not having a 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.160
 intermediate level and is what 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.690
 seems prepared there is ready and to make a 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.780
 intermediate mode between pro and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.489
 international 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.139
 we go on with a better 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.030
 artificial intelligence of the guards 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.470
 indeed good there it will not necessarily 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.330
 a big novelty will be more a patch 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.620
 because it's true you know they 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.130
 are disgusting the guards on this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.139
 figure at 15 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.669
 but it's true that on fip at 16 he 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.090
 would tend to want better 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.650
 guardian 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.790
 good they would not change it's for their 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.260
 way a volley but no longer their 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.669
 artificial intelligence in the fact 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.990
 that he would stop from gaulle and no matter 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.370
 how he would make more errors of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.040
 shit but he would always have the same 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.540
 way of gaulle is in quotation marks 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.940
 more we might have new 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.440
 animations for injuries then share 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.360
 by that I 'm going to hear you know when 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.800
 your players get hurt we never saw 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.690
 one day to take an arm or take 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.620
 the foot he gets each time at the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.970
 leg we do not know why 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.280
 sometimes he's hurt not lynching not 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.870
 to the arm or to the head and he surrenders 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.680
 every time the foot at it seems there 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.930
 would have news we will say animation 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.400
 which will precisely make it better 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.330
 the realistic game and not that your player 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.830
 as soon as they get hurt even though it's up to 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.540
 the head they take their foot as 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.710
 a shot I look a little my notes I 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.479
 look if I told you everything I'm trying 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.680
 to make his rapine their graphics these 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.000
 ten best intelligences 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.520
 artificial sapling is to be 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.840
 facilitate tournaments as new 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.330
 animations for new wounds 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.260
 new commentator licenses 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.050
 of course the commentators I do not know 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.490
 if it is specified but it will of course 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.050
 we will look at the old ones but some 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.460
 will appear like that so it can 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.570
 really be nice career mode in 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.979
 line the little rumor that you swing 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.300
 a new difficulty mode 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.320
 here we are guys all know that 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.630
 I had to tell you about these two 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.220
