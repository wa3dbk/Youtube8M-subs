sport hybrid the idea behind this car is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.910 
sport hybrid the idea behind this car is
to<00:00:17.000> combine<00:00:17.210> sporty<00:00:17.930> attributes<00:00:18.410> of<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.680> small

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
to combine sporty attributes of a small

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.370 
to combine sporty attributes of a small
car<00:00:19.189> with<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.910> fuel<00:00:20.359> efficiency<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.050> hybrid

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
car with a fuel efficiency of a hybrid

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.590 
car with a fuel efficiency of a hybrid
powertrain<00:00:21.950> and<00:00:22.550> what<00:00:22.820> we've<00:00:22.970> done<00:00:23.180> is<00:00:23.390> we

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
powertrain and what we've done is we

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.640 
powertrain and what we've done is we
have<00:00:23.810> combined<00:00:24.260> a<00:00:25.360> gasoline<00:00:26.360> engine<00:00:26.650> similar

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
have combined a gasoline engine similar

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.650 
have combined a gasoline engine similar
to<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.800> one<00:00:27.920> in<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.039> Honda<00:00:28.340> Fit<00:00:28.520> with<00:00:29.270> the

to the one in the Honda Fit with the
hybrid<00:00:30.020> powertrain<00:00:30.590> similar<00:00:31.100> to<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.310> one

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
hybrid powertrain similar to the one

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.459 
hybrid powertrain similar to the one
behind<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.910> insight<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.930> we've<00:00:33.140> combined

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
behind the insight and we've combined

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.319 
behind the insight and we've combined
them<00:00:33.559> with<00:00:33.649> a<00:00:33.680> sporty<00:00:34.039> way<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.730> car<00:00:34.910> has<00:00:35.030> three

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
them with a sporty way the car has three

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.299 
them with a sporty way the car has three
modes<00:00:35.539> you<00:00:36.050> can<00:00:36.199> either<00:00:36.350> have<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.710> an<00:00:36.800> economy

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
modes you can either have it an economy

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.669 
modes you can either have it an economy
mode<00:00:37.489> for<00:00:37.789> maximum<00:00:38.149> fuel<00:00:38.329> efficiency<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:39.559> can

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
mode for maximum fuel efficiency you can

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.590 
mode for maximum fuel efficiency you can
have<00:00:39.800> an<00:00:39.890> enormous<00:00:40.129> just<00:00:41.089> for<00:00:41.210> normal<00:00:41.479> driving

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
have an enormous just for normal driving

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.110 
have an enormous just for normal driving
or<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.440> also<00:00:42.559> has<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.769> sport<00:00:43.159> mode<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:43.999> that

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
or it also has a sport mode and in that

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.840 
or it also has a sport mode and in that
sport<00:00:44.449> mode<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:44.749> get<00:00:45.199> enhanced<00:00:45.859> electric

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
sport mode you get enhanced electric

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.200 
sport mode you get enhanced electric
power<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:47.780> get<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:47.989> different<00:00:48.499> steering<00:00:48.920> feel

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
power you get a different steering feel

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.369 
power you get a different steering feel
really<00:00:50.210> feels<00:00:50.659> like<00:00:50.749> a<00:00:50.839> completely<00:00:51.260> different

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
really feels like a completely different

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.680 
really feels like a completely different
car<00:00:51.859> between<00:00:52.069> three<00:00:52.519> modes<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.389> it<00:00:53.479> kind<00:00:53.659> of

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
car between three modes so it kind of

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.379 
car between three modes so it kind of
gives<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:55.309> best<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.670> both<00:00:55.729> worlds<00:00:56.239> you

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:56.389 
gives you the best of both worlds you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.289 
gives you the best of both worlds you
get<00:00:56.510> really<00:00:57.319> no<00:00:58.010> compromises<00:00:58.729> on<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:58.999> sporty

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
get really no compromises on the sporty

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.509 
get really no compromises on the sporty
side<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.109> no<00:01:00.199> compromises<00:01:00.889> on<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.190> hybrid

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
side and no compromises on the hybrid

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.479 
side and no compromises on the hybrid
side<00:01:01.940> for<00:01:02.239> fuel<00:01:02.449> efficiency<00:01:03.250> what<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
side for fuel efficiency what is the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.880 
side for fuel efficiency what is the
average<00:01:05.170> mileage<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:06.560> car<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.490> car

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
average mileage for this car so this car

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.260 
average mileage for this car so this car
my<00:01:09.890> brain<00:01:10.160> is<00:01:10.310> not<00:01:10.340> storing<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:10.940> number

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
my brain is not storing that number

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.490 
my brain is not storing that number
right<00:01:11.420> now<00:01:12.010> 40

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.690 

40-some<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> guess<00:01:17.910> it's<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.310> I'll<00:01:20.310> need<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
40-some I guess it's like I'll need to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
40-some I guess it's like I'll need to
look<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.570> 41

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
look it up I think it's like 41

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.600 
look it up I think it's like 41
