00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
ice on everything it's slushy on the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.470 
ice on everything it's slushy on the
ground<00:01:02.900> you<00:01:03.900> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.030> ice<00:01:06.030> is

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
ground you can see how the ice is

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.440 
ground you can see how the ice is
burdening<00:01:07.230> these<00:01:07.620> evergreens<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.210> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
burdening these evergreens you can see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.690 
burdening these evergreens you can see
how<00:01:12.659> those<00:01:12.930> evergreens<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.920> leaning<00:01:14.310> way

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
how those evergreens are leaning way

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.490 
how those evergreens are leaning way
over<00:01:17.180> against<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.330> ice-filled<00:01:19.200> tree<00:01:19.800> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
over against this ice-filled tree and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.890 
over against this ice-filled tree and
then<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:28.100> view<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.430> ice<00:01:30.060> coating

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
then we have a view of the ice coating

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
then we have a view of the ice coating
which<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.310> much<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> ice

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
which is really not that much the ice

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.450 
which is really not that much the ice
coating<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.300> everything

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
coating on everything

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
coating on everything
so<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:39.700> where<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.299> broke

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:02:02.940 

there's<00:01:48.189> ice<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.670> everything<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> raining

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:13.500 

more<00:02:03.640> broken<00:02:04.240> limbs<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:07.570> tree<00:02:12.209> now<00:02:13.209> we're

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
more broken limbs on this tree now we're

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.809 
more broken limbs on this tree now we're
going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:16.200> intentionally<00:02:17.200> we're<00:02:17.819> watching

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
going to intentionally we're watching

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.570 
going to intentionally we're watching
where<00:02:19.060> we're<00:02:19.440> stepping<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> show<00:02:24.519> you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
where we're stepping going to show you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.729 
where we're stepping going to show you
something<00:02:25.120> else<00:02:25.300> before<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.170> camera<00:02:26.560> gets

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
something else before the camera gets

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.210 
something else before the camera gets
wet<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.430> raining<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.470> will<00:02:32.709> take<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
wet it is raining so it will take the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.600 
wet it is raining so it will take the
ice<00:02:33.370> off<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.910> everything<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:36.099> uncle<00:02:36.400> Steve

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
ice off of everything but uncle Steve

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.110 
ice off of everything but uncle Steve
wants<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.120> show<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.420> he<00:02:37.780> saw<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.519> Duke<00:02:39.519> Energy

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
wants to show you he saw a Duke Energy

truck come just in here less than a half
hour<00:02:45.519> ago<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.860> power<00:02:51.220> cable<00:02:53.250> this

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
hour ago this is not a power cable this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.300 
hour ago this is not a power cable this
is<00:02:54.459> probably<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:55.000> telephone<00:02:55.630> cable<00:02:57.090> feed<00:02:58.090> here

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.350 

now<00:03:02.910> since<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.569> end<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.050> attached<00:03:04.470> there

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
now since that end is attached there

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.750 
now since that end is attached there
that<00:03:06.360> means<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.349> what<00:03:07.680> fell<00:03:13.160> let<00:03:14.160> go<00:03:14.430> down

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
that means that what fell let go down

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.650 
that means that what fell let go down
there<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.980> reason<00:03:17.340> why<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.550> let<00:03:17.910> go<00:03:18.209> we

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
there and the reason why it let go we

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:30.600 
there and the reason why it let go we
can<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.230> now

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.910 

this<00:03:31.210> must<00:03:31.570> be<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> other

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.330 

this<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.250> reason<00:03:39.430> why<00:03:40.620> our<00:03:41.620> companies

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
this is the reason why our companies

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.550 
this is the reason why our companies
come<00:03:42.640> around<00:03:43.530> trying<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.739> trim<00:03:45.159> everything

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
come around trying to trim everything

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.740 
come around trying to trim everything
periodically<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:50.939> okay<00:03:51.939> that's<00:03:52.209> where<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
periodically but okay that's where it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.199 
periodically but okay that's where it
was<00:03:53.670> up<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.939> that<00:03:55.180> pole<00:03:55.569> there<00:03:56.819> see<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.969> cable

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
was up on that pole there see the cable

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.770 
was up on that pole there see the cable
is<00:03:58.569> here<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.760> here<00:04:00.760> are<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:00.969> branches<00:04:01.359> that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
is here and here are the branches that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:10.670 
is here and here are the branches that
broke<00:04:02.079> off<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:03.209> tree<00:04:08.790> winter<00:04:09.790> wonderland

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
broke off of this tree winter wonderland

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.300 
broke off of this tree winter wonderland
we<00:04:11.680> still<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:12.159> power<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:16.120> world<00:04:16.389> goes<00:04:16.750> on
