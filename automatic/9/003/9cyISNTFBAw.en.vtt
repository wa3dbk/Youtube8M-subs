00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the reason you look at this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.250
 video and because one of your friends 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.620
 talk about the opportunity to create a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.429
 business together with your friends 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 your friend obviously trust you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.759
 is of the opinion that you are perfect for this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.719
 business otherwise you would not be in the process 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 to watch this video 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 this opportunity we live in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.820
 talk is a good way to win a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 little money next to your activity 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.730
 principal whatever and studies or your 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.769
 job 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 however unlike a job 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.220
 normal you are not attached to a place of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.320
 work nor a fixed schedule 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 instead you share a product 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.279
 exceptional a great idea and you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410
 have the opportunity to meet all the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 new people time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 before entering more details of the status 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 on board 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.739
 my name is when a judge comes from 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 luxembourg i'm 20 years old and i'm in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 train my studies in economics at 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 st gall and just like you I heard 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 talk about this opportunity through a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.850
 of my friends 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.399
 just like paulo you homework 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.360
 have heard through me that makes 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.610
 five months that I am in this business 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.530
 and what speaks to me the most and makes that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 my income is directly related to my 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 effort without him having someone in me 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.989
 who tell me clothes side is already 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 do that mean I'm not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 paid a fixed rate per hour instead of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.119
 this my income and results directly 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 invested efforts 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.560
 that means more service 'efforts 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 in this business many are of money 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.330
 so what do we do concretely 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.560
 to get this income 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.090
 we work that company that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.110
 is called new hand the match 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.630
 food supplement company 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.240
 which was supplied in Arizona in 2004 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.440
 that is, she has only the word 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.340
 initially vma focused on the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.010
 US market 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.390
 but since 2013 emma began to have 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.550
 more and more impact on new 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 European markets this does not seem 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.640
 a real opportunity for you to know 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.370
 that currently less than 2000 people 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.050
 between 18 and 27 years old rubble etc departure to 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.570
 across europe while europe to 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.890
 over 700 million people then 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.460
 what do we do we do 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.920
 publicity 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 the business mode used by vma 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.160
 call each other accused and if 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.690
 you hear here for the first time 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.270
 this is business mode that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.470
 goes on a layer in May indeed the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.060
 most of us practice the mouth 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220
 by ear when I love years without really 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.660
 realize as an example let's say you 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.880
 spear the masts and watching the movie that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.830
 you really have therefore you will 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 talk with friends about this movie since 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.800
 your friends trust you they go to you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.550
 believe and most likely go 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.070
 watch this movie 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.420
 now or another time basically so you 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.520
 generated additional revenue for 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.050
 the cinematographic enterprise since 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.080
 friends to pay to watch this 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.000
 movie at the cinema 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.230
 however he will certainly not be 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 rewarded for bringing back the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.900
 new customers for most of them 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.180
 we are you look totally 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.830
 ridiculous nevertheless not going to do 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.540
 exactly opposite and pays his 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.880
 partners like me recommended was 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.440
 product to tell my friends like you this is 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.780
 logical since spending money 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.160
 in advertising to the magazine or brochure 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.230
 at the bottom of things we 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.550
 pay more attention but my realized 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.140
 than usual this own partners 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.120
 is the most important for his business 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.130
 and so chose to spend his budget 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.050
 in the recommendations of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.800
 partners allow me to you 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.180
 ask for something 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.100
 do you remember the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.280
 last TV ad on youtube 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 in a magazine you saw 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.640
 probably not since we are 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 bombarded daily with so much 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.700
 of different advertising that we 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.069
 simply choose that we there 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.840
 pay attention to what we do 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.580
 really care about our family 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.950
 love their opinion peace what they did not 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.650
 account then that being said what is the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.360
 message we want to pass on 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.220
 as a young generation we 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.810
 work with fear if you do not have 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.900

 most currently watched the drink 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.510

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.450

 possibility of creating a monthly withdrawal

 consistent with activities 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.860
 main 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.510
 compared to previous generations 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.090
 our generation has means of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.470
 communication more effective almost 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.870
 each of your acquaintances a

 nowadays it is extremely easy 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.000
 to stay in touch with your friends 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.950

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.050
 generation who did what facebook 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.610
 facebook is today and after all 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.560
 like dream have heard of 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.140

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.830
 he never had advertising ad ad 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.110
 for facebook 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.030
 basically it was us who would contribute to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.190
 Facebook's expansion and that made 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.110
 from billionaire mark zuckerberg 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.540
 the way of thinking from elsewhere guy 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.950
 prevost logis youth revolution is 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.030
 very different from that of the generations 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.160
 previous youth 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.440
 this movement is difficult to accept 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.270
 to exchange his most valuable asset the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.910
 time against a fixed income per hour 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.350
 like school of form to do it 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.110
 ask yourself yourself and you really 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.150
 of opinion that you are worth 5 10 or 50 euros or 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.560
 francs per hour you think you're worth 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.230

 because you are convinced of the product seen 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.110
 that you like the product you want in 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.600
