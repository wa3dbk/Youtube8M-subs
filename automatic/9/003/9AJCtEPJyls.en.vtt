is<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.070> wonderful<00:05:17.970> place<00:05:18.090> because<00:05:18.630> not<00:05:18.990> just

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
is a wonderful place because not just

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.480 
is a wonderful place because not just
because<00:05:19.440> of<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.590> protection<00:05:20.040> from<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.310> wind

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
because of the protection from the wind

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.820 
because of the protection from the wind
but<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.780> would<00:05:22.260> say<00:05:22.470> 99.9%<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.780> trail<00:05:25.470> if

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
but I would say 99.9% of the trail if

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.260 
but I would say 99.9% of the trail if
you<00:05:25.980> were<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.220> fall<00:05:26.460> out<00:05:26.700> of<00:05:26.730> your<00:05:26.880> canoe<00:05:27.150> or

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
you were to fall out of your canoe or

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.960 
you were to fall out of your canoe or
kayak<00:05:27.470> simply<00:05:28.470> stand<00:05:28.740> up<00:05:28.920> okay<00:05:29.520> collect
