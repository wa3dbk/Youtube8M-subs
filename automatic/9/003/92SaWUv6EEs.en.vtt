practice serves I focus on height over

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
practice serves I focus on height over
the<00:00:24.960> top<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> net<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.830> less<00:00:26.160> concerned

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the top of the net I'm less concerned

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.820 
the top of the net I'm less concerned
about<00:00:26.850> a<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.210> tight<00:00:27.480> spin<00:00:27.779> probably<00:00:28.619> not

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
about a really tight spin probably not

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.410 
about a really tight spin probably not
warmed<00:00:29.190> up<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.490> I'd<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.850> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.359> I'm

warmed up as I'd like to be so I'm

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600 
warmed up as I'd like to be so I'm
really<00:00:30.840> thinking<00:00:31.050> about<00:00:31.440> height<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
top of the net and if you can really get

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.210 
top of the net and if you can really get
a<00:00:36.239> nice<00:00:36.540> shape<00:00:37.199> where<00:00:37.530> you've<00:00:37.710> got<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.860> big

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
a nice shape where you've got a big

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.670 
a nice shape where you've got a big
big-time<00:00:38.970> rainbow<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:40.110> over<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.380> top<00:00:40.590> of

big-time rainbow going over the top of
the<00:00:40.739> net<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.100> still<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:41.820> applying<00:00:42.180> spin

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the net and still you're applying spin

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
the net and still you're applying spin
that<00:00:42.899> brings<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.470> second<00:00:43.950> serve<00:00:44.100> down

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that brings your second serve down

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
that brings your second serve down
inside<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> court<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> great

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
inside the court you really get a great

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
inside the court you really get a great
effect<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> terms<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> ball<00:00:48.210> bouncing<00:00:48.719> up

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
effect in terms of the ball bouncing up

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
effect in terms of the ball bouncing up
to<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.350> opponent<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.700> try<00:00:50.760> to

really<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.149> how<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.660> spin

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
really think about how could you spin

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
really think about how could you spin
the<00:01:16.350> ball<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.190> have<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.520> bring<00:01:18.000> itself

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the ball up and have it bring itself

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
back down a couple of the key things

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.580 
back down a couple of the key things
here<00:01:20.910> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.630> number<00:01:21.929> one<00:01:21.959> is<00:01:22.289> staying

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
here you know number one is staying

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.669 
here you know number one is staying
sideways<00:01:23.459> through<00:01:23.819> contact<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:25.080> opening<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
sideways through contact not opening up

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.040 
sideways through contact not opening up
too<00:01:25.890> early<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.300> here<00:01:27.599> and<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> get

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
too early so if you get here and you get

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.199 
too early so if you get here and you get
turned<00:01:28.349> too<00:01:28.619> early<00:01:29.099> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.580> everything

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
turned too early you know everything

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:31.580 
turned too early you know everything
wants<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.599> go<00:01:30.750> over<00:01:30.929> to<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.110> left<00:01:31.289> so<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
wants to go over to your left so you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.150 
wants to go over to your left so you
need<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.099> stay<00:01:32.310> sideways<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.160> really

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
need to stay sideways on this and really

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.309 
need to stay sideways on this and really
go<00:01:35.399> for<00:01:35.429> some<00:01:35.700> racket<00:01:36.209> speed<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.660> don't<00:01:37.140> let

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
go for some racket speed don't don't let

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.109 
go for some racket speed don't don't let
that<00:01:37.500> racket<00:01:37.770> speed<00:01:38.099> slow<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.550> right<00:01:38.759> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that racket speed slow down right right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.540 
that racket speed slow down right right
right<00:01:39.360> prior<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.929> contact<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.619> really

right prior to contact and really

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.820 
right prior to contact and really
practice<00:01:42.149> height<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:43.020> high<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.319> can<00:01:43.649> get

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
practice height see how high you can get

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.010 
practice height see how high you can get
that<00:01:44.039> second<00:01:44.520> serve<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.179> go<00:01:45.330> up<00:01:45.450> over<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.750> top

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that second serve to go up over the top

that second serve to go up over the top
of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> net<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.560> eventually<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.429> you<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of the net and eventually when you you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
of the net and eventually when you you
know<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.300> control<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.050> you'll<00:01:49.289> really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
know get control that you'll really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.169 
know get control that you'll really
start<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.099> a<00:01:50.130> great<00:01:50.369> feel<00:01:50.580> for<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> spin

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
start to get a great feel for the spin
