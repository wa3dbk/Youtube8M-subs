00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
get started again we want to lift up the
ear<00:01:48.600> flap<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.010> ahead<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
ear flap and we're going to go ahead and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
ear flap and we're going to go ahead and
just<00:01:51.000> flush<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.720> solution<00:01:52.409> down<00:01:52.619> there

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just flush a little solution down there

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.330 
just flush a little solution down there
and<00:01:53.299> then<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.720> ahead<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.229> massage<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and then we can go ahead and massage the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
and then we can go ahead and massage the
canal<00:01:56.640> gently<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.930> I'll<00:01:58.229> let<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.560> go

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
canal gently and then I'll let them go

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
canal gently and then I'll let them go
ahead<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> shake<00:01:59.490> their<00:01:59.700> head<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
ahead and shake their head and so it's a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.480 
ahead and shake their head and so it's a
good<00:02:01.439> idea<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.310> outside

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
good idea to maybe to do this outside

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.780 
good idea to maybe to do this outside
and<00:02:03.299> after<00:02:04.170> again<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> will<00:02:05.220> grab<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> cotton

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and after again I will grab a cotton

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.609 
and after again I will grab a cotton
ball<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> time<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.229> need<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ball and at this time I don't need to

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.109 
ball and at this time I don't need to
saturate<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.579> the<00:02:08.700> solutions

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
saturate it because all the solutions

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.179 
saturate it because all the solutions
here<00:02:09.419> I'm<00:02:09.749> just<00:02:10.049> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> clean<00:02:10.739> what's<00:02:11.009> up

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
here I'm just going to clean what's up

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.410 
here I'm just going to clean what's up
here<00:02:11.569> once<00:02:12.569> again<00:02:12.689> don't<00:02:13.590> use<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.769> q-tip

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
here once again don't use a q-tip

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660 
here once again don't use a q-tip
no<00:02:14.990> instruments<00:02:15.350> down<00:02:15.710> into<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.100> canal<00:02:16.400> and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
no instruments down into the canal and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.730 
no instruments down into the canal and
anytime<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.050> pretty<00:02:18.230> simple<00:02:18.470> and
