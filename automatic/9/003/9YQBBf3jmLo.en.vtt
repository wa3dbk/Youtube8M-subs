00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.940
 Speak beauty who says you are 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 max galera we are here with one more 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 video of the shining and this time of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 I'm going to show you guys here one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 area to talk about fire 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 It was a lot of people asking me to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 show where I usually make lumis and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 here guys on Mars in the mission area 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.559
 I'm going because I'm going to show 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 How do I do the procedure? 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.739
 usually I put on the level of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 light difficulty 22 is enough to 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.379
 to palm away more enemies is the ultra 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 updated with yellow hp and they 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.579
 usually give more fight then in the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 light difficulty 22 is enough 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 so let's start the galera phase 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.180
 You're going to get to this point here. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 very early and then we will activate 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.140
 here that item is are the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 refueling systems that make the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 cables generate more flares 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'll use it here if you do not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 use will also generate lumen 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.320
 less phantom population and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 wait for the cables to get there and that 's the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 galley is one of the best forms of fire 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 what I usually use and must be 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.520
 give faster results because beyond 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 volume generated by the work 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 usually they also exchange those 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.960
 items that you can later 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.509
 change lanuf touch for more for more 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 lumens so I'll keep talking about the weather 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.680
 here you only have to kill everyone who 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.350
 to appear here is certain is not to leave a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.719
 I live that people are going to kill themselves for 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 Then I can continue forming here. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.020
 understood 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.439
 You'll understand the logic well. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.439
 simple 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 those that yellow thp that he no longer has 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.970
 more money 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.240
 I'm playing here without using the sound I 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.310
 I'm not listening to the sound of the game. 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.950
 so you end up getting a bit without reference 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.290
 sometimes I get kind of bewildered that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.580
 You realize I do not know where to go. 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
 Look because I do not know where they're coming from. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.020
 the shots I just won my 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.020
 network key are those who 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.850
 later exchange there conquered that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.850
 will generate more than 200 volumes each 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.599
 beauty nor do we all the enemies here 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.400
 area 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:20.900
 I arrived here with two thousand men already 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.900
 we made 600 men 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.630
 the goal once again here to show 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.250
 you this process is being repeated 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.570
 as much as you want me 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 I also go because I'm going to go soon 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.790
 they will interrupt the recording and I will train 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.340
 until the maximum light that arrives is 25 thousand 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.770
 and I'll time how long it took 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.080
 to reach 25 thousand using this 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.200
 method here then boy to after 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.590
 an hour and five minutes forming me 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 I got here 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.700
 there are 22 thousand lumens 750 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.190
 I entered with 11 50 and a little code 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.050
 refill codes exit with 60 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.720
 totally correct enough of that there 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.870
 I'm with three network keys then 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.610
 Let's change our network key with 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.400
 total clip 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.400
 Let's go there 200 each 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:34.860
 just does not give more because the already hit the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:36.840
 amount of lumen already in the area was 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.760
 in 5 years 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.080
 the guy here 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.840
 another but the peeled I got in the fruit 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.750
 more than a month without any problems 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.050
 are the heavy environment appear here is 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.310
 because tomorrow the mind has to kill the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.250
 I'll do what, I'll do it myself. 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.520
 the mouth was not general is not that it is already 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.710
 I'm hoping to leave now. 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.750
 If you liked the video, do not 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.180
 forget to sign up for the chance channel 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.180
 tomorrow to install in until next to her
