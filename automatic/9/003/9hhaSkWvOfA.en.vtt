years 205 gld very very efficient but

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.400 
years 205 gld very very efficient but
yeah<00:00:48.220> quite<00:00:48.489> small<00:00:48.820> really<00:00:49.570> really<00:00:50.080> very

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
yeah quite small really really very

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.560 
yeah quite small really really very
small<00:00:50.559> I'd<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.550> window<00:00:51.940> winder<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.449> a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
small I'd have the window winder and a

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.780 
small I'd have the window winder and a
kind<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.199> certain<00:00:54.010> angle<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.550> would<00:00:54.670> always

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
kind of certain angle so it would always

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.150 
kind of certain angle so it would always
be<00:00:54.879> like<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.180> crack<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:56.110> window<00:00:56.440> atop<00:00:56.830> because

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
be like a crack of window atop because

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.380 
be like a crack of window atop because
that<00:00:57.519> was<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.699> only<00:00:57.729> way<00:00:57.970> yet<00:00:58.210> my<00:00:58.330> knee

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
that was the only way yet my knee

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.110 
that was the only way yet my knee
between<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.140> door<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.769> wheel<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.940> this

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
between the door and the wheel so this

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.200 
between the door and the wheel so this
whole<00:01:01.300> size<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.170> car<00:01:02.409> thing<00:01:02.710> has<00:01:02.920> been<00:01:03.100> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
whole size and car thing has been a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.050 
whole size and car thing has been a
running<00:01:04.210> trend<00:01:04.659> for<00:01:05.470> 20<00:01:05.979> years<00:01:06.250> I've<00:01:06.760> never

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
running trend for 20 years I've never

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.540 
running trend for 20 years I've never
gone<00:01:07.330> out<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.600> my<00:01:07.810> way<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.560> purchase<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.250> kind<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
gone out of my way to purchase a kind of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.210 
gone out of my way to purchase a kind of
life-changing<00:01:10.440> car<00:01:11.440> if<00:01:11.590> that<00:01:11.740> makes<00:01:11.950> sense

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
life-changing car if that makes sense

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.390 
life-changing car if that makes sense
I've<00:01:12.490> always<00:01:12.659> stayed<00:01:13.659> quite<00:01:14.049> sensibly<00:01:15.040> within

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
I've always stayed quite sensibly within

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
I've always stayed quite sensibly within
budget<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.000> it's<00:01:16.930> only<00:01:17.200> been<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.650> approach

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
budget and it's only been the approach

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.960 
budget and it's only been the approach
distant<00:01:19.990> approach<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.620> my<00:01:20.940> 40th<00:01:21.940> birthday

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
distant approach of my 40th birthday

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.630 
distant approach of my 40th birthday
that's<00:01:22.630> made<00:01:23.049> me<00:01:23.200> think<00:01:23.440> right<00:01:23.680> come<00:01:24.159> on<00:01:24.190> it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
that's made me think right come on it's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.820 
that's made me think right come on it's
time<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.080> think<00:01:26.170> about<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.470> serious

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
time to time to think about a serious

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.310 
time to time to think about a serious
car

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.040 

its<00:01:31.740> first<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.220> being<00:01:32.550> on<00:01:32.640> track<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.659> so

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
its first I know being on track and so

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.080 
its first I know being on track and so
first<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:34.620> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> track<00:01:35.010> in<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.310> couple<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
first I'm going to track in a couple of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.290 
first I'm going to track in a couple of
80<00:01:36.420> plus<00:01:37.080> thousand<00:01:37.740> pound<00:01:37.950> supercars<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
know your adrenaline pumping it was

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.320 
know your adrenaline pumping it was
great<00:01:42.750> being<00:01:42.900> in<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.380> combination<00:01:43.650> of

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
great being in that combination of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.390 
great being in that combination of
fantastic<00:01:45.330> car<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.200> instructor<00:01:46.650> it's

fantastic car and a good instructor it's

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.630 
fantastic car and a good instructor it's
so<00:01:47.670> difficult<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.390> road<00:01:49.229> driving<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.490> know

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so difficult the road driving you know

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
so difficult the road driving you know
all<00:01:51.030> those<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> different<00:01:51.900> skills<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
all those kind of different skills and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
all those kind of different skills and
and<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> love<00:01:53.280> learning<00:01:53.670> something<00:01:54.060> new<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and I love learning something new I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.300 
and I love learning something new I
definitely<00:01:55.050> got<00:01:55.440> better<00:01:55.470> during<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> day

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
definitely got better during the day

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.810 
definitely got better during the day
because<00:01:56.790> i<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.410> swap<00:01:58.800> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.160> cars<00:01:59.430> was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because i think the swap in the cars was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
because i think the swap in the cars was
the<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.300> way<00:02:00.509> round<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.560> I'd<00:02:01.740> gone<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the right way round if I'd gone from the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.560 
the right way round if I'd gone from the
Mercedes<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.830> Maserati<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:06.390> would

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Mercedes in to the Maserati it would

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
Mercedes in to the Maserati it would
have<00:02:06.690> been<00:02:06.840> tricky<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.250> have

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
have been tricky i think to have

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.449 
have been tricky i think to have
progressed<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.570> way<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> did<00:02:10.190> whereas<00:02:11.190> i

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
progressed of the way I did whereas i

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.370 
progressed of the way I did whereas i
was<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.239> learning<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.720> line<00:02:12.930> loaning

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
was kind of learning the line loaning

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900 
was kind of learning the line loaning
the<00:02:13.470> track<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.950> learning<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.310> technique<00:02:14.730> in

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the track and learning the technique in

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.760 
the track and learning the technique in
the<00:02:15.120> Maserati<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> got<00:02:16.530> into

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
the Maserati and then when I got into

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.500 
the Maserati and then when I got into
the<00:02:16.980> murk<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.459> like<00:02:17.610> okay<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the murk it was like okay this is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
the murk it was like okay this is
suddenly<00:02:18.810> got<00:02:18.959> easier<00:02:19.350> whereas<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> other

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
suddenly got easier whereas in the other

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.740 
suddenly got easier whereas in the other
way<00:02:20.550> around<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.330> would<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.540> got

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
way around I think it would have got

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.560 
way around I think it would have got
harder<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.700> wanted<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> Maserati<00:02:24.269> to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
harder actually I wanted the Maserati to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.110 
harder actually I wanted the Maserati to
be<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.170> perfect<00:02:25.980> because<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.700> looks<00:02:26.970> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
be to be perfect because it looks so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.410
