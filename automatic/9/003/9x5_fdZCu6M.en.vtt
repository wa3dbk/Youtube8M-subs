and this is a curling for it to be
really<00:02:54.650> really<00:02:54.890> curly<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.549> would<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.850> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
really really curly you would have to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.599 
really really curly you would have to
put<00:02:56.120> product<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:57.140> has<00:02:57.290> your<00:02:58.070> normal

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
put product in it just has your normal

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.300 
put product in it just has your normal
hair<00:02:58.930> gel<00:03:01.209> spritzer<00:03:02.209> what<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> wavy<00:03:03.739> whatever

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
hair gel spritzer what a wavy whatever

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.670 
hair gel spritzer what a wavy whatever
it<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.000> use<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:06.079> would<00:03:06.230> use<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.590> on

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
it is that you use you would use it on

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.509 
it is that you use you would use it on
this<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.310> does<00:03:07.640> curl<00:03:08.209> up<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.600> be<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:09.519> would

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
this and it does curl up to be I would

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.100 
this and it does curl up to be I would
say<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.940> really

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
say a really

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.040 
say a really
curly<00:03:12.860> loose<00:03:13.100> curl<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.540> would<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.840> my

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
curly loose curl that would be my

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.580 
curly loose curl that would be my
definition<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.710> it<00:03:16.090> okay<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.380> one

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
definition of it okay so this is the one

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.130 
definition of it okay so this is the one
beam<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> book<00:03:20.270> here<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
beam and this is the book here that I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.210 
beam and this is the book here that I
purchased<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.440> only<00:03:24.680> thing<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.980> didn't

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
purchased and the only thing I didn't

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.130 
purchased and the only thing I didn't
like<00:03:25.250> about<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.670> was<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.060> shedding<00:03:26.600> but

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
like about it was the shedding but

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.620 
like about it was the shedding but
that's<00:03:27.500> because<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.890> was<00:03:27.980> pop<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.520> course<00:03:28.850> you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
that's because it was pop of course you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.230 
that's because it was pop of course you
buy<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.930> already<00:03:30.890> tipped<00:03:31.250> or<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.610> weft<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.150> I

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
buy the already tipped or the weft and I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.490 
buy the already tipped or the weft and I
don't<00:03:32.450> think<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.080> problem<00:03:33.940> okay

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
don't think you have that problem okay

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.870 
don't think you have that problem okay
this<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.830> same<00:03:39.130> both<00:03:40.130> pieces<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.850> I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
this is the same both pieces that I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.570 
this is the same both pieces that I
purchased<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:42.200> actually<00:03:42.680> coordinate<00:03:43.370> this

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
purchased but I actually coordinate this

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.550 
purchased but I actually coordinate this
here<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.750> was<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:47.780> highlights<00:03:48.200> in

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
here I was going to like highlights in

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.770 
here I was going to like highlights in
these<00:03:48.890> extensions<00:03:49.520> but<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.240> I<00:03:50.270> change<00:03:50.600> my

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
these extensions but then I change my

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.210 
these extensions but then I change my
mind<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:52.100> is<00:03:52.310> like<00:03:52.550> what<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.510> really

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
mind so this is like what it is really

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.620 
mind so this is like what it is really
doesn't<00:03:55.220> have<00:03:55.310> any<00:03:55.460> product<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.330> this

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
doesn't have any product in it and this

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.610 
doesn't have any product in it and this
is<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:57.200> pretty<00:03:57.950> good<00:03:58.160> curl<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:59.440> this<00:04:00.440> is

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
is a pretty good curl and this is

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.260 
is a pretty good curl and this is
actually<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:02.320> golden<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.710> would<00:04:04.460> say<00:04:04.670> golden

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
actually a golden I would say golden

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.610 
actually a golden I would say golden
highlight

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620

number<00:04:09.250> level<00:04:10.120> seven<00:04:10.480> with<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> gold<00:04:11.230> toner<00:04:11.530> I

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
number level seven with a gold toner I

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.770 
number level seven with a gold toner I
did<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:14.980> what<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.250> comes<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.970> this

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
did so this is what it comes in and this

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.640 
did so this is what it comes in and this
is<00:04:16.840> what<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.350> already<00:04:18.150> colored<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:19.870> pretty

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
is what it already colored it's pretty

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.090
