bigoted wha

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:12.970 
bigoted wha
I<00:00:10.959> think<00:00:11.959> there<00:00:12.049> was<00:00:12.080> a<00:00:12.170> lot<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.350> limitations

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.529 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:13.100> our<00:00:13.219> old<00:00:13.430> collision<00:00:13.850> system<00:00:14.029> it<00:00:14.270> was<00:00:14.360> very

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.150 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:14.779> but<00:00:15.020> it<00:00:15.230> didn't<00:00:15.410> allow<00:00:15.559> us<00:00:15.709> to<00:00:15.799> do<00:00:15.949> some

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.220 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:16.609> were<00:00:17.090> quite<00:00:17.420> difficult<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.199> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.810 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:18.410> of<00:00:18.440> times<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.830> fifa<00:00:19.130> 11<00:00:19.220> you<00:00:19.580> get<00:00:19.789> a

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.640 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a
situation<00:00:20.480> where<00:00:20.630> maybe<00:00:20.779> two<00:00:21.109> players<00:00:21.410> are

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.820 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:21.980> into<00:00:22.519> one<00:00:22.999> another<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.830> because

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
running into one another and because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.829 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:25.519> a<00:00:25.609> lot<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:25.849> contacts<00:00:26.390> between<00:00:26.599> those

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.839 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:27.019> players<00:00:27.289> with<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.039> old<00:00:28.189> system<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:28.699> had

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.120 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:28.970> pick<00:00:29.150> one<00:00:29.390> contact<00:00:30.259> which<00:00:30.890> meant<00:00:31.099> that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.860 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:31.310> get<00:00:31.429> it<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:31.730> collision<00:00:32.270> animation<00:00:32.720> that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
we'd get it a collision animation that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.120 
we'd get it a collision animation that
did<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.050> great<00:00:33.260> job<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.530> showing<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.010> that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
did a great job of showing you that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.560 
did a great job of showing you that
there<00:00:34.310> was<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.460> collision<00:00:34.760> something<00:00:35.210> happened

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
there was a collision something happened

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.090 
there was a collision something happened
but<00:00:35.690> maybe<00:00:35.870> didn't<00:00:36.200> take<00:00:36.320> into<00:00:36.470> account<00:00:36.740> every

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
but maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.920 
but maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:37.310> detail<00:00:37.430> with<00:00:38.150> this<00:00:38.330> year's<00:00:38.570> engine

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.360 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:39.080> you<00:00:39.170> see<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.620> when<00:00:39.770> those<00:00:39.920> two<00:00:40.130> players

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.100 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:40.640> together<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.150> resolving<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.870> every

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.770 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:42.410> collision<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.890> happens<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.210> we're

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.440 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:45.410> able<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.890> preserve<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.400> momentum<00:00:46.940> a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.090 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:47.960> better<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.470> interactions<00:00:49.010> between

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.910 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:00:49.690> this<00:00:50.690> looks<00:00:50.960> fantastic<00:00:51.110> when<00:00:51.830> you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.860 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:00:52.070> into<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.340> replay<00:00:52.700> camera<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.600> see

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.650 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.550> limbs<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.850> parts<00:00:56.150> bending

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.210 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:00:56.780> contorting<00:00:57.260> as<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.530> would<00:00:57.680> expect<00:00:57.800> them

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.160 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:00:58.370> like<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.940> would<00:00:59.060> see<00:00:59.240> on<00:00:59.270> real-world<00:00:59.630> TV

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
to like you would see on real-world TV

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.500 
to like you would see on real-world TV
but<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.710> also<00:01:00.890> translates<00:01:01.400> into<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.030> telecom

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.749 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.440> really<00:01:03.710> feel<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.189> difference<00:01:04.549> of

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:05.890 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:04.939> game<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.390> really<00:01:05.659> feel<00:01:05.869> about

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
the game and you really feel about

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.800 
the game and you really feel about
preservation<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.740> momentum<00:01:07.390> another<00:01:08.390> benefit

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.779 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:08.960> get<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.499> we<00:01:10.159> resolve<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.579> lot<00:01:10.700> about

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
that we get is we resolve a lot about

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.330 
that we get is we resolve a lot about
clipping<00:01:11.390> issues<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:11.929> the<00:01:11.990> game<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.380> year<00:01:12.439> in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.859 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:13.880> year's<00:01:14.149> system<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:14.570> didn't<00:01:14.780> actually

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
last year's system we didn't actually

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.539 
last year's system we didn't actually
account<00:01:15.229> for<00:01:15.380> arm<00:01:15.619> collisions<00:01:16.039> at<00:01:16.130> all<00:01:16.310> and

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.849 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:16.850> couldn't<00:01:17.060> really<00:01:17.450> tell<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:18.049> in<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.770 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:19.280> but<00:01:19.460> if<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:19.609> wanted<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.939> replay<00:01:20.329> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.469 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:20.990> notice<00:01:21.409> that<00:01:22.219> arms<00:01:22.909> could<00:01:23.119> sometimes

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.819 
would notice that arms could sometimes
click<00:01:23.780> through<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.049> shoulder<00:01:24.499> or<00:01:24.530> click

well<00:01:27.079> this<00:01:27.200> year<00:01:27.350> we're<00:01:27.530> resolving<00:01:27.979> every

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
well this year we're resolving every

results are quite astounding one you
don't<00:01:34.520> actually<00:01:34.670> get<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:34.969> level<00:01:35.299> of<00:01:35.359> clipping

don't actually get the level of clipping
that<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.869> got<00:01:36.020> in<00:01:36.109> last<00:01:36.229> year's<00:01:36.469> game<00:01:36.619> but<00:01:36.799> to

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
that you got in last year's game but to

that you got in last year's game but to

shielding<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.609> get<00:01:44.020> more<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.109> a<00:01:45.170> tussle

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
shielding you get more of a tussle

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.840 
shielding you get more of a tussle
between<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.920> players<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.249> a<00:01:46.429> fight<00:01:46.639> for

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
between the players and a fight for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.099 
between the players and a fight for
possession<00:01:47.209> that<00:01:47.299> feels<00:01:47.569> more<00:01:47.810> realistic

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
possession that feels more realistic

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.569 
possession that feels more realistic
feels<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.770> things<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.069> you<00:01:49.189> might<00:01:49.310> see<00:01:49.549> on

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
feels like things that you might see on

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.300 
feels like things that you might see on
TV<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:51.350> illustrate<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.770> point<00:01:52.009> about<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
TV to illustrate the point about the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.649 
TV to illustrate the point about the
variety<00:01:52.459> we<00:01:52.939> get<00:01:53.149> I<00:01:53.270> want<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.509> talk<00:01:53.630> about

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.749 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:01:54.350> dribble<00:01:54.740> terms<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.159> what<00:01:55.639> this

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
contextual dribble terms and what this

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.179 
contextual dribble terms and what this
is<00:01:55.819> is<00:01:55.999> using<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.869> left<00:01:57.079> stick<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:58.009> could

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
is is using the left stick you could

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.830 
is is using the left stick you could
beat<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.369> player<00:01:58.639> last<00:01:58.880> year<00:01:59.060> by<00:01:59.270> maybe<00:01:59.479> taking

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
beat a player last year by maybe taking

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.340 
beat a player last year by maybe taking
just<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.109> 45-degree<00:02:00.770> dribble<00:02:01.069> term<00:02:01.249> but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
just a 45-degree dribble term but

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.359 
just a 45-degree dribble term but
sometimes<00:02:03.350> when<00:02:03.499> you<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.979> maybe<00:02:04.159> you'd

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.649 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd
knock<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.639> ball<00:02:04.789> by<00:02:04.999> him<00:02:05.029> and<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.420> player

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
knock the ball by him and that player

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.179 
knock the ball by him and that player
would<00:02:05.869> stick<00:02:06.079> out<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.229> leg<00:02:06.469> trying<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:06.979> tackle

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
would stick out a leg trying to tackle

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.070 
would stick out a leg trying to tackle

you're trying to go after the ball has
passed<00:02:10.490> him<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.569> when<00:02:11.689> you<00:02:11.780> add<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.110> year's

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379

he sticks out a leg to tackle and the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.540 
he sticks out a leg to tackle and the
dribbler<00:02:26.650> tries<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.980> jump<00:02:27.220> out<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.459> way

but<00:02:27.610> he<00:02:27.819> gets<00:02:28.000> caught<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.450> he<00:02:28.959> goes<00:02:29.110> down<00:02:29.350> but

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
but he gets caught and he goes down but

tackle and the way that his legs bend

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.160 
tackle and the way that his legs bend
because<00:02:33.790> he's<00:02:33.910> been<00:02:34.060> caught<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.630> creates

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
because he's been caught it creates

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.600 
because he's been caught it creates
another<00:02:35.440> level<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.830> variety<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.490> just

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
another level of variety that we just

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.150 
another level of variety that we just
wouldn't<00:02:36.820> have<00:02:36.970> had<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.270> game<00:02:37.480> last<00:02:37.690> year

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
wouldn't have had in the game last year

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.340 
wouldn't have had in the game last year
further<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.630> can<00:02:40.780> see<00:02:40.930> sup<00:02:41.170> now

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
further to that what you can see sup now

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.830 
further to that what you can see sup now
is<00:02:41.620> sometimes<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.190> dribbler<00:02:42.489> will<00:02:42.850> knock<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
is sometimes a dribbler will knock the

is sometimes a dribbler will knock the
ball<00:02:43.959> by<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> defender<00:02:44.500> using<00:02:44.890> one<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.040> these

gible<00:02:45.459> turns<00:02:45.640> jump<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> way<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.660> gets

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
gible turns jump out of the way and gets

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.840 
gible turns jump out of the way and gets
caught<00:02:47.110> but<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.709> slightly<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.489> he<00:02:48.580> takes<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
caught but just slightly so he takes a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.790 
caught but just slightly so he takes a
small<00:02:49.000> knock<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.660> what<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.200> get<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.560> little

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
small knock and what you get is a little

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.290 
small knock and what you get is a little
bit<00:02:50.920> more<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.190> resilience<00:02:51.820> from<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> player

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
bit more of resilience from the player

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.120 
bit more of resilience from the player
to<00:02:52.450> take<00:02:52.630> those<00:02:52.840> small<00:02:53.110> nuts<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.560> able<00:02:54.040> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
to take those small nuts and able to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.310 
to take those small nuts and able to
continue<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.120> after<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> ball<00:02:55.720> now

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
continue on and go after the ball now

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.080 
continue on and go after the ball now
players<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.890> Messi<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.459> skip<00:02:57.880> through

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
players like Messi can skip through

those challenge take a knock bounce off
of<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.160> tackle<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.640> still<00:03:00.940> continue<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.540> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of a tackle and still continue on to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.720 
of a tackle and still continue on to
really<00:03:02.260> pursue<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> ball<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.040> continue<00:03:03.610> the

flow of the game and it makes for a much
