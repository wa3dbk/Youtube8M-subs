00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.620 
or don't know which ones I'm talking
about<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:11.549> usually<00:01:12.549> don't<00:01:12.729> use<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.210> watercolor

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
about I usually don't use the watercolor

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.990 
about I usually don't use the watercolor
effect<00:01:13.720> with<00:01:14.229> them<00:01:14.500> because<00:01:14.770> I'm<00:01:15.310> just<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.729> fan

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
effect with them because I'm just a fan

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.499 
effect with them because I'm just a fan
of<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.270> color<00:01:16.479> pencil<00:01:16.840> itself<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.150> decided

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
of the color pencil itself but I decided

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.179 
of the color pencil itself but I decided
to<00:01:19.810> use<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.049> for<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.320> drawing<00:01:20.619> and<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.070> when

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
to use it for this drawing and so when

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.890 
to use it for this drawing and so when
you<00:01:21.280> see<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.579> water<00:01:21.759> brush<00:01:22.000> that's<00:01:22.420> what<00:01:22.780> I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.859 
you see the water brush that's what I'm
doing<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.439> used<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.369> for<00:01:24.400> creating<00:01:25.329> base<00:01:25.540> color

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
doing I used it for creating base color

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.929 
doing I used it for creating base color
before<00:01:26.079> adding<00:01:26.470> any<00:01:26.590> details<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.729> also

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.969 
fingers the tools you use to apply them
I<00:05:46.000> call<00:05:46.210> soft<00:05:46.539> tools<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.139> they're<00:05:47.620> kind<00:05:47.919> of

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
I call soft tools and they're kind of

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.770 
I call soft tools and they're kind of
like<00:05:48.130> makeup<00:05:48.460> sponges<00:05:48.849> so<00:05:49.030> I<00:05:49.060> guess<00:05:49.300> you<00:05:49.479> could

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
like makeup sponges so I guess you could

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.110 
like makeup sponges so I guess you could
actually<00:05:50.500> technically<00:05:51.070> use<00:05:51.430> some<00:05:51.759> makeup

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
actually technically use some makeup

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.830 
actually technically use some makeup
sponges<00:05:52.509> for<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:53.940> from<00:05:54.940> what<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.240> read<00:05:55.539> there

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
sponges for it from what I read there

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.080 
sponges for it from what I read there
were<00:05:56.020> originally<00:05:56.830> 80<00:05:57.099> cars<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:57.760> then<00:05:57.940> they

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
were originally 80 cars and then they

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.150 
were originally 80 cars and then they
came<00:05:58.330> out<00:05:58.570> with<00:05:58.630> six<00:05:59.289> additional<00:05:59.800> shades

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
came out with six additional shades

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.300 
came out with six additional shades
which<00:06:00.789> were<00:06:01.000> all<00:06:01.240> metallic<00:06:01.930> you<00:06:02.860> can<00:06:03.010> use<00:06:03.160> the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
which were all metallic you can use the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.460 
which were all metallic you can use the
soft<00:06:03.580> tools<00:06:03.849> to<00:06:04.060> mix<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.479> cause<00:06:04.690> in<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.199> pen

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
soft tools to mix the cause in the pen

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.939 
soft tools to mix the cause in the pen
so<00:06:05.949> you<00:06:05.979> can<00:06:06.280> dip<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:07.030> sponges<00:06:07.570> or<00:06:07.900> pick<00:06:08.830> up

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
so you can dip the sponges or pick up

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.100 
so you can dip the sponges or pick up
some<00:06:09.159> color<00:06:09.400> off<00:06:09.729> maybe<00:06:10.150> like<00:06:10.389> a<00:06:10.419> blue<00:06:10.690> and

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
some color off maybe like a blue and

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.439 
some color off maybe like a blue and
then<00:06:11.349> go<00:06:11.949> into<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.400> yellow<00:06:12.580> pen<00:06:12.970> and<00:06:13.180> pick<00:06:13.330> up

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
then go into the yellow pen and pick up

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.980 
then go into the yellow pen and pick up
some<00:06:13.630> yellow<00:06:13.810> to<00:06:14.199> make<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.380> green<00:06:15.870> there<00:06:16.870> are

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
some yellow to make a green there are

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.899 
some yellow to make a green there are
not<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.320> most<00:06:17.530> inexpensive<00:06:18.039> product<00:06:18.610> but

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
not the most inexpensive product but

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.790 
not the most inexpensive product but
from<00:06:19.449> what<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:19.659> could<00:06:19.750> see<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.260> don't<00:06:20.440> really

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
from what I could see you don't really

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.430 
from what I could see you don't really
save<00:06:21.070> much<00:06:21.340> by<00:06:21.580> buying<00:06:21.820> this<00:06:22.030> sets<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.630> if

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
save much by buying this sets and if

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.469 
save much by buying this sets and if
that's<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.830> case<00:06:23.919> in<00:06:24.430> stores<00:06:24.789> near<00:06:25.030> you<00:06:25.060> you

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
that's the case in stores near you you

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.420 
that's the case in stores near you you
could<00:06:25.630> really<00:06:25.900> just<00:06:26.169> start<00:06:26.590> out<00:06:26.710> by<00:06:26.919> getting<00:06:26.979> a

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
could really just start out by getting a

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.430 
could really just start out by getting a
couple<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.789> colors<00:06:28.030> just<00:06:28.659> ones<00:06:28.930> that<00:06:29.139> you<00:06:29.260> know

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
couple of colors just ones that you know

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.379 
couple of colors just ones that you know
you're<00:06:29.710> gonna<00:06:29.919> use<00:06:30.220> right<00:06:30.490> away<00:06:30.639> or<00:06:31.090> colors

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
you're gonna use right away or colors

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.029 
you're gonna use right away or colors
you<00:06:31.570> knew<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:32.020> were<00:06:32.080> gonna<00:06:32.289> use<00:06:32.530> a<00:06:32.560> lot<00:06:32.860> and

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
you knew you were gonna use a lot and

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.980 
you knew you were gonna use a lot and
then<00:06:33.550> build<00:06:33.760> up<00:06:33.849> your<00:06:34.000> collection<00:06:34.180> along<00:06:34.840> the

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
then build up your collection along the

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.790 
then build up your collection along the
way<00:06:36.510> my<00:06:37.510> only<00:06:37.780> complaint<00:06:38.080> is<00:06:38.289> to<00:06:38.440> watch<00:06:38.620> the

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
way my only complaint is to watch the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.920 
way my only complaint is to watch the
packaging<00:06:39.340> and<00:06:39.610> that<00:06:40.180> is<00:06:40.360> when<00:06:40.570> you<00:06:40.690> buy<00:06:40.870> the

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
packaging and that is when you buy the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.960 
packaging and that is when you buy the
sets<00:06:41.530> like<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:41.860> bought<00:06:42.190> this<00:06:42.370> five<00:06:42.610> piece<00:06:42.909> set

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970
