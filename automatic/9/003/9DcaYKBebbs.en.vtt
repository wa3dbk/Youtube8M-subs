to<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:19.049> I'd<00:01:19.560> say<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.549> probably<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.090> second

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to do I'd say it was probably my second

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.080 
to do I'd say it was probably my second
year<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> speed<00:01:22.080> skating<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:23.280> goal<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.850> year

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
year of speed skating my goal that year

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
speed skating and that's I decided that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
speed skating and that's I decided that
if<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.460> make<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> level<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
if I can make it to that level then I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
if I can make it to that level then I
would<00:01:31.710> continue<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> pursue<00:01:32.909> speed

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
would continue on and pursue speed

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990 
would continue on and pursue speed
skating<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.500> ended<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.860> making<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.460> junior

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.969

her through some pretty big trials I got
cut<00:03:09.110> boat<00:03:09.380> here<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.860> then<00:03:09.950> went<00:03:10.190> up<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.310> about

had to cut a bit more just to try to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.080 
had to cut a bit more just to try to
grab<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.990> tendons<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.800> pull<00:03:15.980> them<00:03:16.160> down<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
grab the tendons to pull them down the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.120 
grab the tendons to pull them down the
scar<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:17.450> her<00:03:17.810> arm<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> reminder<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.920> an

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
scar on her arm is a reminder of an

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.390 
scar on her arm is a reminder of an
accident<00:03:19.640> nearly<00:03:19.910> three<00:03:20.420> years<00:03:20.450> ago<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:22.160> was

doing what's called an Excel and so we

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.300 
doing what's called an Excel and so we
start<00:03:26.480> off<00:03:26.660> slowly<00:03:26.989> down<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:27.620> stretch<00:03:27.980> and

start off slowly down this stretch and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.520 
start off slowly down this stretch and
we<00:03:28.459> go<00:03:28.580> faster<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.150> faster<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.989> once<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.410> hit

we go faster and faster and once we hit

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.920 
we go faster and faster and once we hit
the<00:03:30.680> corner<00:03:31.160> we're<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:31.489> top<00:03:31.730> speed<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.750> went

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
the corner we're at top speed and I went

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.979 
the corner we're at top speed and I went
around<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.230> corner<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.270> somehow<00:03:35.270> i<00:03:35.450> lost<00:03:35.600> my

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
around the corner and somehow i lost my

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.110 
around the corner and somehow i lost my
balance<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.680> crashed<00:03:37.070> into<00:03:37.370> another<00:03:37.520> skater

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
balance and crashed into another skater

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.729 
balance and crashed into another skater
that<00:03:38.360> was<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.660> gliding<00:03:39.050> around<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.380> outside

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
that was just gliding around the outside

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.720 
that was just gliding around the outside
and<00:03:39.980> her<00:03:40.970> skate<00:03:41.360> cut<00:03:41.810> my<00:03:41.989> arm<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:43.160> timing

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
and her skate cut my arm and the timing

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.699 
and her skate cut my arm and the timing
couldn't<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:44.239> been<00:03:44.360> worse<00:03:44.540> kind<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.620> was

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
couldn't have been worse kind it was

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.100 
couldn't have been worse kind it was
about<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.370> week<00:03:46.580> before<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:47.600> are<00:03:47.690> heading<00:03:47.989> off

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
about a week before we are heading off

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.460 
about a week before we are heading off
to<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> fall<00:03:49.010> World<00:03:49.250> Cups<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:51.050> thought

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
to the fall World Cups and so I thought

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.810 
to the fall World Cups and so I thought
I<00:03:51.530> was<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:51.920> go<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.220> hospital<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
I was going to go to the hospital and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.850 
I was going to go to the hospital and
get<00:03:52.910> stitched<00:03:53.270> up<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.570> I'd<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:54.020> fine<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.650> I

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
get stitched up and I'd be fine but I

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.250 
get stitched up and I'd be fine but I
ended<00:03:55.280> up<00:03:55.400> getting<00:03:55.640> 12<00:03:56.270> tendons<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.140> nerves

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
ended up getting 12 tendons and nerves

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.800 
ended up getting 12 tendons and nerves
an<00:03:57.770> artery<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.120> was<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.300> lot<00:03:59.570> worse<00:03:59.600> than

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
an artery and so it was a lot worse than

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.580 
an artery and so it was a lot worse than
I<00:04:00.350> had<00:04:00.470> expected<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.540> they<00:04:02.540> basically<00:04:03.140> told

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
I had expected and they basically told

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.830 
I had expected and they basically told
me<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:03.920> my<00:04:04.040> season<00:04:04.459> was<00:04:04.489> probably<00:04:04.940> done<00:04:05.239> but

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.900 
me that my season was probably done but
looking<00:04:06.170> back<00:04:06.200> she<00:04:06.680> says<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.280> was<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.459> best

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
looking back she says it was the best

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.510

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.440 
gold right now is just to make it to
2010<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.280> think<00:05:22.729> it's<00:05:22.820> going<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.060> be<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.270> lot

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
2010 and I think it's going to be a lot

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.960 
2010 and I think it's going to be a lot
of<00:05:23.510> fun<00:05:23.860> so<00:05:24.860> how<00:05:25.010> does<00:05:25.070> she<00:05:25.310> handle<00:05:25.520> all<00:05:25.820> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
of fun so how does she handle all the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.480 
of fun so how does she handle all the
pressure<00:05:26.500> staying<00:05:27.500> close<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.919> ice<00:05:28.160> and

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
pressure staying close to the ice and

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.379 
pressure staying close to the ice and
God<00:05:29.620> Steve<00:05:30.620> bells<00:05:30.919> my<00:05:31.220> favorite<00:05:31.610> artist<00:05:32.060> and

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
God Steve bells my favorite artist and

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.180 
God Steve bells my favorite artist and
so<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.930> listened<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.560> some<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.800> his<00:05:33.919> music

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
so I listened to some of his music

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.219 
so I listened to some of his music
sometimes<00:05:34.880> before<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.300> race<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:35.870> there's<00:05:36.020> one

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
sometimes before I race and there's one

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.890 
sometimes before I race and there's one
song<00:05:36.919> that<00:05:36.950> has<00:05:37.700> really<00:05:37.970> encouraged<00:05:38.479> me<00:05:38.479> it's

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
song that has really encouraged me it's

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.070 
song that has really encouraged me it's
called<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.560> will<00:05:39.800> not<00:05:39.950> be<00:05:40.130> shaken<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:41.080> it's

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
called I will not be shaken and it's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.640 
called I will not be shaken and it's
from<00:05:42.320> Psalm<00:05:42.800> 16<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:44.660> really<00:05:45.139> helps<00:05:45.560> me

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
from Psalm 16 and it really helps me

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.650 
from Psalm 16 and it really helps me
because<00:05:46.010> there's<00:05:46.280> one<00:05:46.520> verse<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:47.030> he<00:05:47.120> sings

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
because there's one verse that he sings

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.360 
because there's one verse that he sings
over<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.110> over<00:05:48.169> again<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.560> says<00:05:48.919> I<00:05:49.070> will<00:05:49.130> not

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
over and over again and says I will not

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.110 
over and over again and says I will not
be<00:05:49.520> shaken<00:05:49.729> and<00:05:50.289> I<00:05:51.460> just<00:05:52.460> feel<00:05:52.729> like<00:05:52.760> it

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
be shaken and I just feel like it

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.839 
be shaken and I just feel like it
doesn't<00:05:53.419> matter<00:05:53.599> how<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.440> do<00:05:54.650> it<00:05:54.889> at<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.610> games
