00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.550
 with our new series back report 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.470
 We also want the many small ones though 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.240
 especially the big problems 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.610
 point out in battlefield 4 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.040
 this time we focus on the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.720
 label copter you may well with fug 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.790
 and rightly claim that it is the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.920
 Teddies around by far the most 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.140
 annoyed vehicle class if you with them 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.090
 battlefield 3 compares the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.440
 many problems you even ask 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.030
 still from the beginning days of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 Battlefield 3 knew 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.059
 in battlefield 4 a renaissance 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.309
 learn or ask yourself already 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.019
 sometimes quite seriously whether here the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.390
 Developer from Battlefield 3 at all 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.519
 still have learned or a completely 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.650
 another team the game also develops 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.470
 There are quite a few new bugs 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.360
 sometimes even more serious 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.489
 have some influence as some of the bugs 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.470
 men from battlefield 3 knows which 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.690
 that is what we are showing in detail and now 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.210
 Based on the many examples we for 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.400
 researched this video first 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.159
 to call the so-called that too 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 we are dealing with zones in 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.030
 the tvs always only dust hits 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 on the opponent here the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.670
 cause these zones corresponding 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.580
 so-called red zones so just these 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.770
 that of none of the infantrymen of both 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.900
 teams can be entered without 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.380
 ten seconds automatically to life 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300
 to lose 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.710
 we show that I'm getting out of here 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.030
 Seeing the helicopter one sees oneself 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.100
 I'm still in the for the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 Distribution walk-in zone and the TV 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.260
 causes damage to me i care 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.730
 then later in the rotation what 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.680
 then again demonstrate that to me 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.500
 briefly get out of the cockpit and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 as a result the tv happens to happen 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.550
 absolutely nothing in principle 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 this works on all battlefields 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.880
 four maps and is how you look 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.650
 Imagine a serious one 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 problem if you have a helikos 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.400
 exploit this bug then they are when 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.229
 They distance themselves all the time 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.259
 keep virtually invulnerable 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.840
 This bug must be fixed urgently 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 the same invulnerability to tv 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 Incidentally, missiles also hit boats 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 if you look here he goes with the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.939
 boot briefly into the version pure 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.799
 receives no harm then again 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.689
 in the sales key for the bar 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.450
 he gets hurt in the area 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.659
 the tvr kÃ¤the the next point concerns 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.220
 especially the hosting of roccat 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.500
 Close distance you can see the post 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.909
 downright by the target-passing 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.560
 So it looks like it's flying 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.129
 The hit boxes are about the size of one 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.769
 walnut 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.720
 you have a tiny little point in the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.790
 Hedi still hit the mark 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.019
 to achieve 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.609
 Also here should be the hit box 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.549
 either be significantly increased or 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.139
 the registration on this box clearly 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.000
 be improved around this 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.150
 serious problem in the handle too 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.150
 to get 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.200
 By the way, even TV rockets can 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.900
 Boats if you are on short distance 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.450
 shoot each other through each one 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.910
 enemy messengers fly through as well 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.140
 very interesting 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.690
 Let's get to the next point 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.300
 so called ghosting as the name already 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.550
 says the tv rocket flies here almost like 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
 a ghost without contact through the 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.790
 aim by causing no 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.320
 hurt and occurs on the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.510
 just opposite again 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.270
 from this bug you already know 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.160
 Battlefield 3 and hopefully he will be in 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.160
 near future finally fixed 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.200
 Of course , the tv rocket can not 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.430
 just fly through the target 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.950
 but she can just do it 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.720
 flake off the so-called the thing 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.010
 So only dust hits generated 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.019
 are you also aware of 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.860
 Battlefield 3 and stay here too 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.510
 just to be 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.959
 hopefully this problem will also be 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.959
 Fixed 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.280
 Not only the TV rocket can be on target 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.110
 flake off that also applies to the 30 mm 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.090
 how here in the example looks a 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.209
 full magazine on it and not a single one 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.390
 hit brand there are countless others 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.490
 tv box here just a little curious 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.160
 for example, when the tv rocket from the target 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.270
 from wide and 90 degrees angle reflected 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.400
 will be very pretty sometimes pulling the hit 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.550
 boxing far behind and then 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.950
 you get with marca and hit the hedi 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.200
 although you shoot far over here 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.970
 you can see some examples especially 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.980
 emphasize that this behavior is mostly 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.780
 is quite inconsistent and that it is 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.780
 temporarily accumulated 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.500
 a classic from battlefield 3 is the 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.960
 tv team kindberg explodes the tv 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.020
 perpetrators in their own cell phone if you take them off 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.580
 shoots and offenders with possibly not 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.090
 only himself, of course, his own 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.830
 pilots 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.919
 since the tv rocket in battlefield 4 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.300
 currently only 80 damage would be caused 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.340
 they only lead to a team care 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.870
 and already slightly damaged 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.240
 Remember Battlefield 3 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.370
 back so this bug actually became 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.139
 only fixed at the very last update 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.520
 it remains to be hoped that it will be in battlefield 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.000
 goes much faster 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.729
 new is the behavior of the tvb near 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.130
 explosions the camera of the rocket itself 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.740
 to wobble that goes for explosion 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.600
 the names of the rocket itself or names 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.880
 helicopters are the conclusion point 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.430
 this far is relatively meaningless and 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.289
 we hope that it also turned off 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.300
 becomes 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.820
 Interestingly, the person of the tv 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.669
 protect now completely identical to the tv 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.990
 rocket yourself so that at ctv councils 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.479
 The shooter himself is also decided 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.639
 could suffer damage based it is a 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.590
 Lightweight protect from the cockpit 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.810
 to shoot out though he is pure 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.320
 physical located in a different location 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.210
 would have interesting a tv rocket the 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.889
 slightly outside the maximum 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.409
 Range of 1000 meters shot down 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.260
 becomes and your goal meets loses 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.970
 about 1000 meters her owner 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.250
 still causes damage to the target 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.260
 However, the TV Sagittarius does not get any 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.360
 more points also something 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.020
 abstruse behave urgently one 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.020
 correction needed 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.680
 surf with this short video 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.860
 to have given sufficient feedback around 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.570
 at least the biggest bugs and problems 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.740
 put battlefield 4 and the teddies 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.380
 to have shown 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.540
 especially the depth of the son and that 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.980
 ghosting are serious problems 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.600
 that get under control 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.730
 have to be around this game 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.620
 to make actually playable 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.960
 In essence, the impression is imminent 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.270
 on that from their mistakes 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.520
 Battlefield 3 only insufficient lessons 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.050
 Nevertheless, we are fuller 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.240
 hope that the game in the 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.160
 next month to the positive 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.050
 At least it is going to be developing here 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.290
 hope a very big role 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.550
 if you know more bugs or 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.620
 have other suggestions for this video 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.710
 then leave a comment we 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.210
 like to thank you as always 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.650
 ever turn us on for it if it does 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.510
 We liked it and we drink here too 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.520
 to our last quicktipp by us 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.740
 talk about the author or park as well 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.100
 also absolutely great black rain 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.100
 ends
