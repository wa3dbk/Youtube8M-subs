00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello we are going to set it up now 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.620
 valve for fifty dollars we need to do this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.500
 there will be a key for nine two probes 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.650
 and some flat teeth but I will 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.010
 these are better 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 So 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:28.950
 put on a dead center here you are 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.950
 I have to make a dough 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 18 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.630
 here's a little letter you have it together with this 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 garbage combine here it is just like that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:57.020
 we bring and all the letter t was opposite 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:01.970
 This thing is another feature of this 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:06.309
 the main thing we have to be everywhere is big 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.309
 a hole in the middle two small at the edges 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.130
 ok, let's start spinning 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.570
 already 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:32.210
 This probes we need five hundredths and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:37.540
 one tenth is for prom one 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:42.110
 the tenth and five hundredths are for the inlet 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.759
 then the inlet is the top of the exhaust bottom 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.259
 it means here five hundredths here one tenth 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:54.310
 nut nut weaken it weakened 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:02:00.170
 We put the probe between the spring 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:05.929
 between themselves and just lightly fingers 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.540
 we tighten so that are clamped slightly 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:23.450
 unscrewed here pike began to walk 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:25.130
 then we take the key on 9 we put so 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.810
 this keratin must be kept let her 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 go spinning this one it means 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:38.530
 pliers capture and twist 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.840
 i.e 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.540
 spin as much as possible 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.540
 here we will put a small move 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:30.830
 I 'll pull the second cheek then 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.630
 walk freely but not so much in general 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.690
 Cho put there and he should not yet 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 go to work still catch up with us 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:49.270
 will start walking an hour 1 bundle tara now 2 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.270
 too far here too 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.910
 it means we spin the same way 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.390
 insert the probe check twisted set 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.620
 head off 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.620
