we're going to be doing is I'm gonna be
adding

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700 

I'll<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.460> adding<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:21.020> sesame<00:01:22.020> oil<00:01:22.290> now<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I'll be adding up sesame oil now the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
I'll be adding up sesame oil now the
shiitake<00:01:23.280> mushroom<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:24.150> though<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
shiitake mushroom even though it is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
shiitake mushroom even though it is
soaked<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.229> water<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.860> liquid<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> lot

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
soaked in water they like liquid a lot

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.640 
soaked in water they like liquid a lot
so<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.060> keep<00:01:30.299> putting<00:01:30.570> oils<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.500> you're

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so if you keep putting oils when you're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
so if you keep putting oils when you're
frying<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.460> end<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.820> using<00:01:32.970> too<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.329> oil

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
frying it you end up using too much oil

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
frying it you end up using too much oil
so<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> usually<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> shiitake

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so what I usually do what is shiitake

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
so what I usually do what is shiitake
mushroom<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.720> marinate<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.710> first<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
mushroom is to marinate it first and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
mushroom is to marinate it first and
then<00:01:38.759> frying<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> small<00:01:39.930> frying<00:01:40.200> pan

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
then frying it on a small frying pan

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.130 
then frying it on a small frying pan
that<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.390> gonna<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.049> about

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

tablespoonful<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.400> know<00:01:55.550> what<00:01:55.790> you
