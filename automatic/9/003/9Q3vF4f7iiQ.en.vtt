00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.959 

twenty-seven<00:00:09.639> unit<00:00:10.120> aid<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.950> there's<00:00:12.190> two

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
twenty-seven unit aid so there's two

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.770 
twenty-seven unit aid so there's two
principles<00:00:13.509> here

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.360 

you

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.370 
you

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.290 
you
one<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.240> Ohm's<00:00:19.600> law<00:00:19.780> and<00:00:20.200> what<00:00:20.860> is<00:00:20.980> Ohm's<00:00:21.190> law

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
one is Ohm's law and what is Ohm's law

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.210 
one is Ohm's law and what is Ohm's law
you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.770 

what<00:00:27.939> is<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.179> equation<00:00:28.630> for<00:00:28.660> Ohm's<00:00:28.929> law

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.209 

you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.139 

that's<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:40.430> would<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:41.940> say

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that's right and I would have to say

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
that's right and I would have to say
Ohm's<00:00:42.690> law<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.289> one<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> equations<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
Ohm's law is one of the equations that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.079 
Ohm's law is one of the equations that
come<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.879> relatively<00:00:45.839> frequently<00:00:46.969> with<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
come up relatively frequently with the

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.610 
come up relatively frequently with the
GAM<00:00:48.269> set<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
GAM set but just because you know the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.899 
GAM set but just because you know the
equation<00:00:50.100> doesn't<00:00:50.399> mean<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.699> get

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
equation doesn't mean you're gonna get

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.990 
equation doesn't mean you're gonna get
the<00:00:51.059> answer<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.659> it<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the answer right it just it just is the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.160 
the answer right it just it just is the
foundation<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:56.070> proceed<00:00:56.909> let's<00:00:57.839> put<00:00:58.049> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
foundation to to proceed let's put it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.270 
foundation to to proceed let's put it
that<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.570> yeah<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:02.040> first

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that way and so yeah the first the first

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.170 
that way and so yeah the first the first
issue<00:01:02.519> here<00:01:02.909> okay<00:01:03.839> so<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.350> batteries<00:01:05.180> at

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
issue here okay so you see batteries at

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.719 
issue here okay so you see batteries at
the<00:01:06.299> top<00:01:06.509> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.380> three<00:01:07.890> diagrams<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the top of the these three diagrams and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.370 
the top of the these three diagrams and
you<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:11.729> symbol<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.360> globe<00:01:12.720> which

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you see the symbol for a globe which

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.600 
you see the symbol for a globe which
means<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.240> light<00:01:15.240> bulb<00:01:15.539> so<00:01:15.929> you<00:01:16.649> see<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.340> symbol

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
means a light bulb so you see the symbol

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
means a light bulb so you see the symbol
for<00:01:17.729> light<00:01:17.970> bulb<00:01:18.179> a<00:01:18.360> light<00:01:18.869> bulb<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.319> a<00:01:19.409> circuit

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
for light bulb a light bulb in a circuit

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.120 
for light bulb a light bulb in a circuit
is<00:01:20.039> it<00:01:20.580> behaves<00:01:20.970> exactly<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.899> resistor<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
is it behaves exactly like a resistor so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
is it behaves exactly like a resistor so
and<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> symbols<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.740> resistors<00:01:26.600> include

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and the symbols for resistors include

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.309 
and the symbols for resistors include
these<00:01:28.500> rectangles<00:01:29.429> which<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.000> tried<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:31.020> draw

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
these rectangles which I tried to draw

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.770 
these rectangles which I tried to draw
which<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.369> always<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.030> drawn<00:01:33.270> better<00:01:33.539> than

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
which will always be drawn better than

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.789 
which will always be drawn better than
what<00:01:33.929> I<00:01:33.960> did<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:36.090> other<00:01:36.289> symbol<00:01:37.289> for

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
what I did and the other symbol for

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
what I did and the other symbol for
resistors<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.240> old-fashioned

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
resistors is the more old-fashioned

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.609 
resistors is the more old-fashioned
symbol<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.940> squiggly<00:01:42.270> line<00:01:42.660> but

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
symbol which is the squiggly line but

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.279 
symbol which is the squiggly line but
it's<00:01:43.770> still<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.069> popular<00:01:44.640> thing<00:01:44.910> so<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.360> resistor

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
it's still a popular thing so a resistor

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's still a popular thing so a resistor
can<00:01:46.440> be<00:01:46.679> a<00:01:46.890> bulb<00:01:47.580> which<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.629> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
can be a bulb which you see in the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.760 
can be a bulb which you see in the
diagram<00:01:48.929> or<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.190> could<00:01:50.429> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:51.000> resistor<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:51.989> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
diagram or it could be a resistor or it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.130 
diagram or it could be a resistor or it
could<00:01:53.039> be<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.239> could<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> drawn<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.080> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
could be or it could be drawn as a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.889 
could be or it could be drawn as a
resistor<00:01:55.830> or<00:01:56.220> drawn<00:01:56.819> as<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> rect

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
resistor or drawn as a rect

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.389 
resistor or drawn as a rect
rectangle<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.580> resistance<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.629> no

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
rectangle which is a resistance and no

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.369 
rectangle which is a resistance and no
lightbulbs<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.550> not<00:02:02.910> resistance<00:02:03.690> less

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:04.379 
lightbulbs are not resistance less

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.759 
lightbulbs are not resistance less
they're<00:02:05.190> exactly<00:02:06.179> filled<00:02:06.929> with<00:02:07.080> resistance

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
they're exactly filled with resistance

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.369 
they're exactly filled with resistance
and<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.310> why<00:02:08.700> energy<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.509> dissipated<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and that's why energy is dissipated and

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.490 
and that's why energy is dissipated and
we<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:12.090> result<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> power<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we see the result which is the power of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
we see the result which is the power of
the<00:02:13.830> lightbulb<00:02:14.340> which<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.660> current

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the lightbulb which is the current

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.390 
the lightbulb which is the current
moving<00:02:16.920> through<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.730> resistor<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.010> now<00:02:20.010> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
moving through the resistor so now so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.670 
moving through the resistor so now so
when<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.849> look<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.180> these<00:02:21.360> these<00:02:22.349> three

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
when we look at these these three

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920 
when we look at these these three
circuits<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:24.090> already<00:02:24.450> been<00:02:24.629> said

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
circuits it's already been said

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.040 
circuits it's already been said
correctly<00:02:25.410> about<00:02:26.150> if<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.360> happen<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.780> know

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
correctly about if you happen to know

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.350 
correctly about if you happen to know
that<00:02:28.080> parallel<00:02:28.680> circuits<00:02:29.099> produce<00:02:29.940> less

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
that parallel circuits produce less

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.920 
that parallel circuits produce less
resistance<00:02:30.959> then<00:02:31.379> then<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.970> are<00:02:33.599> going

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
resistance then then you just are going

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.430 
resistance then then you just are going
to<00:02:34.110> use<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.310> following<00:02:35.700> logic<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.290> have

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
to use the following logic that we have

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.589 
to use the following logic that we have
a<00:02:37.470> voltage<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.489> voltage<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:39.000> constant<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
a voltage the voltage is constant the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.180 
a voltage the voltage is constant the
voltage<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.019> coming<00:02:40.230> from<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> battery<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
voltage is coming from the battery the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.390 
voltage is coming from the battery the
battery<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> same<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:43.950> current

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
battery is the same then we have current

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
battery is the same then we have current
and<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.300> resistance<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.440> wherever

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and then we have resistance so wherever

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.410 
and then we have resistance so wherever
you<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.300> lowest

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you have the lowest

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.390 
you have the lowest
resistance<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.740> will<00:02:50.770> have<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.160> highest

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
resistance you will have the highest

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.760 
resistance you will have the highest
current<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> voltage<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.290> constant

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
current because the voltage is constant

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.640 
current because the voltage is constant
so<00:02:54.220> lowest<00:02:54.760> resistance<00:02:55.300> high<00:02:55.690> skirt<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.590> have

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
so lowest resistance high skirt you have

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.400 
so lowest resistance high skirt you have
the<00:02:56.800> highest<00:02:56.980> current<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:59.290> you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the highest current then you have if you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.680 
the highest current then you have if you
have<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.740> current<00:03:00.430> running<00:03:01.240> through<00:03:01.569> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
have more current running through the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.840 
have more current running through the
bulb<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.230> bug<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.770> brighter<00:03:03.160> that's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
bulb the bug will be brighter that's

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.870 
bulb the bug will be brighter that's
that's<00:03:04.480> why<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.650> know<00:03:05.800> current<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.490> also

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
that's why you know current is also

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.410 
that's why you know current is also
related<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.360> power<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.520> power<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.120> equal

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
related to power which is power is equal

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.420 
related to power which is power is equal
to<00:03:10.510> ie<00:03:10.720> power<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.470> current<00:03:11.830> on<00:03:11.980> voltage

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
to ie power is current on voltage

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.120 
to ie power is current on voltage
voltage<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.330> constant<00:03:13.540> again<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.740> if<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.980> have

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
voltage is constant again so if you have

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.760 
voltage is constant again so if you have
high<00:03:15.489> current<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:16.780> high<00:03:17.170> power<00:03:17.470> and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
high current you have high power and

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.500 
high current you have high power and
that's<00:03:18.280> what<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.610> keep<00:03:18.819> hearing<00:03:19.030> about<00:03:19.209> with

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
that's what you keep hearing about with

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.670 
that's what you keep hearing about with
lightbulbs<00:03:20.080> here<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:20.890> 30<00:03:21.880> watt<00:03:22.300> lightbulb<00:03:23.110> 50

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
lightbulbs here but 30 watt lightbulb 50

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.220 
lightbulbs here but 30 watt lightbulb 50
watt<00:03:23.860> light<00:03:24.190> bulb<00:03:24.570> 60<00:03:25.570> watt<00:03:25.720> lightbulb

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
watt light bulb 60 watt lightbulb

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.150 
watt light bulb 60 watt lightbulb
brighter<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.190> brighter<00:03:27.340> as<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.390> wattage

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
brighter and brighter as the wattage

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.420 
brighter and brighter as the wattage
increases<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:32.470> more<00:03:32.739> current<00:03:33.250> going

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
increases with more current going

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.449 
increases with more current going
through<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.989> resistor<00:03:35.620> okay

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
through the the resistor okay

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.820 
through the the resistor okay
so<00:03:37.030> basically<00:03:37.989> we're<00:03:38.230> looking<00:03:38.260> for<00:03:38.709> the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
so basically we're looking for the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.770 
so basically we're looking for the
lowest<00:03:39.280> resistance<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.330> knew<00:03:40.600> already

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
lowest resistance so if you knew already

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.140 
lowest resistance so if you knew already
that<00:03:41.320> lowest<00:03:41.680> resistance<00:03:42.190> was<00:03:42.370> parallel<00:03:42.880> then

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
that lowest resistance was parallel then

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.870 
that lowest resistance was parallel then
you<00:03:43.269> would<00:03:43.420> choose<00:03:43.690> answer<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.650> because<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.580> is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you would choose answer a because I a is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780 
you would choose answer a because I a is
a<00:03:46.209> circuit<00:03:46.660> which<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.959> only<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.590> parallel<00:03:48.100> so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
a circuit which is only in parallel so

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.790 
a circuit which is only in parallel so
parallel<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.510> course<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:50.050> like<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.500> these

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
parallel of course is like this these

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.190 
parallel of course is like this these
are<00:03:51.010> parallel<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.610> each<00:03:51.790> other<00:03:52.030> whereas<00:03:53.019> this

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
are parallel to each other whereas this

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.650 
are parallel to each other whereas this
is<00:03:53.410> in<00:03:53.590> series<00:03:54.010> series<00:03:54.459> meaning<00:03:54.850> one<00:03:55.150> after

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
is in series series meaning one after

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.300 
is in series series meaning one after
the<00:03:55.780> other<00:03:55.810> it's<00:03:56.350> connected<00:03:56.799> one<00:03:56.950> after<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the other it's connected one after the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.000 
the other it's connected one after the
other<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:59.019> first<00:03:59.049> circuit<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.829> in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
other so the first circuit is in

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.280 
other so the first circuit is in
parallel<00:04:00.519> so<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.269> would<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.170> lowest

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
parallel so that would have the lowest

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.410 
parallel so that would have the lowest
resistance<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.370> knew<00:04:03.549> that<00:04:03.579> already

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
resistance if you knew that already

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.270 
resistance if you knew that already
and<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.350> other<00:04:08.500> extreme<00:04:09.010> would<00:04:09.220> be

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and and the the other extreme would be

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.180 
and and the the other extreme would be
figure<00:04:10.000> would<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.079> second<00:04:11.440> circuit<00:04:11.769> which

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
figure would be the second circuit which

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.090 
figure would be the second circuit which
is<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.549> series<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.230> third<00:04:14.500> circuit<00:04:14.950> is

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
is in series but the third circuit is

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.159 
is in series but the third circuit is
both<00:04:15.579> in<00:04:15.820> series<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.329> in<00:04:16.450> parallel<00:04:16.479> which

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
both in series and in parallel which

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.590 
both in series and in parallel which
means<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:17.590> going<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.829> be<00:04:17.979> in<00:04:18.190> between<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
means it's going to be in between so the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.710 
means it's going to be in between so the
one<00:04:19.810> that's<00:04:20.200> gonna<00:04:20.380> be<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.549> lowest<00:04:21.880> will<00:04:22.540> be

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
one that's gonna be the lowest will be

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.930 
one that's gonna be the lowest will be
the<00:04:23.050> one<00:04:23.229> that's<00:04:23.440> only<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:24.070> parallel<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.910> that

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the one that's only in parallel so that

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.240 
the one that's only in parallel so that
has<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.390> lowest<00:04:25.510> resistance<00:04:26.080> now<00:04:26.260> if<00:04:26.919> you're

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
has the lowest resistance now if you're

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.240 
has the lowest resistance now if you're
if<00:04:27.580> you're<00:04:27.880> sitting<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.630> exam<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:30.010> don't

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
if you're sitting the exam and you don't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.060 
if you're sitting the exam and you don't
remember<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:32.110> don't<00:04:32.229> remember<00:04:32.350> which<00:04:33.010> one

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
remember you don't remember which one

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.010 
remember you don't remember which one
has<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:34.150> lower<00:04:34.840> resistance<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.610> it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
has a lower resistance is it is it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.469 
has a lower resistance is it is it
a<00:04:39.080> series<00:04:39.770> or<00:04:40.039> is<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.370> parallel<00:04:40.940> well

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
a series or is it parallel well

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.290 
a series or is it parallel well
hopefully<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.229> minimum<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:43.370> know<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.819> the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
hopefully the minimum you know is the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.460 
hopefully the minimum you know is the
equation<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.110> relevant<00:04:45.560> equations<00:04:46.629> so<00:04:47.629> the

equation<00:04:54.319> for<00:04:54.979> series<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.240> when<00:04:56.539> I'm<00:04:56.659> writing

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
equation for series is when I'm writing

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.369 
equation for series is when I'm writing
here

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
here

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.159 
here
so<00:04:57.830> when<00:04:58.220> resistors<00:04:58.879> are<00:04:59.060> in<00:04:59.090> series<00:04:59.180> very

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
so when resistors are in series very

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.409 
so when resistors are in series very
simple<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:01.009> in<00:05:01.190> series<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.759> one<00:05:01.970> after<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
simple it's in series it's one after the

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.189 
simple it's in series it's one after the
other<00:05:02.449> so<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.110> just<00:05:03.379> add<00:05:03.530> total<00:05:04.310> resistance

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
other so you just add total resistance

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.950 
other so you just add total resistance
r1<00:05:06.199> plus<00:05:06.800> r2<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:08.360> that's<00:05:08.569> the<00:05:08.720> total

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
r1 plus r2 so that's the total

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.529 
r1 plus r2 so that's the total
resistance<00:05:09.289> going<00:05:10.060> across<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.360> two

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
resistance going across the two

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.480 
resistance going across the two
resistors<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.349> if<00:05:12.470> they're<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:12.800> parallel

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
resistors but if they're in parallel

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.029 
resistors but if they're in parallel
it's<00:05:13.940> 1<00:05:14.360> over<00:05:14.780> R<00:05:14.990> total<00:05:15.229> is<00:05:15.530> equal<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.860> 1<00:05:16.009> over

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
it's 1 over R total is equal to 1 over

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.649 
it's 1 over R total is equal to 1 over
r1<00:05:16.550> plus<00:05:16.580> 1<00:05:17.060> over<00:05:17.180> r2

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
r1 plus 1 over r2

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.680 
r1 plus 1 over r2
okay<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.169> example<00:05:19.159> so<00:05:19.669> I'm<00:05:19.880> sitting<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.360> exam

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
okay so example so I'm sitting the exam

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.309 
okay so example so I'm sitting the exam
I<00:05:20.870> can't<00:05:21.199> remember<00:05:21.500> which<00:05:21.889> one<00:05:22.159> is<00:05:22.400> lower

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
I can't remember which one is lower

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.659 
I can't remember which one is lower
resistors<00:05:24.319> in<00:05:24.470> parallel<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.220> resistance

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
resistors in parallel and resistance

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.300 
resistors in parallel and resistance
series<00:05:25.970> I<00:05:26.060> don't<00:05:26.240> remember<00:05:26.449> so<00:05:26.960> I<00:05:27.259> give<00:05:27.979> all<00:05:28.250> my

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
series I don't remember so I give all my

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.570 
series I don't remember so I give all my
resistors<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.000> resistance<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.840> 1<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.440> so<00:05:31.370> if<00:05:31.490> I

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
resistors a resistance of 1 and so if I

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.180 
resistors a resistance of 1 and so if I
give<00:05:31.759> my<00:05:31.909> resistors<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.659> resistance<00:05:33.169> of<00:05:33.289> 1<00:05:33.500> if<00:05:33.740> I

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
give my resistors a resistance of 1 if I

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.950 
give my resistors a resistance of 1 if I
have<00:05:34.310> resistors<00:05:34.729> in<00:05:34.909> series<00:05:34.940> one<00:05:35.509> after<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
have resistors in series one after the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.170 
have resistors in series one after the
other<00:05:35.990> then<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:37.069> total<00:05:37.370> resistance<00:05:37.819> is<00:05:37.969> 1

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
other then the total resistance is 1

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.809 
other then the total resistance is 1
plus<00:05:38.449> 1<00:05:38.690> which<00:05:38.719> is<00:05:38.930> 2<00:05:39.310> some<00:05:40.310> look<00:05:40.580> pretty

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
plus 1 which is 2 some look pretty

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.540 
plus 1 which is 2 some look pretty
straightforward<00:05:41.479> so<00:05:42.349> if<00:05:42.590> if<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:43.190> have

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
straightforward so if if I have

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.059 
straightforward so if if I have
resistors<00:05:44.060> oops<00:05:45.050> this<00:05:45.500> is<00:05:45.560> supposed<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:45.949> be

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
resistors oops this is supposed to be

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:53.559 
resistors oops this is supposed to be
plus<00:05:46.340> sorry<00:05:51.099> ok<00:05:52.099> so<00:05:52.400> if<00:05:52.580> I<00:05:52.669> have<00:05:52.849> resistors<00:05:53.330> in

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
plus sorry ok so if I have resistors in

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.899 
plus sorry ok so if I have resistors in
in<00:05:53.990> parallel<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:56.479> have<00:05:57.310> again<00:05:58.310> the

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
in parallel and I have again the

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.790 
in parallel and I have again the
resistors<00:05:59.449> r1<00:06:00.400> equal<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.430> 1<00:06:01.789> ohm<00:06:02.060> each

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
resistors r1 equal to 1 ohm each

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.029 
resistors r1 equal to 1 ohm each
therefore<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:04.009> would<00:06:04.130> have<00:06:04.539> 1<00:06:05.539> over<00:06:06.139> 1<00:06:06.349> plus<00:06:06.919> 1

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
therefore I would have 1 over 1 plus 1

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.120 
therefore I would have 1 over 1 plus 1
over<00:06:07.789> 1<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:08.409> 1<00:06:09.409> over<00:06:09.620> 1<00:06:09.770> plus<00:06:09.949> 1<00:06:09.979> over<00:06:10.340> 1<00:06:10.520> is<00:06:10.729> 2

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
over 1 and 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 is 2

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.180 
over 1 and 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 is 2
okay<00:06:13.130> so<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.580> have<00:06:13.849> 1<00:06:14.240> over<00:06:14.330> R<00:06:14.690> is<00:06:15.020> equal<00:06:15.289> to<00:06:15.380> 2<00:06:15.590> so

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
okay so I have 1 over R is equal to 2 so

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.920 
okay so I have 1 over R is equal to 2 so
if<00:06:16.310> I<00:06:16.400> have<00:06:16.490> 1<00:06:16.669> over<00:06:16.699> R<00:06:17.090> is<00:06:17.240> equal<00:06:17.449> to<00:06:17.479> 2<00:06:17.750> then<00:06:17.870> I

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
if I have 1 over R is equal to 2 then I

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.149 
if I have 1 over R is equal to 2 then I
cross<00:06:18.259> multiply<00:06:18.529> and<00:06:19.250> then<00:06:19.789> I<00:06:19.940> get<00:06:20.180> that<00:06:20.479> the

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
cross multiply and then I get that the

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.959 
cross multiply and then I get that the
total<00:06:22.159> resistance<00:06:22.639> is<00:06:23.180> going<00:06:23.599> to<00:06:23.870> be<00:06:24.020> 1/2<00:06:24.969> okay

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
total resistance is going to be 1/2 okay

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.129 
total resistance is going to be 1/2 okay
so<00:06:26.029> the<00:06:26.870> total<00:06:27.199> resistance<00:06:27.740> is<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.900> don't<00:06:29.900> know

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
so the total resistance is I don't know

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.659 
so the total resistance is I don't know
it's<00:06:30.319> a<00:06:30.409> very<00:06:30.620> lengthy<00:06:30.770> explanation<00:06:31.490> but<00:06:31.639> I

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
it's a very lengthy explanation but I

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.670 
it's a very lengthy explanation but I
have<00:06:31.909> to<00:06:32.029> give<00:06:32.180> it<00:06:32.300> for<00:06:32.509> its<00:06:32.870> person<00:06:33.199> with<00:06:33.349> non

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
have to give it for its person with non

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.589 
have to give it for its person with non
science<00:06:34.130> background<00:06:34.639> who's<00:06:35.060> stuck<00:06:35.330> in<00:06:35.509> the

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
science background who's stuck in the

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.749 
science background who's stuck in the
exam<00:06:35.930> and<00:06:35.960> can't<00:06:36.409> remember<00:06:36.800> if<00:06:37.039> it's<00:06:37.190> parallel

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
exam and can't remember if it's parallel

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.570 
exam and can't remember if it's parallel
or<00:06:38.000> or<00:06:38.569> series<00:06:39.110> so<00:06:39.590> if<00:06:39.919> you<00:06:40.069> can't<00:06:40.279> remember

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
or or series so if you can't remember

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.930 
or or series so if you can't remember
just<00:06:41.360> take<00:06:41.659> a<00:06:41.690> simple<00:06:42.050> number<00:06:42.710> and<00:06:43.159> work<00:06:43.759> it

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
just take a simple number and work it

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.519 
just take a simple number and work it
out<00:06:44.029> and<00:06:44.409> that's<00:06:45.409> that's<00:06:45.889> a<00:06:46.130> way<00:06:46.370> of<00:06:47.529> solving

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
out and that's that's a way of solving

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.010 
out and that's that's a way of solving
many<00:06:49.039> problems<00:06:49.130> on<00:06:49.759> the<00:06:49.969> exam<00:06:50.330> sometimes

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
many problems on the exam sometimes

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.830 
many problems on the exam sometimes
there's<00:06:51.500> something

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
there's something

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.390 
there's something
that<00:06:52.139> you<00:06:52.230> may<00:06:52.410> not<00:06:52.560> have<00:06:52.620> memorize<00:06:53.070> you<00:06:53.220> don't

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
that you may not have memorize you don't

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.970 
that you may not have memorize you don't
remember<00:06:53.639> but<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.389> sir<00:06:54.720> will<00:06:54.990> give<00:06:55.169> you<00:06:55.350> an

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
remember but a sir will give you an

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.340 
remember but a sir will give you an
outlet<00:06:56.520> so<00:06:57.030> that<00:06:57.180> you<00:06:57.360> can<00:06:57.510> reason<00:06:57.900> through<00:06:58.050> it

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
outlet so that you can reason through it

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.620 
outlet so that you can reason through it
so<00:06:59.000> so<00:07:00.000> there<00:07:00.150> you<00:07:00.240> have<00:07:00.270> it

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
so so there you have it
