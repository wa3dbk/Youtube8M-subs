00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
green and white wire that said steering

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.939 
green and white wire that said steering
wheel<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:21.170> basically<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> tapped<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
wheel and basically I tapped into that

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
wheel and basically I tapped into that
with<00:00:23.330> one<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.449> those<00:00:24.740> clamp<00:00:25.740> connectors<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:27.050> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
going down underneath the steering wheel

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:49.729

the forum to tap into as you can see
that<00:00:54.000> blue<00:00:54.270> connector<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> used

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
that blue connector is what I used
inside<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> radio<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> didn't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
inside the radio in here so I didn't

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
inside the radio in here so I didn't
have<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> cut<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:59.010> the<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:02.570> basically<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have to cut into the the basically the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
up with a voltage meter so but this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.300 
up with a voltage meter so but this
would<00:02:32.130> be<00:02:32.160> my<00:02:32.460> volume<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.650> alright<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.070> what<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
would be my volume up alright so what I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.950 
would be my volume up alright so what I
do<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.320> select<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.360> then<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> flashes

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
do is I select it and then it flashes

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.780 
do is I select it and then it flashes
down<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.920> set<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.520> my<00:02:41.550> volume<00:02:42.090> up

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
down here and I set that as my volume up

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.130 
down here and I set that as my volume up
boom<00:02:44.820> volume<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.660> set<00:02:46.760> next<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.990> I'm<00:02:48.990> gonna

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
boom volume up set next one I'm gonna

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.110 
boom volume up set next one I'm gonna
set<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:49.740> volume<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:51.410> there<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.530> go

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.150 

so<00:02:57.120> there's<00:02:57.270> two<00:02:57.420> ways<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.750> doing<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.710> then

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
so there's two ways of doing it and then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
so there's two ways of doing it and then
you<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.490> I'm<00:02:59.700> gonna<00:03:00.180> use<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.570> one<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.960> my

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you know I'm gonna use this one as my

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.530 
you know I'm gonna use this one as my
mode<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:03.320> essentially<00:03:04.320> here<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:04.590> go<00:03:05.210> like<00:03:06.210> this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
mode so essentially here we go like this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.010 
mode so essentially here we go like this
you<00:03:06.930> hit<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.170> button<00:03:07.320> they<00:03:08.220> start<00:03:08.550> flashing

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
you hit the button they start flashing

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.200 
you hit the button they start flashing
and<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.110> set<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.620> my<00:03:10.650> mode<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.060> could

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
and I set that as my mode so I could

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.160 
and I set that as my mode so I could
toggle<00:03:12.420> through<00:03:12.750> radio<00:03:13.440> TV<00:03:14.240> auxiliary<00:03:15.240> if<00:03:16.020> I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
toggle through radio TV auxiliary if I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.920 
toggle through radio TV auxiliary if I
had<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.410> iPod<00:03:16.590> it'll<00:03:17.100> go<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.670> iPod<00:03:18.210> bluetooth

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
had the iPod it'll go to iPod bluetooth

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.740 
had the iPod it'll go to iPod bluetooth

gets complicated because you see I'm

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.550 
gets complicated because you see I'm
pressing<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:27.720> my<00:03:27.930> other
