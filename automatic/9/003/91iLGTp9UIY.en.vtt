laptop and become a controller and of
course<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:20.460> channel

course this is the two channel
controller<00:00:21.360> I've<00:00:21.840> had<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.110> of<00:00:22.140> guys<00:00:22.350> asking

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
controller I've had a lot of guys asking

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
controller I've had a lot of guys asking
about<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.730> difference<00:00:24.150> between<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.450> two

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
about the difference between the two

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.210 
about the difference between the two
obviously<00:00:25.020> there's<00:00:25.260> some<00:00:25.440> major<00:00:25.710> differences

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
obviously there's some major differences

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.980 
obviously there's some major differences
to<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> four<00:00:26.760> channel<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.570> some<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to a four channel but some little

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
to a four channel but some little
nuances<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.610> actually<00:00:29.910> own

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
nuances and I've actually I actually own

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.520 
nuances and I've actually I actually own
both<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.600> least<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.930> have<00:00:31.050> used<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
both at least and I have used them in a

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.200 
both at least and I have used them in a
field<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.070> last<00:00:32.219> two<00:00:32.399> months<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
field here for last two months kind of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.400 
field here for last two months kind of
comparing<00:00:33.510> back<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> forth<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.140> wanted<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
comparing back and forth I wanted to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
comparing back and forth I wanted to
share<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> information<00:00:35.039> with<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
share some of the information with you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.279 
share some of the information with you
that<00:00:36.149> I've<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.629> found<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.989> I've<00:00:37.109> used

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
that I've kind of found as I've used

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.110 
that I've kind of found as I've used
these<00:00:37.440> two<00:00:37.620> ports<00:00:37.859> so<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.640> let's<00:00:38.910> take<00:00:39.089> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
these two ports so first let's take a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
these two ports so first let's take a
look<00:00:39.359> at<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.839> differences<00:00:40.140> between

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
look at some of the differences between

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.009 
look at some of the differences between
these<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.890> boards<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.659> yeah<00:00:42.659> we'll<00:00:42.870> talk

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
these two boards and yeah we'll talk

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.889 
these two boards and yeah we'll talk
about<00:00:43.140> how<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.559> operate<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> field<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
about how they operate the field so this

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.989 
about how they operate the field so this
is<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> VMS<00:00:46.679> 4.1<00:00:47.309> we're<00:00:47.429> looking<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.760> here

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
is the VMS 4.1 we're looking at here

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.569 
is the VMS 4.1 we're looking at here
it's<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.569> four<00:00:48.809> channel<00:00:49.170> mixer<00:00:49.489> with<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's the four channel mixer with the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's the four channel mixer with the
four<00:00:50.760> channels<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.149> gives<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> some

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
four channels that gives you some

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
four channels that gives you some
flexibility<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.530> using<00:00:52.949> channel<00:00:53.429> say

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
flexibility if you're using channel say

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
flexibility if you're using channel say

but there is a way you come on over here
we<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> analog<00:01:22.289> in<00:01:22.740> what's<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:23.700> here

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
we have the analog in what's right here

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
we have the analog in what's right here
and<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.289> that<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:26.130> can

and what you can do with that is you can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
and what you can do with that is you can
use<00:01:26.399> one<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.670> those<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> be

use one of those and if you want to be
in<00:01:27.659> USB<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:28.950> make<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.460> USB<00:01:29.880> if

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
in USB this will make this the USB if

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.959 
in USB this will make this the USB if
you<00:01:30.539> flip<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.899> now<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.579> iPod

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
you flip it now I would have that iPod

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.910

or<00:01:33.090> iPad<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.109> there's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.469> work<00:01:34.799> around

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
or iPad so there's a way to work around

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.639 
or iPad so there's a way to work around
that<00:01:35.219> with<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.609> VMS<00:01:36.240> -<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
that with the VMS - it's not the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.529 
that with the VMS - it's not the
greatest<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> smoothest<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.420> it's

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
greatest it's not the smoothest but it's

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.899 
greatest it's not the smoothest but it's
functional<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.530> emergency<00:01:41.039> backup<00:01:41.219> it's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
functional for an emergency backup it's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.919 
functional for an emergency backup it's
a<00:01:42.000> great<00:01:42.299> option<00:01:44.509> another<00:01:45.509> feature<00:01:45.719> that<00:01:45.810> I

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the MIDI settings which is what I would

done<00:03:43.230> with<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.769> couple<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.220> those<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.519> we've

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
done with a couple of those that we've

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490 
done with a couple of those that we've
been<00:03:44.880> reviewing<00:03:45.150> recently<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.200> really

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
been reviewing recently but it's really

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.410 
been reviewing recently but it's really
nice<00:03:46.650> because<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.010> have<00:03:47.040> some<00:03:47.489> good<00:03:47.970> control

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
nice because you have some good control

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.479 
nice because you have some good control
over<00:03:49.079> each<00:03:49.230> individual<00:03:49.739> channel<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.310> if<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
over each individual channel so if you

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.670 
over each individual channel so if you
need<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.700> cut<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.239> bass<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.900> channel<00:03:52.139> as

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
need to cut the bass on one channel as

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.500 
need to cut the bass on one channel as
you're<00:03:52.980> doing<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.220> mix<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:54.030> certainly<00:03:54.239> do

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
you're doing a mix you can certainly do

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.610 
you're doing a mix you can certainly do
that<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.200> again<00:03:55.500> both<00:03:55.950> boards<00:03:56.400> have<00:03:57.620> both

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
that and again both boards have both

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.979 
that and again both boards have both
boards<00:03:58.889> have<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.430> bass<00:04:00.030> mid<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.599> treble

app as you're doing your shell and

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.840 
app as you're doing your shell and
here's<00:04:45.259> probably<00:04:45.830> beyond<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.430> two-channel

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
here's probably beyond the two-channel

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.980 
here's probably beyond the two-channel
is<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.180> biggest<00:04:47.449> difference<00:04:47.720> between<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
is the biggest difference between the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.529 
is the biggest difference between the
two<00:04:48.110> boards<00:04:48.289> this<00:04:48.979> is<00:04:49.039> a<00:04:49.220> VMS<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.850> our

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
two boards this is a VMS to our

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.180 
two boards this is a VMS to our
microphone<00:04:50.720> control<00:04:51.259> we<00:04:51.740> basically<00:04:51.979> have

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
microphone control we basically have

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.100 
microphone control we basically have
on/off<00:04:52.520> which<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> same<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.180> both<00:04:53.300> we<00:04:53.990> have

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
on/off which is the same in both we have

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.200 
on/off which is the same in both we have
a<00:04:54.139> game<00:04:54.350> again<00:04:54.860> it's<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.430> similar<00:04:55.639> with<00:04:56.030> both

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
a game again it's the similar with both

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.260 
a game again it's the similar with both
but<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.020> VMs<00:04:57.380> -<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.680> only<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.130> tone<00:04:58.550> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
but and VMs - you only have a tone and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.249 
but and VMs - you only have a tone and
you<00:04:59.780> only<00:04:59.900> have<00:05:00.110> one<00:05:00.789> become<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.820> VMS<00:05:02.270> for<00:05:02.539> you

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
you only have one become the VMS for you

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.200 
you only have one become the VMS for you
have<00:05:03.410> your<00:05:03.500> on/off<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:04.130> have<00:05:04.250> your<00:05:04.400> gains<00:05:04.610> you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
have your on/off you have your gains you

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.050 
have your on/off you have your gains you
have<00:05:05.419> your<00:05:05.539> treble<00:05:05.780> mid<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.380> bass<00:05:07.070> you<00:05:07.820> have<00:05:08.030> a

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
have your treble mid and bass you have a

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.930 
have your treble mid and bass you have a
3<00:05:08.330> band<00:05:08.720> EQ<00:05:09.259> on<00:05:09.440> each<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.550> your<00:05:10.639> microphone

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
3 band EQ on each of your microphone

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.610 
3 band EQ on each of your microphone
channels<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.449> you<00:05:11.509> have<00:05:11.660> 2<00:05:11.930> microphone

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
channels and you have 2 microphone

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.589 
channels and you have 2 microphone
channels<00:05:13.009> with<00:05:13.130> this<00:05:13.310> which<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.240> course<00:05:14.270> will

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
channels with this which of course will

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.499 
channels with this which of course will
step<00:05:14.750> around<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:14.990> this<00:05:15.110> side<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:17.389> is

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
step around to this side and this is

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.180 
step around to this side and this is
another<00:05:17.720> thing<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:17.990> really<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.199> this<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.039> the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
another thing I really like this is the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.550 
another thing I really like this is the
multi<00:05:19.580> port<00:05:19.849> type<00:05:20.660> connection<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.349> can

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
multi port type connection so you can

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.800 
multi port type connection so you can
use<00:05:21.710> your<00:05:21.949> your<00:05:22.490> XLR<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.180> can<00:05:23.300> use<00:05:23.419> tip<00:05:23.630> ring

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
use your your XLR you can use tip ring

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.719 
use your your XLR you can use tip ring
sleeve<00:05:23.919> whatever<00:05:24.919> you<00:05:25.009> have<00:05:25.160> for<00:05:25.280> microphone

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
sleeve whatever you have for microphone

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.420 
sleeve whatever you have for microphone
can<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.210> plugged<00:05:26.419> in<00:05:26.599> that's<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.259> VMS<00:05:27.560> 40.1

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
can you plugged in that's the VMS 40.1

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.879 
can you plugged in that's the VMS 40.1
and<00:05:28.729> here<00:05:29.210> we<00:05:29.300> are<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.660> VMS<00:05:29.960> -<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.740> one

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
and here we are with the VMS - the one

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.640 
and here we are with the VMS - the one
microphone<00:05:31.340> input<00:05:31.669> but<00:05:32.150> again<00:05:32.300> it's<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.539> same

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
microphone input but again it's the same

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.350 
microphone input but again it's the same
professional<00:05:33.650> quality<00:05:34.150> connection<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:35.330> you

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
professional quality connection so you

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.430 
professional quality connection so you
can<00:05:35.570> do<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.870> variety<00:05:36.080> of<00:05:36.320> different

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
can do a variety of different

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.189 
can do a variety of different
microphones<00:05:36.979> into<00:05:37.460> this<00:05:37.580> board<00:05:38.199> another

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
microphones into this board another

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.080 
microphones into this board another
difference<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.830> width<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.669> these<00:05:40.760> boards

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
difference is the width of these boards

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.570 
difference is the width of these boards
you'll<00:05:41.389> notice<00:05:41.630> that<00:05:41.840> of<00:05:42.349> course<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:42.800> VMS<00:05:43.099> 4.1

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
you'll notice that of course the VMS 4.1

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.909 
you'll notice that of course the VMS 4.1
is<00:05:43.760> wider<00:05:44.030> put<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> tape<00:05:45.139> measure<00:05:45.349> here<00:05:45.620> you'll

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
is wider put a tape measure here you'll

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.730 
is wider put a tape measure here you'll
see<00:05:46.280> that<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.760> VMS<00:05:47.210> 2<00:05:47.599> is<00:05:47.810> about<00:05:47.990> 15<00:05:48.409> inches

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
see that the VMS 2 is about 15 inches

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.770 
see that the VMS 2 is about 15 inches
wide<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.250> has<00:05:49.669> wings<00:05:50.120> they'll<00:05:50.360> come<00:05:50.479> with<00:05:50.630> it

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
wide it has wings they'll come with it

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.850 
wide it has wings they'll come with it

sound quality sound quality between the

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.510 
sound quality sound quality between the
two<00:06:05.570> I<00:06:05.800> really<00:06:06.800> couldn't<00:06:07.009> tell<00:06:07.159> much<00:06:07.340> of<00:06:07.370> a

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
two I really couldn't tell much of a

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.610 
two I really couldn't tell much of a
difference<00:06:07.759> -<00:06:07.880> -<00:06:08.120> they<00:06:08.270> both<00:06:08.509> have<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:09.259> very

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
difference - - they both have a very

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.980 
difference - - they both have a very
very<00:06:09.919> good<00:06:10.039> sound<00:06:10.310> quality<00:06:10.419> one<00:06:11.419> thing<00:06:11.659> that

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
very good sound quality one thing that

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.629 
very good sound quality one thing that
you<00:06:12.080> will<00:06:12.259> notice<00:06:12.409> and<00:06:13.039> again<00:06:13.280> keep<00:06:13.490> in<00:06:13.610> mind

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
you will notice and again keep in mind

you will notice and again keep in mind
of<00:06:13.820> the<00:06:13.880> price<00:06:14.060> point<00:06:14.270> these<00:06:14.449> are<00:06:14.659> a<00:06:14.690> mid-level

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
of the price point these are a mid-level

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.219 
of the price point these are a mid-level
the<00:06:16.490> mid-level<00:06:16.940> board<00:06:17.120> is<00:06:17.270> that<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:18.020> will

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
the mid-level board is that you will

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.680 
the mid-level board is that you will
hear<00:06:18.650> just<00:06:19.039> a<00:06:19.130> touch<00:06:19.340> bit<00:06:19.580> of<00:06:19.669> noise<00:06:19.789> from<00:06:20.479> the

I've<00:06:21.919> had<00:06:22.190> some<00:06:22.669> boards<00:06:22.909> that<00:06:23.030> have<00:06:23.150> been<00:06:23.270> a

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
I've had some boards that have been a

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.149 
I've had some boards that have been a
ton<00:06:23.900> louder<00:06:24.139> and<00:06:24.409> I've<00:06:24.530> had<00:06:24.650> some<00:06:24.800> that<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:24.979> bit

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
ton louder and I've had some that a bit

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.029 
ton louder and I've had some that a bit
lighter<00:06:25.370> but<00:06:26.000> you<00:06:26.270> will<00:06:26.479> hear<00:06:26.840> a<00:06:26.990> faint<00:06:27.289> hiss

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
lighter but you will hear a faint hiss

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.210 
lighter but you will hear a faint hiss
from<00:06:28.520> the<00:06:28.669> microphone<00:06:29.060> very<00:06:29.870> very<00:06:30.500> faint<00:06:30.860> but

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
from the microphone very very faint but

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.279 
from the microphone very very faint but
if<00:06:31.340> you're<00:06:31.550> really<00:06:32.060> looking<00:06:32.300> for<00:06:32.509> it<00:06:32.810> you<00:06:33.050> can

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
if you're really looking for it you can

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.100 
if you're really looking for it you can
find<00:06:33.590> it<00:06:33.710> I<00:06:34.099> don't<00:06:34.759> if<00:06:35.419> I<00:06:35.509> can<00:06:35.539> adjust<00:06:35.960> the

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
find it I don't if I can adjust the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.690 
find it I don't if I can adjust the
volumes<00:06:36.409> a<00:06:36.469> little<00:06:36.680> bit<00:06:36.800> on<00:06:36.889> the<00:06:36.979> boards<00:06:37.219> I<00:06:37.340> can

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
volumes a little bit on the boards I can

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.790 
volumes a little bit on the boards I can
lose<00:06:37.969> it<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.479> yet<00:06:38.930> still<00:06:39.139> have<00:06:39.289> a<00:06:39.320> very<00:06:39.620> loud

lose it and yet still have a very loud

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.350 
lose it and yet still have a very loud
microphone<00:06:40.310> it<00:06:40.430> just<00:06:40.580> takes<00:06:40.729> a<00:06:40.820> little<00:06:41.000> tweak

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
microphone it just takes a little tweak

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.360 
microphone it just takes a little tweak
so<00:06:41.599> just<00:06:42.289> something<00:06:42.770> I<00:06:42.830> want<00:06:43.009> to<00:06:43.039> be<00:06:43.129> straight

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
so just something I want to be straight

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.550 
so just something I want to be straight
up<00:06:43.400> with<00:06:43.520> you<00:06:43.759> that<00:06:44.419> there<00:06:44.599> is<00:06:44.629> a<00:06:44.990> little<00:06:45.470> bit

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
up with you that there is a little bit

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.290 
up with you that there is a little bit
of<00:06:45.620> noise<00:06:45.680> on<00:06:45.889> that<00:06:46.009> my<00:06:46.099> channel<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.610> it<00:06:47.090> enough

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
of noise on that my channel is it enough

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.420 
of noise on that my channel is it enough
to<00:06:47.449> be<00:06:47.569> bothersome<00:06:48.020> no<00:06:48.590> one<00:06:48.740> will<00:06:48.889> know<00:06:49.039> you

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
to be bothersome no one will know you

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.589 
to be bothersome no one will know you
will<00:06:49.550> be<00:06:49.639> the<00:06:49.729> only<00:06:49.909> one<00:06:50.060> who<00:06:50.210> will<00:06:50.300> know<00:06:50.449> it

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 
will be the only one who will know it

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.929 
will be the only one who will know it
and<00:06:50.629> mainly<00:06:51.110> because<00:06:51.229> I<00:06:51.590> just<00:06:51.919> said<00:06:52.069> it<00:06:52.189> but

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:52.939 
and mainly because I just said it but

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.230
