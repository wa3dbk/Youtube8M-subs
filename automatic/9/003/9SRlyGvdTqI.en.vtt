00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.410
 good afternoon to all of our 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.200
 followers on our youtube channel 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.490
 today we are going to play a song well 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.470
 important 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.750
 and it is the manipulation of our dogs 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.360
 the importance of manipulating them 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.020
 that they are very puppies 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.980
 for many owners it is a problem 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.570
 really great to find that your 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.200
 dog when it comes to review 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.630
 veterinary 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.340
 he does not allow himself to be manipulated he is not allowed to revise 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 the mouth is not allowed to make a cut of 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.300
 nails do not stop checking the belly or 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.010
 he does not allow himself to be checked in the skin and this is 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.570
 it becomes a problem of dimensions 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.570
 older than someone many dogs 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 reach a level of stress so high that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.910
 they even become aggressive that's why 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.080
 fundamental that from very small 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.580
 let's start manipulating them that start 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:04.309
 make part of your daily routine on 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.310
 I grope being touching them being 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.030
 reviewing the different parts of your 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.740
 body 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.790
 preparing for a future revision 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.550
 veterinary 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.070
 this is especially important 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 in big breed dogs that we start 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.080
 since they are very small and even 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.790
 in small breeds also especially 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 dogs like the georges hayter by 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.120
 example in this case margarita our 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 student you have to work on the part of 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.470
 manipulation and also of hairstyle since 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 many of them become supremely 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.820
 reluctant to make hairstyles and take it as 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.560
 something very negative and if they want to find 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.060
 accustom our puppies and how 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.160
 accustom our adult dogs to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.119
