00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.210
 scene 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.680
 Hello 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.680
 It is the end drop of mga 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:43.550
 This time , I would like to introduce a drill for balance making to strengthen management 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.230
 The balance here is mainly 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.230
 It is before and after balancing the address 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 About 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:58.950
 As weight is collected in the part said to divide the brand part of the next base 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.950
 Address 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:08.900
 In still wet in there also backswing if possible 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:17.230
 Let's be able to park swing 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.230
 Because I want to help the shrine if I bought someone in the prefecture by backswing 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.970
 I have to cross shaft 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.970
 Swing is stable 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.420
 First of all I would like to introduce the first stage drill 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.980
 The way is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.240
 Hmm 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.170
 Or the right of the price 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.610
 Address across the red house 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.060
 Let's hit the ball 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.060
 I am 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.020
 down 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.720
 By pinching the ball under the right month 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.069
 The game will take the lead at the time of evil soon 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.230
 Right 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.990
 I think that I can experience from collecting earlier Ne base of the thumb 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.060
 in addition 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:37.250
 It feels like everyone's hips got a little higher 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.250
 I can make a needle for teaching 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.490
 Next is the second group eye 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.310
 The second step is 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:53.790
 Common 8 people 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.230
 The swing that raised the right heel with the image that he had a ball in grass 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.950
 Let's try 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 watch 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.319
 Four days 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:22.260
 If you are in the second phase of trading 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:25.730
 If the right kagako has been stuck in the back swing 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.730
 Let's do it with the building 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.530
 Now the third step 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.110
 It is tolyl 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.569
 Initially 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.540
 The first step is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:47.470
 I was holding a ball under a large amount 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 The fifth step seems to be held by two people 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:57.360
 Or the right of it was live back a little floated in the head with image 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.360
 In the 33rd time when this can be done 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.870
 Keep Kato lightly on the ground 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.900
 Feeling that weight does not get on the heel by back swing 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.829
 I can feel it 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.829
 Let's practice 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.440
 I would like to explain the points of caution through this drill 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.390
 First one 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.849
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.289
 Good of the firm weight on the hip joint 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:45.810
 Right 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.960
 Feeling that weight is gathered in the ball of the ball wearing a thumb 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.729
 N dot 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.860
 Among them there are two checkpoints 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.129
 First one eye 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.380
 okay 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:03.440
 If you do not let the film hang against the film, your knees will flow a little 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.220
 Various regular co-ops 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.960
 The possibility comes out 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.420
 Another 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.260
 Firmly with the right thumb ball 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.470
 It is snowing in the flow of the venue 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:23.670
 I believe in making a needle firmly 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.670
 If this can not be made, it will lead to the movement that the right waist is closing 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.449
 In practicing any of these three 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.190
 Something to top Well or another mapped twice or did not go well captain 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.400
 Big gun of 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.270
 successfully 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.190
 When not collected to the right 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:49.729
 Please go back and practice before the best effect 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.960
 It had by that master this drill 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.169
 Balance before and after 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:01.939
 Getting to feel it 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.939
 You can practice at the studio practice area that makes us strong 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:11.610
 Everyone also try this drill 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.610
 Get a strong dance for
