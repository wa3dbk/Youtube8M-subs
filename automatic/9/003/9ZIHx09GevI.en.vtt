it's<00:00:15.960> kind<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:17.900> common<00:00:18.900> thing<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.109> mobile

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's kind of a common thing for mobile

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.429 
it's kind of a common thing for mobile
phones<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.460> her<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:22.080> was<00:00:22.170> actually

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
phones to do her game that was actually

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.849 
phones to do her game that was actually
just<00:00:22.470> putting<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.100> new<00:00:23.250> game<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
just putting this in my new game and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
just putting this in my new game and
notice<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> things

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
notice that like some of the things

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.250 
notice that like some of the things
people<00:00:27.930> use<00:00:28.109> maybe<00:00:28.710> maybe<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.840> mean<00:00:30.840> they're

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
people use maybe maybe I mean they're

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.420 
people use maybe maybe I mean they're
all<00:00:31.410> right<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.830> work<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.160> right

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
all right they work all right

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
all right they work all right
but<00:00:32.910> switch-case<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.989> definitely<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
but switch-case is definitely the way to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.830 
but switch-case is definitely the way to
do<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:37.309> actually<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.489> am<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.270> made

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
do it I think and actually I am I made

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280 
do it I think and actually I am I made
this<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:40.590> efficient<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.420> don't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this a lot more efficient so I don't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
this a lot more efficient so I don't
know<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.070> runs<00:00:44.219> better<00:00:44.550> than<00:00:44.700> than

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
know I think it runs better than than

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
know I think it runs better than than
anything<00:00:45.600> anybody<00:00:46.020> else<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:46.850> I<00:00:47.850> mean<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
anything anybody else has I mean I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.619 
anything anybody else has I mean I
haven't<00:00:48.750> seen<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.200> obviously<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:51.090> uh<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
haven't seen it all obviously but uh I

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
haven't seen it all obviously but uh I
mean<00:00:52.379> yeah<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.739> works<00:00:52.920> pretty<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.780> I'll

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
mean yeah this works pretty well so I'll

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.860 
mean yeah this works pretty well so I'll
go<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> description

greater<00:01:21.150> than<00:01:21.530> zero<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.130> starts<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.299> we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
greater than zero it starts and then we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420 
greater than zero it starts and then we
have<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:24.869> case<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.250> touch

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
have this first case when the touch
begins<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.000> gets<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.299> start<00:01:27.540> touch<00:01:27.810> position

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
begins it gets your start touch position

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.880 
begins it gets your start touch position
and<00:01:28.820> then<00:01:30.740> when<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> ends<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.680> check<00:01:34.680> your

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and then when it ends it will check your

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.030 
and then when it ends it will check your
your<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.090> vertical<00:01:36.540> swipe<00:01:36.750> distance<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> if

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
your your vertical swipe distance and if

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
your your vertical swipe distance and if
that's<00:01:38.280> greater<00:01:38.700> than<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.090> minimum<00:01:39.680> swipe

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's greater than the minimum swipe

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.380 
that's greater than the minimum swipe
distance<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.869> will<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.119> tell

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
distance up here it will it will tell

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.340 
distance up here it will it will tell
you<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:47.790> tell<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.140> or

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you if we will tell you if it's an up or

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:59.160 
you if we will tell you if it's an up or
down<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:53.479> bit<00:01:54.479> based<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> value<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.780> yeah

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
down a bit based on the value so yeah

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.200 
down a bit based on the value so yeah
so<00:01:59.860> that's<00:02:00.040> that's<00:02:00.250> four<00:02:00.490> up<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.729> down<00:02:00.940> right

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
so that's that's four up and down right

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.080 
so that's that's four up and down right
and<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:01.720> for<00:02:02.530> horizontal<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:03.880> this

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
and then for horizontal we have this

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.680 
and then for horizontal we have this
here<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:06.250> will<00:02:06.340> take<00:02:06.520> your<00:02:06.670> swipe<00:02:06.909> or<00:02:07.240> your

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
here and it will take your swipe or your

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.889 
here and it will take your swipe or your
horizontal<00:02:08.250> swipe<00:02:09.250> distance<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.090> then<00:02:10.600> if

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
horizontal swipe distance and then if

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.390 
horizontal swipe distance and then if
that's<00:02:11.140> greater<00:02:11.380> than<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.709> minimum<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.220> it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that's greater than the minimum of it

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.000 
that's greater than the minimum of it
will<00:02:12.490> be<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.610> same<00:02:12.910> thing<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.630> then<00:02:17.010> if

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
will be the same thing here and then if

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.250 
will be the same thing here and then if
it's<00:02:18.220> if<00:02:18.490> it's<00:02:18.640> greater<00:02:18.910> than<00:02:19.030> zero<00:02:19.260> it'll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
it's if it's greater than zero it'll

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.130 
it's if it's greater than zero it'll
it'll<00:02:20.560> move<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.980> it'll<00:02:21.220> tell<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.930> it'll<00:02:22.930> sense

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
it'll move it it'll tell it it'll sense

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.020 
it'll move it it'll tell it it'll sense
it's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.740> swipe<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.459> if<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.790> less

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it's a right swipe and then if it's less

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.540
