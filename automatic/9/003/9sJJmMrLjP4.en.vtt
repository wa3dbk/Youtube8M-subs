seen<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> latest<00:02:50.459> reports<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.269> you've<00:02:51.420> been

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
seen the latest reports but you've been

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.199 
seen the latest reports but you've been
able<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.930> play<00:02:52.920> games<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.730> stuff<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
able to play games and stuff like that

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.500 
able to play games and stuff like that
and<00:02:54.359> use<00:02:54.660> controllers<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.769> by<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.190> micro<00:02:57.150> USB

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and use controllers and by the micro USB

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.150 
and use controllers and by the micro USB
port<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.870> would<00:02:58.019> happen<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.410> 3.1<00:02:58.950> update

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
port that would happen with 3.1 update

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.900 
port that would happen with 3.1 update
but<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.480> quite<00:03:00.690> interesting<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.889> so<00:03:02.340> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
but it's quite interesting and so you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.839 
but it's quite interesting and so you
know<00:03:03.440> we<00:03:04.440> would<00:03:04.530> much<00:03:04.950> rather<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.519> able<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
know we would much rather be able to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.550 
know we would much rather be able to
charge<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.299> by<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> mountaineers<00:03:06.989> people<00:03:07.410> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
charge it by the mountaineers people to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.199 
charge it by the mountaineers people to
be<00:03:07.650> honest<00:03:07.859> with<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.099> now<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.849> means<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> you

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
be honest with you now it means that you

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.729 
be honest with you now it means that you
have<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.359> carry<00:03:09.690> another<00:03:09.989> cable<00:03:10.260> with<00:03:10.470> us<00:03:10.590> on

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
have to carry another cable with us on

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.930 
have to carry another cable with us on
the<00:03:10.799> charger

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the charger

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.940

I'm<00:03:12.510> said<00:03:12.900> before<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.320> 10.1<00:03:13.710> screen

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
I'm said before this is a 10.1 screen

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.760 
I'm said before this is a 10.1 screen
wait<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.490> bit<00:03:14.670> too<00:03:15.570> bad<00:03:15.780> i<00:03:16.080> mean<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.620> similar

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
wait a bit too bad i mean it's similar

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.970 
wait a bit too bad i mean it's similar
to<00:03:16.890> set<00:03:17.190> grams<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:19.050> can<00:03:19.230> feel<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.800> weight

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
to set grams and you can feel the weight

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.530 
to set grams and you can feel the weight
of<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.250> your<00:03:20.400> hand<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.940> probably<00:03:21.180> won't<00:03:21.480> want

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
of it your hand you probably won't want

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.050 
of it your hand you probably won't want
to<00:03:21.720> hold<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.710> your<00:03:22.740> hand<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.670> very<00:03:23.850> long

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
to hold it in your hand for very long

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.700 
to hold it in your hand for very long
periods<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.570> time<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.230> probably<00:03:25.410> worth

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
periods of time so it's probably worth

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.590 
periods of time so it's probably worth
investing<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.520> some<00:03:26.730> sort<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.060> stand<00:03:27.390> or

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
investing in some sort of stand or

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.440 
investing in some sort of stand or
something<00:03:28.160> but<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.310> know<00:03:29.430> whether<00:03:29.670> we're

charger here this is more like a laptop
chargers<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.170> quite<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.710> chunky<00:04:14.310> charger<00:04:14.880> and

we<00:04:15.660> have<00:04:15.810> noted<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> lot<00:04:16.560> people<00:04:16.709> report

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100

we have noted that a lot people report
it<00:04:17.340> does<00:04:17.459> return<00:04:17.669> charge<00:04:18.239> pretty<00:04:18.570> quickly<00:04:18.870> so

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it does return charge pretty quickly so

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.500 
it does return charge pretty quickly so
it's<00:04:19.380> probably<00:04:19.709> due<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.330> discharge<00:04:21.330> from

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
it's probably due to discharge from

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.190 
it's probably due to discharge from
being<00:04:21.900> honest<00:04:22.230> so<00:04:22.640> that's<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.750> charger

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
being honest so that's the the charger

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.659 
being honest so that's the the charger
for<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.830> that's<00:04:26.250> one<00:04:26.640> part<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:28.340> as<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.490> move

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.390 

base<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.960> charge<00:04:37.230> port<00:04:37.470> which<00:04:37.740> does<00:04:38.130> remember

base of charge port which does remember

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.850 
base of charge port which does remember
much<00:04:38.700> like<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> normal<00:04:39.690> laptop<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.650> your

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
much like a normal laptop this is your

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
much like a normal laptop this is your
actual<00:04:41.010> charges<00:04:41.550> might<00:04:42.090> be<00:04:42.270> very<00:04:42.600> much<00:04:42.720> about

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
actual charges might be very much about

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.700 
actual charges might be very much about
the<00:04:43.140> Nokia<00:04:43.560> very<00:04:44.520> thin<00:04:45.030> wall<00:04:45.960> charger<00:04:46.470> for

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
the Nokia very thin wall charger for

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.750 
the Nokia very thin wall charger for
everyone<00:04:47.040> stick<00:04:47.940> with<00:04:48.060> micro<00:04:48.480> USB<00:04:48.960> s<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:49.380> I

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
everyone stick with micro USB s but I

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.810 
everyone stick with micro USB s but I
guess<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.060> case<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.220> bit<00:04:53.400> different

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
guess in this case it's a bit different

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.390 
guess in this case it's a bit different
