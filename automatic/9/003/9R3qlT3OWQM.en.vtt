00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
 padang 

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.240
 well that in Chile the persecution is very perverse but the hearts of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.950
 straight people are very strong I come to see a report on the persecution of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.879
 falun gong 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 I had this idea that used as the basis of my painting 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.600
 the suffering in China of Lithuanians represents a home destroyed by the 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.630
 Violent persecution of Falun Gong by the Communist Party 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 the piece of crumpled paper in this man's hand indicates that he was in a 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.999
 brainwashing center 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.370
 to force him to give up his spiritual practice 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.630
 In the face of tragedy, the young widow stands with integrity and strength 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.470
 inside 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.640
 all this stand out private 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.159
 if by this it is understood it is usual 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.289
 so I think that someone who is an artist and a spiritual person 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.230
 has a certain responsibility 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's like the artists of the past 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 the first Christians suffered persecution 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 and then the artists saw how their should represent that I think being a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 artist implies having a society responsibility for that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 it is not surprising that in this first event of its kind at world level so that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.580
 Chinese artists can express themselves freely and share their work on 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.710
 theme of spirituality and the oppression of spirituality on the part of the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 Chinese regime occupy such a prominent place indeed 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 in a sad twist of fate 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.360
 the winner of the silver competition of the painting competition 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.560
 ten minutes fan 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.850
 He was arrested and imprisoned in a forced labor camp for practicing Falun 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.890
 gong 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 apparently he was persecuted by the communist authorities shortly after 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 who presented his winning painting 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.290
 titled child in Tibetan 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.650
 since the date of the Olympic Games he was imprisoned and placed in a camp 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.630
 forced labor in china 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.610
 where it continues to be right now unfortunately this is because it practices 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.920
 falun gong which is a traditional Chinese practice that is persecuted once 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 in 1999 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.420
 this is something for which we in tikrit ipi are deeply 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.949
 saddened and we hope it ends in the near future 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.269
 is a sign of the unique opportunity to share your work that is 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.639
 competition represents for Chinese artists who are willing to run 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.969
 personal risks to participate 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.639
 although the situation of chi minh fa 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.120
 remains delicate 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.750
 and he could not be interviewed by independent means another competitor the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.120
 winner of the lichuan honor award shares his opinion on the value of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.789
 the series of competencies of 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.389
 I think that new dynasty tang television when performing this kind of 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.859
 competencies can really start a return to the straight foundations of the arts 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.459
 which is a very significant idea and this can have a profound effect 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.879
 historical 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.969
 I think that people will gradually be more and more clear about this 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.980
 I've seen that the various competitions in this series held over 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.740
 they have all been very broad and with a deep cultural level 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.390
 and of meaning
