00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.580
 I hope you are very well in this 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 I'm going to make a stitch of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.439
 embroidery and I'm going to apply it on this handle 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.730
 and you know you can apply it in the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.520
 design of your preference 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.240
 was going to be a combined handle and for 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.070
 pointed I'm going to use these three tones and 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.160
 as always you can use the colors 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 that you want 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 with this strong tone in simple thread 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 I already have five lines here and we're going to go 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.650
 back we're going to work the two strands 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 together the two colors together the two 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.210
 they are going to do in a simple thread I already have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.900
 this needle here with the one just 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 make my five lines vertically and with 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 the other tone I also have my needle 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.370
 I'm going to leave the pitch needle pending 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.360
 strong and with the simple tone I return to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.360
 make five lines 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.940
 five lines in vertical together we're going to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.940
 go alternating the lines 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 five strong lines and five lines 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.450
 clear like that until filling our design 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.060
 with these threads 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.610
 with these vertical lines 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.970
 I already have the five lines of each of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.009
 the colors I got rid of these tones and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.890
 now with the third tone that is going to be 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.310
 this in single strand I already have fixed 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.140
 here the thread on the earth and we're going to 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.600
 pass it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.350
 evra of this tone above the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.650
 clear of the light tone and below the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.310
 lines of the second 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.700
 of the strongest color above by 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 down 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.580
 above the light color and below 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.300
 of strong color 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 I already passed my thread of the 3rd tone over 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.119
 and below above and below until 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.569
 get to the contour I went back to take out and 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 I'm going to do this same step 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.000
 four times more so that in total it has 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.480
 the five lines of this tone 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.519
 the five lines are already 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.409
 these were left to the strong color 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.659
 up and the light color down now 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.209
 let's do the opposite good and let 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.459
 a space to do these again 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.600
 five lines and we're going to make them 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.020
 on the contrary bat is like a saucer 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.470
 let's put now below the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.470
 clear 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.700
 and above the strong color 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.800
 up the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.990
 above the color of the strong color and below 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 of the clear 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.930
 above the strong color and below the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.260
 Clear 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.270
 above 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 down the five lines 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.480
 up down the 5 lines 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.480
 above 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650
 down 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.700
 fixed to me and I'm going to repeat 5 times 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 this same 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.790
 and I will go alternating and I have my 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.420
 horizontal lines 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.310
 in one of the strong color lines 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.459
 of the strong yellow were left up and in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.950
 the next row down up and down and 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.060
 the light color contrary to what 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.040
 the lines were left 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.290
 strong down up up down now 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.890
 with this same thread of the third shift 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.650
 let's put the needle diagonally 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.870
 each of the lines of the third tone 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.129
 only below the lines 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.129
 down the lines 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.920
 down like this 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.489
 they have told me not to get too close 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 the embroidery towards the camera because 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.130
 erase good ones that do not reach to appreciate 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.880
 I try to push it away but I feel 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.200
 that way he does not appreciate in good way how I do 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.280
 the stitch 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.590
 touch is 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.350
 only below the lines in 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.350
 diagonal of the third take like this 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.220
 because I already fixed here in the contour of the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.220
 apple and I happened to the next row 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.790
 to this row 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.020
 and the same 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.940
 down from the third tone down below 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.400
 down 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.580
 well until finishing each of the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.120
 diagonal rows and lines in 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.120
 horizontal 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.860
 the lines are already in this sense 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.569
 now let's do them in the sense 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.409
 contrary 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:33.610
 here I have my thread and I put the same 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.560
 needle below the lines of the third 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:41.050
 tone the lines horizontally 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.050
 below below 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.870
 under 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.580
 in diagonals I'm not doing 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.479
 wheat 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.479
 and I pass to the next 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.330
 and so let's have it again in 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.330
 all diagonal lines 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.009
 I finished making the lines in the 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.129
 Wrong Way 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.190
 and with both lines diagonally 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.710
 they formed these little eyes 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.070
 these little eyes if you want 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.650
 highlight these diamonds you can put another 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.960
 completely different color so that 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.139
 highlight the diamond 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.569
 and why do you like the stitch for a 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.789
 basket a vase or vase for 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:50.590
 large fruits small fruits any 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:52.419
 kind of fruit for a strawberry these 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.690
 You can do horizontal lines in 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.080
 black and your strawberry is even 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.270
 even for a princess dress 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.569
 Once you put the proper colors 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.139
 every princess who wears her dress and 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:11.650
 with that stitch you can apply it and 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:16.449
 this time I want to thank my 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:19.330
 friends and friends who see me from Spain 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.830

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:26.380
 videos you would see from there from Peru 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:30.509
