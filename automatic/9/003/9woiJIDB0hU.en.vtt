as<00:02:44.550> well<00:02:44.730> i<00:02:45.030> don't<00:02:45.210> think<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.570> gives<00:02:45.720> quite<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
as well i don't think it gives quite the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.590 
as well i don't think it gives quite the
same<00:02:46.800> results<00:02:47.370> as<00:02:47.550> why<00:02:48.150> i<00:02:48.180> use<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> hang

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
same results as why i use the hang

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.320 
same results as why i use the hang
straight<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:48.990> works<00:02:49.230> almost<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.890> well<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:51.300> i

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
straight but works almost as well so i

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.940 
straight but works almost as well so i
just<00:02:51.510> wanted<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> alert<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.590> right
