right<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:37.129> I'll<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
right over here I'll start with the

right over here I'll start with the
table<00:00:39.149> top<00:00:39.329> today<00:00:41.300> after<00:00:42.300> rough<00:00:42.540> cutting<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
table top today after rough cutting the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080 
table top today after rough cutting the
lengths<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> skill<00:00:43.770> saw<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.700> lay<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
lengths with a skill saw I'll lay out a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.779 
lengths with a skill saw I'll lay out a
grading<00:00:45.480> pattern<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> looks<00:00:46.170> decent<00:00:46.789> I'll

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
grading pattern that looks decent I'll

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
grading pattern that looks decent I'll
also<00:00:48.090> try<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> minimize<00:00:48.780> any<00:00:49.410> cupping<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
also try to minimize any cupping on the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
also try to minimize any cupping on the
top<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.940> alternating<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> natural<00:00:52.170> curve<00:00:52.469> of

top by alternating the natural curve of
each<00:00:52.800> board<00:00:53.239> with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> positioning<00:00:54.809> done

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
each board with the positioning done

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
each board with the positioning done
I'll<00:00:55.289> mark<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> order<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> stock<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I'll mark the order of the stock for the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.950 
I'll mark the order of the stock for the
glue<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:58.520> next<00:00:59.520> I'll<00:00:59.670> rip<00:00:59.940> each<00:01:00.120> piece<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
glue up next I'll rip each piece to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.849 
glue up next I'll rip each piece to
equal<00:01:01.260> dimensions

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
equal dimensions

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.260 
equal dimensions
I<00:01:02.870> want<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.989> rough<00:01:04.290> cut<00:01:04.530> top<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.250> end<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.700> 1/2

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I want my rough cut top to end up 1/2

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.220 
I want my rough cut top to end up 1/2
inch<00:01:06.570> over<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> finished<00:01:07.560> width

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.200 

then<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.830> couple<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> passes<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.910> jointer

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
then a couple of passes on the jointer

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.190 
then a couple of passes on the jointer
and<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:13.410> ready<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.830> glue<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.870> as<00:01:15.870> always

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and we're ready for glue up as always

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
and we're ready for glue up as always
I'll<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> dry<00:01:17.280> run<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.880> clamps<00:01:18.240> first

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I'll do a dry run with the clamps first

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.430 
I'll do a dry run with the clamps first
to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.200> things<00:01:19.440> set<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.710> correctly<00:01:20.190> as<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:22.230> set

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
to get things set up correctly as I set

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.470 
to get things set up correctly as I set
up<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> clamps<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.490> use<00:01:23.730> scraps<00:01:24.120> on<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
up the clamps I'll use scraps on the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.720 
up the clamps I'll use scraps on the
outer<00:01:24.630> edges<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.590> minimize<00:01:25.950> any<00:01:26.250> clamp<00:01:26.520> marks

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
outer edges to minimize any clamp marks

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.230 
outer edges to minimize any clamp marks
just<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.190> leg<00:01:29.400> glue<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.030> last

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
just like the leg glue up in the last

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870 
just like the leg glue up in the last
video<00:01:30.570> I'll<00:01:31.230> add<00:01:31.500> glue<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> both<00:01:32.100> surfaces

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
video I'll add glue to both surfaces

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
video I'll add glue to both surfaces
being<00:01:33.090> joined<00:01:35.870> if<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.020> joints<00:01:37.380> look<00:01:37.530> good

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
being joined if the joints look good

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
being joined if the joints look good
I'll<00:01:38.340> mill<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.420> finished

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

jointer with the two drawer openings my
front<00:02:05.610> apron<00:02:05.700> requires<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.690> more<00:02:06.720> work

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
front apron requires a bit more work

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.400 
front apron requires a bit more work
though<00:02:07.790> I've<00:02:08.790> got<00:02:09.119> five<00:02:09.420> components<00:02:10.110> milled

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.330 
though I've got five components milled
and<00:02:10.649> joined<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> front<00:02:11.550> apron<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:13.340> started

now I'll mark and drill down to join all

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.170 
now I'll mark and drill down to join all
the<00:02:31.500> components<00:02:32.010> together

assembly is seated flat in your clamps

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.360 
assembly is seated flat in your clamps
so<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.680> doesn't<00:02:42.980> end<00:02:43.069> up<00:02:43.250> warped<00:02:43.730> after<00:02:44.060> dry

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
