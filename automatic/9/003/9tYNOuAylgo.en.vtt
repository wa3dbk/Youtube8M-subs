00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
SMGs because they didn't have really any

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
something but with the LMGs it just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.080 
something but with the LMGs it just
feels<00:01:42.440> like<00:01:42.740> you're<00:01:42.950> putting<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.700> know<00:01:43.790> led

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
put it on with a thermal and just lay

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.280 
put it on with a thermal and just lay
down<00:02:01.549> somewhere<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.780> laser<00:02:03.020> beam

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
down somewhere and it's a laser beam

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.070 
down somewhere and it's a laser beam
across<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.799> map<00:02:03.979> has<00:02:04.340> no<00:02:04.549> recoil<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.270> it's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
across the map has no recoil and it's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.020 
across the map has no recoil and it's
just<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.320> sniper<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:07.010> has<00:02:07.100> no<00:02:07.280> recoil<00:02:07.670> and

just a sniper that has no recoil and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.260 
just a sniper that has no recoil and
it's<00:02:08.720> automatic<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.769> it's<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.670> pretty<00:02:10.849> good<00:02:11.060> gun

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.640 
it and you know now would that have
silencer<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:07.879> stuff<00:03:08.389> like<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.599> maybe<00:03:09.049> if<00:03:09.560> I

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
silencer and stuff like that maybe if I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.410

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
can get another mode with its but so you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.670 
can get another mode with its but so you
know<00:03:13.430> red<00:03:13.730> dot<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.150> kick<00:03:14.569> still<00:03:15.260> pretty<00:03:15.409> good

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
know red dot and kick still pretty good

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.619 
know red dot and kick still pretty good
