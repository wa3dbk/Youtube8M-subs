00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
about adding someone else in the same

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.910 
about adding someone else in the same
role<00:01:52.450> she<00:01:52.659> should<00:01:52.930> built<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.380> well<00:01:53.590> or<00:01:53.770> do<00:01:53.830> you

role she should built as well or do you
think<00:01:53.950> it'll<00:01:54.250> be<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.700> little<00:01:54.970> bit<00:01:55.060> more<00:01:55.300> maybe

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
think it'll be a little bit more maybe

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.330

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
been injured except at age 21 so I think

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.370 
been injured except at age 21 so I think
I've<00:04:53.760> had<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.090> good<00:04:54.240> life<00:04:54.300> leading<00:04:54.900> up<00:04:55.139> till

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
I've had a good life leading up till

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.580 
I've had a good life leading up till
then<00:04:56.000> injuries<00:04:57.000> come<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.270> mean<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.840> didn't

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
then injuries come I mean I didn't

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.290 
then injuries come I mean I didn't
expect<00:04:59.010> my<00:04:59.220> soccer<00:04:59.729> career<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.150> be

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
expect my soccer career to be

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.740 
expect my soccer career to be
injury-free<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.710> think<00:05:02.010> now<00:05:02.240> at<00:05:03.240> early<00:05:03.630> age

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
injury-free so I think now at early age

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.240 
injury-free so I think now at early age
it's<00:05:03.930> good<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.199> have<00:05:04.410> these<00:05:04.590> injuries<00:05:04.830> now<00:05:05.039> as

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
it's good to have these injuries now as

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.680 
it's good to have these injuries now as
opposed<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.820> later<00:05:06.030> in<00:05:06.150> my<00:05:06.240> career<00:05:06.300> so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
opposed to like later in my career so

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.180 
opposed to like later in my career so
yeah<00:05:06.900> it's<00:05:07.080> tough<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.440> battle<00:05:07.740> injuries

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
yeah it's tough to battle injuries

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.740 
yeah it's tough to battle injuries
because<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:08.970> still<00:05:09.150> want<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> practice<00:05:09.660> you

was<00:05:19.199> ready<00:05:19.410> against<00:05:19.770> Portland<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.430> think

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
was ready against Portland and I think

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.950 
was ready against Portland and I think
you<00:05:20.910> know<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.060> felt<00:05:21.270> great<00:05:21.449> after<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.720> game

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.589 
and I think I'll be ready for next game
so<00:05:24.860> how<00:05:25.860> is<00:05:26.099> it<00:05:26.310> felt<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.760> kind<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:26.940> settle<00:05:27.240> into

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
so how is it felt to kind of settle into

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.360 
so how is it felt to kind of settle into
the<00:05:27.750> left<00:05:28.260> back<00:05:28.440> position<00:05:28.650> because<00:05:29.190> in

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
the left back position because in

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.770 
the left back position because in
pre-season<00:05:29.729> at<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.120> beginning<00:05:30.389> of<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.630> year

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
pre-season at the beginning of the year

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.659 
pre-season at the beginning of the year
I<00:05:30.990> mean<00:05:31.320> yeah<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:31.800> mean<00:05:31.830> midfield<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.400> little<00:05:32.580> bit

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
I mean yeah I mean midfield a little bit

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:33.920 
I mean yeah I mean midfield a little bit
more<00:05:32.849> but<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.270> seems<00:05:33.539> like<00:05:33.660> he's<00:05:33.810> really

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
more but it it seems like he's really

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.589 
more but it it seems like he's really
kind<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.169> slaughter<00:05:34.470> them<00:05:34.680> now<00:05:34.860> too<00:05:34.919> though

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
kind of slaughter them now too though

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.500 
kind of slaughter them now too though
yeah<00:05:36.599> I<00:05:36.990> think<00:05:37.380> it's<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:38.039> mean<00:05:38.610> I'm<00:05:39.030> used<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.330> it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
yeah I think it's I mean I'm used to it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.939 
yeah I think it's I mean I'm used to it
it's<00:05:39.750> not<00:05:39.900> anything<00:05:40.110> really<00:05:40.410> no<00:05:40.620> I'm<00:05:40.740> used<00:05:40.919> to

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
it's not anything really no I'm used to

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.200 
it's not anything really no I'm used to
being<00:05:41.099> kind<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.370> thrown<00:05:41.580> all<00:05:41.789> over<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.000> place

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
being kind of thrown all over the place

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.279 
being kind of thrown all over the place
i<00:05:42.330> don't<00:05:42.449> think<00:05:42.599> i've<00:05:42.660> ever<00:05:42.690> been<00:05:42.900> comfortable

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
spirit has I guess developed using

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.070 
spirit has I guess developed using
professional<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.969> you<00:05:58.599> know<00:05:58.689> how<00:05:58.840> does<00:05:58.960> that

mean<00:05:59.199> be<00:05:59.289> translated<00:05:59.830> that<00:05:59.889> the<00:06:00.249> natural<00:06:00.639> um<00:06:01.270> I

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
mean be translated that the natural um I

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.719 
mean be translated that the natural um I
think<00:06:02.349> competing<00:06:03.099> is<00:06:03.310> one<00:06:03.460> thing<00:06:03.639> I've

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
think competing is one thing I've

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.519 
think competing is one thing I've
learned<00:06:03.759> you<00:06:04.479> know<00:06:04.659> this<00:06:04.990> league<00:06:05.169> is<00:06:05.289> really

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
learned you know this league is really

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.140 
learned you know this league is really
intense<00:06:05.830> anyone<00:06:06.279> can<00:06:06.430> really<00:06:06.639> win<00:06:06.759> any<00:06:06.909> game

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
intense anyone can really win any game

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.170 
intense anyone can really win any game
so<00:06:07.620> for<00:06:08.620> me<00:06:08.800> it's<00:06:08.979> developing<00:06:09.789> that<00:06:09.939> mentality

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
so for me it's developing that mentality

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.600 
so for me it's developing that mentality
to<00:06:10.539> kind<00:06:10.930> of<00:06:11.020> go<00:06:11.259> after<00:06:11.499> every<00:06:11.620> game<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:12.340> had

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
to kind of go after every game and had

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.070 
to kind of go after every game and had
that<00:06:12.789> mentality<00:06:12.879> laughs<00:06:13.360> throughout<00:06:13.599> all<00:06:13.779> 90

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
that mentality laughs throughout all 90

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.290 
that mentality laughs throughout all 90
minutes<00:06:14.319> so<00:06:14.529> for<00:06:15.460> me<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.580> think<00:06:15.639> it's<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.210> good

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
minutes so for me I think it's a good

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.179 
minutes so for me I think it's a good
platform<00:06:16.509> for<00:06:16.749> me<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.080> hopefully<00:06:17.650> be<00:06:17.979> called

yeah<00:06:55.779> what<00:06:56.050> do<00:06:56.289> you<00:06:56.319> think<00:06:56.379> are<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.589> keys<00:06:56.860> to<00:06:56.889> a

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
yeah what do you think are the keys to a

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.279 
yeah what do you think are the keys to a
spirit<00:06:57.460> victory<00:06:57.789> I<00:06:58.000> they<00:06:58.360> just<00:06:58.629> moving<00:06:59.199> the

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
spirit victory I they just moving the

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.890 
spirit victory I they just moving the
ball<00:06:59.409> I<00:06:59.469> mean<00:06:59.770> Kansas<00:07:00.189> plays<00:07:01.120> really<00:07:01.810> well

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
ball I mean Kansas plays really well

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.510 
ball I mean Kansas plays really well
together<00:07:02.169> their<00:07:02.589> possession<00:07:03.069> team<00:07:03.279> and<00:07:03.490> I

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
together their possession team and I

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.980 
together their possession team and I
think<00:07:03.729> they<00:07:03.849> move<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.089> ball<00:07:04.120> really<00:07:04.539> well<00:07:04.779> so

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
think they move the ball really well so

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.659 
think they move the ball really well so
for<00:07:05.169> us<00:07:05.199> it's<00:07:05.500> it's<00:07:05.860> kind<00:07:06.069> of<00:07:06.099> matching<00:07:06.490> their

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
for us it's it's kind of matching their

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.790 
for us it's it's kind of matching their
possession<00:07:07.180> and<00:07:07.419> hopefully<00:07:08.319> getting<00:07:08.529> into

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
possession and hopefully getting into

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.889 
possession and hopefully getting into
spaces<00:07:09.039> and<00:07:09.430> exposing<00:07:10.270> them<00:07:10.389> wherever<00:07:10.689> you

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:10.899 
spaces and exposing them wherever you

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:13.709 
spaces and exposing them wherever you
know<00:07:11.229> their<00:07:11.680> their<00:07:11.710> weekend<00:07:12.550> so<00:07:13.270> I<00:07:13.300> think<00:07:13.419> for

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719 
know their their weekend so I think for

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.119 
know their their weekend so I think for
us<00:07:13.930> it's<00:07:14.080> just<00:07:14.110> keeping<00:07:14.439> the<00:07:14.500> ball<00:07:14.620> moving<00:07:14.919> and

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:15.129 
us it's just keeping the ball moving and

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.950 
us it's just keeping the ball moving and
being<00:07:15.189> patient<00:07:15.460> there's<00:07:16.360> too<00:07:16.449> many<00:07:16.509> times<00:07:16.750> I

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
being patient there's too many times I

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.749 
being patient there's too many times I
think<00:07:17.020> we<00:07:17.289> kind<00:07:18.039> of<00:07:18.129> get<00:07:18.250> a<00:07:18.310> little<00:07:18.430> ahead<00:07:18.610> of

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
think we kind of get a little ahead of

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:20.850 
think we kind of get a little ahead of
ourselves<00:07:18.909> and<00:07:19.449> I<00:07:19.479> think<00:07:19.930> just<00:07:20.319> patience<00:07:20.770> is

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
ourselves and I think just patience is

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.250 
ourselves and I think just patience is
our<00:07:20.979> marquee<00:07:21.460> so<00:07:22.210> do<00:07:22.300> you<00:07:22.360> think<00:07:22.419> you<00:07:22.599> haven't
