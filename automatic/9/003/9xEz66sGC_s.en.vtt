00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.180
 the environment is to focus on web 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.270
 the premiere money 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.300
 I'm going to show you a very good program that is called 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.419
 dragon naturally I explained in 10 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.669
 this program 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.660
 the program 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.279
 has death 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.339
 you now and the computer do what you say 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.199
 for example says division 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 starts on April 7 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.979
 says my document says now my documents 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.090
 as for example there will be a program 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 com the notebook and other 27 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.470
 anything for example hello milestones in the notebook equity pola 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.110
 the program 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.480
 today nobody weighs around the rough heigth 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 on this page they found 390 megawatts much smaller and lighter 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 since they are only Spanish 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 and they are not 16 billion 20 or anything is four and worth it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 juste only enter 1 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 wait for 10 seconds 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.810
 the rays the friend denied will oppose me 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.850
 here they put the code download files 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.940
 in 45 seconds ileana normal load 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.610
 I do not do it because I already 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 all the assets I recommend that the opa in a folder create in the folder with the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.650
 name anyone for example swallowed pitinn naturals 10 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.530
 of an example 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.360
 and there are less than four files 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.580
 moon has saved unpacks just one 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 necessary compressed four decompress a single preferably the first 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.390
 and they will see how a file is going to come out 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 in format did and the serial 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 in her 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.600
 pity they charge lied with winds 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.719
 the one that is loading 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.559
 I called him in version 10 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.049
 because kiteni in the mbia crossing 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.049
 the one that I put the one of what is left 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.159
 Pakistan or four successes you will see that the one to compress I get this elusive 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.959
 you who are running it 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.659
 what you do is burn the exile on a disc 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.209
 with some program like 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.419
 January 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.209
 Cuéllar with 120 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.689
 the concert 20 that I found on the portable internet is left for you 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.549
 download it and you can burn the file 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.799
 once good malachi yes 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.059
 you are going to leave the disc 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.059
 and then put it back here is already the salt and the option to install 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.279
 the program 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.249
 have you do not install yi where the facilities are and when you 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.529
 ask for the 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.550
 the version 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.899
 point 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.209
 the version I do not remember what 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 you put the code that is here the serial 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.370
 and they have not just keep installing and they will have a program 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.759
 like this 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 gámez m 7 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.399
 initiate actor the spirit 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.759
 forgive that computer is so late but 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.499
 the border this page 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.499
 in the one next to the description of the video 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.819
 checki 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.819
 the system requirements come out 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.539
 to incidentally 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.769
 you need headphones approved by lorenz 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.989
 it is not necessary because I have 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.229
 microphone and all chimbo all old and it worked for me 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.969
 perfect 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.379
 when the perfect clear 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.379
 of an event 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.449
 the room was rita 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.449
 the bomb 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.770
 loading user files 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.249
 but all are while loading 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.650
 this is a munoz recommendation 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.380
 nothing happened to us and they are not necessary kessel thing that if you knew they speak to you 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.590
 language 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.169
 or you here 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.169
 memphis 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.169
 to turn on the microphone 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.219
 they adjust it well can not put into microphone 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.819
 right in front of his mouth but to the side 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.360
 but you can hear it and have a colom instance in a thumb 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.559
 now let's see and mass 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.680
 minimize 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.529
 the statement because it does not work but it works for me 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.129
 this investment the microphone 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 minimize 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.169
 Well the truth I do not know what is what is happening but 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.379
 but this serves 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.229
 you know how it is 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.639
 despite the afternoon hang unzip only one file 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.930
 and well it was already in the same folder 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.749
 then the iso file 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.460
 what a civilian sends 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.539
 with some show Mayan arch with 120 by the way the money 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.930
 nyse t receive them in the serial and this already have funk 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.210
 and in Spanish 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.729
 which will do all so much grace not the superior and semi-upper good 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:16.620
 comment 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.319
