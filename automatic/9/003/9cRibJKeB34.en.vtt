00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
to talk about HTML attributes because

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.660 
to talk about HTML attributes because
without<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.509> HTML<00:00:12.960> actually<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:14.160> will<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.490> be

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
without a HTML actually it will not be

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.180 
without a HTML actually it will not be
possible<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.509> create<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.809> website<00:00:16.049> link<00:00:16.470> using

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
possible to create a website link using

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
possible to create a website link using
HTML<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.720> let's<00:00:18.900> go<00:00:19.050> ahead<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.470> started

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
HTML so let's go ahead and get started

words right before the closing body tag

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
words right before the closing body tag
and<00:00:32.399> let's<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:33.000> ahead<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> start<00:00:33.510> writing<00:00:33.809> our

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and let's go ahead and start writing our

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.310 
and let's go ahead and start writing our
tag<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> website<00:00:35.850> link<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> start<00:00:37.170> off

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
tag for a website link so you start off

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
tag for a website link so you start off
by<00:00:37.350> writing<00:00:37.680> our<00:00:37.950> angle<00:00:38.280> bracket<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> then

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
by writing our angle bracket and then

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
by writing our angle bracket and then
the<00:00:39.300> letter<00:00:39.510> A<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.530> letter<00:00:40.559> A<00:00:40.829> stands<00:00:41.250> for

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the letter A and the letter A stands for

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
the letter A and the letter A stands for
anchor<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> type<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> tag<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
anchor and that's the type of tag that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
anchor and that's the type of tag that
we<00:00:43.559> would<00:00:43.710> use<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.579> create<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> website<00:00:45.149> wing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we would use to create a website wing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
we would use to create a website wing
but<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.219> ahead<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> hit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
but then we're gonna go ahead and hit

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
but then we're gonna go ahead and hit
the<00:00:47.879> spacebar<00:00:48.000> key<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.559> reason<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the spacebar key and the reason that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
the spacebar key and the reason that
we're<00:00:50.160> doing<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we're doing that is because we have to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're doing that is because we have to
write<00:00:51.750> an<00:00:52.100> HTML<00:00:53.100> attribute<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.170> an<00:00:55.170> HTML

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
write an HTML attribute and an HTML

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.479 
write an HTML attribute and an HTML
attribute<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> made<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> name<00:00:57.899> value<00:00:58.890> pairs

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
attribute is made up of name value pairs

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
attribute is made up of name value pairs
and<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.480> write<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> screen<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and I'm gonna write it on the screen to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
and I'm gonna write it on the screen to
show<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.059> syntax<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> basic

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
show you the syntax or the basic

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580 
show you the syntax or the basic
structure<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.119> name<00:01:06.119> value<00:01:06.150> pairs<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.080> HTML

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
structure of name value pairs for HTML

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.460 
structure of name value pairs for HTML
attributes<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.700> written<00:01:08.909> name<00:01:09.470> equals

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
attributes and it's written name equals

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.340 
attributes and it's written name equals
and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> value<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.270> quotes<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:13.200> gonna

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and then the value in quotes I'm gonna

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.700 
and then the value in quotes I'm gonna
say<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.680> again<00:01:13.799> name<00:01:14.600> equals<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
say that again name equals and then the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
say that again name equals and then the
value<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> quotes<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.540> case<00:01:18.810> our

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
value in quotes and in this case our

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.310 
value in quotes and in this case our
name<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.189> H<00:01:20.430> power<00:01:20.820> EF<00:01:21.320> which

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
name is going to be H power EF which

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
name is going to be H power EF which
stands<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.770> hyperlink<00:01:23.490> reference<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.180> then

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
stands for hyperlink reference and then

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
stands for hyperlink reference and then
we're<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> write<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> equal<00:01:25.830> sign<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
we're going to write the equal sign and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
we're going to write the equal sign and
then<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.180> quotes<00:01:27.479> we're<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.990> write<00:01:28.350> our

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then in quotes we're gonna write our

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.300 
then in quotes we're gonna write our
link<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.420> case<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:30.869> write<00:01:31.310> HTTP

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
link in this case we would write HTTP

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
link in this case we would write HTTP
colon<00:01:33.090> forward<00:01:33.450> slash<00:01:33.810> forward<00:01:34.200> slash<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
colon forward slash forward slash and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
colon forward slash forward slash and
then<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.759> write<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> domain<00:01:36.509> name<00:01:37.140> or

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
then we write the domain name or

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
then we write the domain name or
whatever<00:01:37.920> dot<00:01:38.520> part<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.000> domain<00:01:39.390> you're

value in quotes and then we're going to
write<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.049> angle<00:01:55.439> bracket<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:57.000> gonna

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
write an angle bracket and that's gonna

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990 
write an angle bracket and that's gonna
