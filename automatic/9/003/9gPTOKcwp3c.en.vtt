00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.433
 These Thangka, 

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:14.800
 Completed in central Tibet, around 1500 BC. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.667
 The main god, Mahakala, emanates from this halo of fire, 

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.600
 Like the devil of your worst nightmares. "Mahakala" in Buddhism means "Great Black" or "Black." 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.800
 Imagine walking around a dark temple with a candle, 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 And I saw parts of this god 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.867
 It emits dark. 

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:43.000
 He stands on the body revealing his claws, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.667
 Carrying a knife and a skull coated with blood. 

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.600
 It is surrounded by this crowd of devils 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.433
 Which is dancing 

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.667
 And its weapons are known 

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.233
 While devouring dogs, and wolves 

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.500
 And crows 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.433
 Meat of the dead. 

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:03.333
 The sight of all these distinguished monks takes me 

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.700
 Sitting on the sides. 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 The texts tell us 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.200
 That student who does not respect the Buddha 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 The Mahakala will eat it alive. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.667
 He is the guardian of the temple and Buddhist teachings, 

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:20.467
 He is capable of destroying the consequences that prevent the attainment of enlightenment, the desires inherent in us 

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.900
 And the emotions that bind us to this world: greed and lust, 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.734
 Especially pride. 

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:35.133
 The idea of ​​getting rid of pride is tied to the cutting off of these heads. 

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.834
 It is almost the real size, 

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.834
 Its strong impact is precisely its size. 

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:47.133
 There is a picture lined behind that core 

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.500
 They are relatively correct; 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.934
 If the building of the thang is not suitable for the tanga, it will cause psychological damage to the meditator. 

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.567
 In other words, the idea is given to this world 

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.000
 Beyond our understanding of the real scope. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.300
 It does not attract my attention and attracts me to a virtual reality and, 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.199
 But on subjects I find extremely dangerous. 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.867
 This tension or gravity is a great grandfather. 

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:18.734
 You look in his eyes, 

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.133
 And if his aggression you face 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.600
 Which awakens all the feelings of anxiety and fear. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 But at the same time, there is reassurance 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.334
 And that it is with this arrogance will be beside you. 

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:34.600
 He is a fierce ally. That feeling of awe or that feeling 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.667
 Anonymous gives him a great attraction and meaning.
