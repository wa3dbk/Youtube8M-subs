cardiovascular<00:00:57.960> system<00:00:58.969> now<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.449> start<00:01:00.840> off

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
cardiovascular system now we start off

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
cardiovascular system now we start off
with<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> fully<00:01:01.829> labeled<00:01:02.430> heart<00:01:02.760> diagram<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
with a fully labeled heart diagram the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.510 
least one or two questions on the senses
so<00:02:06.030> most<00:02:06.270> likely<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> eye<00:02:07.829> or

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so most likely it will be on the eye or

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180 
so most likely it will be on the eye or
the<00:02:08.580> ear<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> diagram<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:11.129> the
