00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
2003 we're going to do the mass air flow

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.109 
2003 we're going to do the mass air flow
sensor<00:00:08.419> change<00:00:09.200> it<00:00:09.349> out<00:00:09.549> had<00:00:10.549> a<00:00:10.579> problem<00:00:10.879> with

road and hooked up a scanner and it came
up<00:00:17.509> with<00:00:17.660> code<00:00:19.210> p0<00:00:20.210> 100<00:00:20.900> which<00:00:21.080> is<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:21.470> mass

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
up with code p0 100 which is the mass

up with code p0 100 which is the mass
airflow<00:00:21.949> code<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:22.939> I<00:00:23.720> cleaned<00:00:24.199> it<00:00:24.550> it<00:00:25.550> lasted

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
airflow code and I cleaned it it lasted
