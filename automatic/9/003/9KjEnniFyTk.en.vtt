00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
automatic sugarcane farm now the reason

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.180 
automatic sugarcane farm now the reason
we're<00:00:12.450> looking<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.110> because<00:00:13.469> AFK

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
we're looking at this is because AFK

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.250 
we're looking at this is because AFK
streams<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.670> recently<00:00:15.089> become<00:00:15.299> much<00:00:15.780> easier

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
streams have recently become much easier

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.570 
streams have recently become much easier
to<00:00:16.410> build<00:00:16.590> whereas<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> used<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to build whereas you used to have to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.640 
to build whereas you used to have to
build<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.000> massive<00:00:18.570> long<00:00:18.930> stream<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> water

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
build a massive long stream of water

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
build a massive long stream of water
transporting<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.580> items<00:00:20.910> outside<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
transporting your items outside of the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.779 
transporting your items outside of the
loaded<00:00:21.869> chunks<00:00:22.170> now<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.220> fire<00:00:23.460> all

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
loaded chunks now you can just fire all

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.179 
loaded chunks now you can just fire all
of<00:00:23.820> your<00:00:24.090> items<00:00:24.510> through<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> portal<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> they

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
of your items through a portal and they

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.679 
of your items through a portal and they
will<00:00:26.369> stay<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> other<00:00:27.150> side<00:00:27.449> completely

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
will stay on the other side completely

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.859 
will stay on the other side completely
unloaded<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.220> will<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.789> de-spawn<00:00:30.390> so

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
unloaded and they will not de-spawn so

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.030 
unloaded and they will not de-spawn so
that<00:00:30.990> means<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.740> keep<00:00:31.890> this

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that means that you can just keep this

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.760 
that means that you can just keep this
loaded<00:00:32.430> 24/7<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.660> always<00:00:33.899> harvest<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
loaded 24/7 it will always harvest and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380 
loaded 24/7 it will always harvest and
your<00:00:35.100> items<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:35.940> through<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
your items will just go through the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
your items will just go through the
portal<00:00:36.750> stay<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> pick

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
portal stay there and then you can pick

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
portal stay there and then you can pick
them<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.020> my

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
them up when you want to now in my

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
them up when you want to now in my
opinion<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:41.100> sounds<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> pretty<00:00:41.910> good

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
opinion that sounds like a pretty good

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
opinion that sounds like a pretty good
deal<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> might<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:43.920> quickly<00:00:44.550> show

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
deal now I might as well quickly show

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
deal now I might as well quickly show
you<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.210> action<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.320> see

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you this in action so as you can see

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
you this in action so as you can see
here<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:47.160> our<00:00:47.190> sugar<00:00:47.520> cane<00:00:47.789> grows<00:00:48.120> this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
here when our sugar cane grows this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
here when our sugar cane grows this
piston<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.170> extend<00:00:49.200> pushing<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.160> sugar

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
piston will extend pushing off the sugar

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
piston will extend pushing off the sugar
cane<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.390> travel<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.930> our

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
cane which will then travel down our

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
cane which will then travel down our
water<00:00:52.350> stream<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.550> trigger<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
water stream that will then trigger this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.970 
water stream that will then trigger this
tripwire<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.289> reset<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
tripwire here which will reset all of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
tripwire here which will reset all of
our<00:00:56.190> pistons<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.699> also<00:00:57.420> push<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> ones

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
our pistons and also push out the ones

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
our pistons and also push out the ones
beneath<00:00:58.620> taking<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.280> any<00:00:59.550> remaining

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
beneath taking out any remaining

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
beneath taking out any remaining
sugarcane<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.460> simple

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sugarcane now this is a very simple

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
sugarcane now this is a very simple
design<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> Redstone

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
design as you can see the Redstone

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
design as you can see the Redstone
behind<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.189> pretty<00:01:05.549> minimal<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.330> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
behind it is pretty minimal and it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 
behind it is pretty minimal and it's
very<00:01:06.750> easy<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.170> build<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.890> straight

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
very easy to build so let's get straight

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670 
very easy to build so let's get straight
on<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.729> tutorial<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.470> before<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.560> get

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
on with this tutorial now before we get

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
on with this tutorial now before we get
on<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> tutorial<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> guys

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on with a tutorial that I want you guys

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
on with a tutorial that I want you guys
to<00:01:12.270> understand<00:01:12.960> something<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to understand something this here is a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
to understand something this here is a
budded<00:01:14.909> piston<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.900> cause<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.560> block

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
budded piston when we cause it a block

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
budded piston when we cause it a block
update<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.610> extend<00:01:17.970> outwards<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
update it will extend outwards now that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
update it will extend outwards now that
is<00:01:18.930> pretty<00:01:19.110> much<00:01:19.290> while<00:01:19.619> sugarcane<00:01:20.130> does<00:01:20.340> over

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
is pretty much while sugarcane does over

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
is pretty much while sugarcane does over
here<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> sugar<00:01:21.509> cane<00:01:21.750> grows<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.170> front

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
here when the sugar cane grows in front

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
here when the sugar cane grows in front
of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> piston<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.340> cause<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> block

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of the piston it will cause it a block

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.160 
of the piston it will cause it a block
updates<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> piston<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.140> extend

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
updates and then the piston will extend

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
updates and then the piston will extend
now<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.430> tripwire<00:01:26.970> back<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.450> will<00:01:27.630> then

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
now this tripwire back here will then

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
now this tripwire back here will then
turn<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.619> line<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> redstone<00:01:29.130> here

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
turn off this line of redstone here

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
turn off this line of redstone here
which<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.360> allowing<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> happen<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
which is allowing that to happen and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
which is allowing that to happen and
then<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.790> line<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> redstone<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:34.079> here

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
then this line of redstone back here

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
then this line of redstone back here
will<00:01:34.979> cause<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> update<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
will cause it the update to make it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510 
will cause it the update to make it
retract<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.680> fairly<00:01:38.100> simple

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
retract now it is all fairly simple

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.670 
retract now it is all fairly simple
redstone<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.020> wanted<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> explain

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
redstone but I just wanted to explain

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
redstone but I just wanted to explain
that<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> guys<00:01:41.420> now<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> start

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that to you guys now you want to start

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
that to you guys now you want to start
things<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.070> bog-standard

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
things off with just your bog-standard

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
things off with just your bog-standard
water<00:01:45.119> stream<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.799> quite<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
water stream now if you do have quite a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.590 
water stream now if you do have quite a
lot<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> resources<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.180> heavily

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
lot of resources then I would heavily

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
lot of resources then I would heavily
suggest<00:01:48.960> putting<00:01:49.140> ice<00:01:49.409> underneath<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
suggest putting ice underneath this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
suggest putting ice underneath this
water<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.210> items<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.810> transported

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
water so your items are transported

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
water so your items are transported
faster<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.640> generally<00:01:53.939> speed<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
faster which will generally speed up the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
faster which will generally speed up the
process<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.710> harvesting<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
process of the harvesting but if you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.800 
process of the harvesting but if you
don't<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> thing<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.630> it's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
don't have that kind of thing then it's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.740 
don't have that kind of thing then it's
fine<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.380> works<00:01:58.799> without<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fine it works without it so then you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
fine it works without it so then you
just<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.110> make<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.500> wall<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> pistons

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
just want to make your wall of pistons

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.030 
just want to make your wall of pistons
like<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.450> will<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
like this now this will just be a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.010 
like this now this will just be a
three-high<00:02:05.040> wall<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:06.119> third<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.689> will<00:02:06.869> be

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
three-high wall one third of it will be

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
three-high wall one third of it will be
your<00:02:07.229> standard<00:02:07.619> wall<00:02:07.829> blocks<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
your standard wall blocks and then the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.930 
your standard wall blocks and then the
upper<00:02:09.450> 2/3<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:11.009> regular<00:02:11.250> pistons

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
upper 2/3 will be your regular pistons

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
upper 2/3 will be your regular pistons
like<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
like this and then you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
like this and then you
sugar<00:02:13.440> cane<00:02:13.709> will<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.159> along<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> bottom<00:02:14.970> down

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
sugar cane will go along the bottom down

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.860 
sugar cane will go along the bottom down
here<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> run<00:02:18.540> blocks

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
here so then you just want to run blocks

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.160 
here so then you just want to run blocks
across<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.709> part<00:02:20.099> here<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.989> diagonal<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
across this part here just diagonal to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.110 
across this part here just diagonal to
your<00:02:22.290> upper<00:02:22.470> Pistons<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:23.580> blow<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.879> all

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
your upper Pistons and then blow it all

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
your upper Pistons and then blow it all
the<00:02:24.239> way<00:02:24.330> along<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.230> well<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.099> we're

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the way along here as well and we're

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.770 
the way along here as well and we're
going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> add<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:26.790> our<00:02:26.879> trip<00:02:27.239> lines<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.659> want

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
going to add in our trip lines you want

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.210 
going to add in our trip lines you want
to<00:02:27.840> place<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.019> block<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:28.950> block

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to place a block there and they block

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.150 
to place a block there and they block
there<00:02:29.519> with<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.090> tripwire<00:02:30.750> hook<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.560> here

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
there with a tripwire hook here and here

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.259 
there with a tripwire hook here and here
then<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.459> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.670> take<00:02:32.879> out<00:02:33.030> these<00:02:33.209> three

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
then you want to take out these three

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.210 
then you want to take out these three
blocks<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.140> place<00:02:34.680> redstone<00:02:35.190> along

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
blocks like this place redstone along

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.059 
blocks like this place redstone along
the<00:02:35.549> bottom<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.870> piece<00:02:37.379> of<00:02:37.590> string<00:02:37.860> up

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the bottom and then a piece of string up

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.800 
the bottom and then a piece of string up
here<00:02:38.370> now<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.879> allow<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.390> connect

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
here now that will allow it to connect

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.420 
here now that will allow it to connect
then<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.650> take<00:02:40.829> out<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.099> rest<00:02:41.280> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
then you can just take out the rest of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.940 
then you can just take out the rest of
this<00:02:41.489> redstone<00:02:41.849> here<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> want<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.829> grab

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
this redstone here now you want to grab

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.410 
this redstone here now you want to grab
some<00:02:44.250> redstone<00:02:44.459> dust<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.060> place<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.390> like

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
some redstone dust and place it like

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.960 
some redstone dust and place it like
that<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.959> he<00:02:46.019> broke<00:02:46.319> up<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.069> redstone

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that and he broke up like so redstone

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.530 
that and he broke up like so redstone
torch<00:02:48.329> block<00:02:49.079> torch<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> block<00:02:51.269> on

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
torch block torch and then a block on

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.539 
torch block torch and then a block on
top<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.989> redstone<00:02:52.739> torch<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> side

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
top like that redstone torch on the side

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.150 
top like that redstone torch on the side
there<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:54.120> repeater<00:02:54.629> sedative<00:02:55.319> for<00:02:55.560> ticks<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
there a repeater sedative for ticks and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.190 
there a repeater sedative for ticks and
then<00:02:56.579> just<00:02:56.790> run<00:02:57.000> your<00:02:57.120> redstone<00:02:57.359> out<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
then just run your redstone out to the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.830 
then just run your redstone out to the
other<00:02:58.379> end<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.250> then<00:02:59.940> grab<00:03:00.299> some<00:03:00.329> blocks

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
other end like so then grab some blocks

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.569 
other end like so then grab some blocks
and<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.170> put<00:03:01.349> them<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:01.980> another

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
and just put them out like this another

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.180 
and just put them out like this another
torch<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:03.930> your<00:03:04.109> redstone<00:03:04.349> out<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
torch here and then your redstone out to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
torch here and then your redstone out to
the<00:03:05.310> end<00:03:05.519> once<00:03:05.940> again<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.569> then<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> are<00:03:06.930> done

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the end once again and then you are done

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.470 
the end once again and then you are done
for<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> redstone<00:03:07.980> side<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.430> things<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.239> as

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
for the redstone side of things so as

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.180 
for the redstone side of things so as
you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:09.900> when<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.260> tree<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.739> trip<00:03:11.010> line

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
you can see when we tree this trip line

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.220 
you can see when we tree this trip line
it<00:03:11.579> will<00:03:11.730> reset<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.480> our<00:03:12.599> pistons<00:03:13.079> they

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
it will reset all of our pistons they

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.110 
it will reset all of our pistons they
will<00:03:13.379> all<00:03:13.530> retract<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.400> when<00:03:14.609> we<00:03:14.730> cause<00:03:14.970> an

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
will all retract then when we cause an

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.210 
will all retract then when we cause an
update<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.810> upper<00:03:16.170> one<00:03:16.349> as<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.069> see

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
update to this upper one as you can see

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.530 
update to this upper one as you can see
that<00:03:18.000> extends<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.680> good<00:03:20.480> now<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that extends and it's all good now the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.089 
that extends and it's all good now the
last<00:03:21.780> thing<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.230> want<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.859> just

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
last thing that you want to do is just

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.949 
last thing that you want to do is just
grab<00:03:23.250> some<00:03:23.609> iron<00:03:23.940> bars<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.419> run<00:03:24.569> them<00:03:24.720> across

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
grab some iron bars and run them across

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.870 
grab some iron bars and run them across
like<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.500> prevent<00:03:25.829> your<00:03:26.010> items<00:03:26.430> flying

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
like this to prevent your items flying

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
like this to prevent your items flying
outwards<00:03:27.450> like<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.169> then<00:03:28.590> also<00:03:28.769> cover

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
outwards like that and then also cover

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.949 
outwards like that and then also cover
up<00:03:29.489> any<00:03:29.760> holes<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.299> you've<00:03:30.419> got<00:03:30.660> because

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
up any holes that you've got because

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.449 
up any holes that you've got because
there<00:03:31.169> is<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.319> potential<00:03:31.829> for<00:03:31.859> your<00:03:32.069> shoot<00:03:32.250> came

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
there is a potential for your shoot came

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.860 
there is a potential for your shoot came
to<00:03:32.609> fly<00:03:32.849> out<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.060> those<00:03:33.329> as<00:03:33.510> well

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
to fly out of those as well

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.569 
to fly out of those as well
but<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:34.349> we<00:03:34.410> are<00:03:34.560> done<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:34.919> if<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.459> play

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
but now we are done so if you just play

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.190 
but now we are done so if you just play
some<00:03:35.760> fruit<00:03:35.970> came<00:03:36.180> down<00:03:36.359> here<00:03:36.569> as<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:37.049> can<00:03:37.079> see

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
some fruit came down here as you can see

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.960 
some fruit came down here as you can see
you<00:03:37.440> guys<00:03:37.590> harvested<00:03:38.130> outwards<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.639> then

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
you guys harvested outwards and then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.699 
you guys harvested outwards and then
dropped<00:03:39.299> into<00:03:39.510> our<00:03:39.630> stream<00:03:40.019> now<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.230> don't<00:03:40.560> have

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
dropped into our stream now I don't have

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.379 
dropped into our stream now I don't have
any<00:03:40.829> ice<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.579> as<00:03:41.669> you<00:03:41.819> can<00:03:41.970> see<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
any ice in there and as you can see is

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.170 
any ice in there and as you can see is
incredibly<00:03:43.260> slow<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:43.919> like<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.310> said<00:03:44.370> having

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
incredibly slow so like I said having

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.569 
incredibly slow so like I said having
some<00:03:45.480> ice<00:03:45.690> would<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.290> help<00:03:46.560> with<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
some ice would really help with the

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.750 
some ice would really help with the
speed<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.239> operation<00:03:49.099> now<00:03:50.099> before<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.579> go

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
speed of the operation now before we go

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.550 
speed of the operation now before we go
I<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.150> say<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.359> massive<00:03:51.720> thank<00:03:52.169> you<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.349> the
