00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
clear and this right here is the water

clear and this right here is the water
system<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.529> goes<00:00:16.859> underneath<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.970> design

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
system that goes underneath my design

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.800 
system that goes underneath my design
for<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> mob<00:00:19.109> spawner<00:00:19.910> all<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
for the mob spawner all right what you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.290 
for the mob spawner all right what you
see<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.740> main<00:00:22.949> channel<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.609> way

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
see here is that the main channel a way

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
see here is that the main channel a way
that<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> channels<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> mobs<00:00:26.250> after<00:00:26.699> they've

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that the channels the mobs after they've

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.930 
that the channels the mobs after they've
fallen<00:00:27.119> through<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.250> caddy<00:00:30.140> whatever<00:00:31.140> called

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
fallen through the caddy whatever called

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.100 
fallen through the caddy whatever called
whatever<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.210> called<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.840> things

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
whatever these are called these things

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.299 
whatever these are called these things
here<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> look<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here so the way you look at this is the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.200 
here so the way you look at this is the
main<00:00:39.210> spawning<00:00:40.020> area<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.340> at

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
main spawning area would be over here at

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
main spawning area would be over here at
the<00:00:42.480> level<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> level<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:44.010> two

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the level at the level of these two

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
the level at the level of these two
rings<00:00:44.579> okay<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.800> example<00:00:47.280> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
rings okay and in this example this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360 
rings okay and in this example this
would<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> left<00:00:48.450> hand<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
would be the left hand side and this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
would be the left hand side and this
entire<00:00:50.520> structure<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.719> mirrored<00:00:52.199> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
entire structure would be mirrored on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
entire structure would be mirrored on
that<00:00:52.949> side<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:56.250> course<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.640> entire

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that side and of course this entire

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
that side and of course this entire
thing<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.480> enclosed<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.800> keep<00:00:59.340> some

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
thing would be enclosed to keep some

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
thing would be enclosed to keep some
light<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.879> whatever<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.770> probably<00:01:01.770> be

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
light out and whatever and probably be

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
light out and whatever and probably be
underground<00:01:02.460> unless<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.059> did<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
underground unless you did it up in the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.550 
underground unless you did it up in the
sky<00:01:05.390> these<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.630> rings<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.530> there

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
sky these two rings the one right there

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
sky these two rings the one right there
and<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.729> right<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.060> represent<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and that one right there represent the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
and that one right there represent the
location<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.619> two<00:01:10.830> channels<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.729> two

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
location of the two channels or two

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
location of the two channels or two
columns<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> Imams<00:01:13.799> drop<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
columns that the Imams drop down and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.320 
columns that the Imams drop down and
through<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
through so right here as you can see it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.679 
through so right here as you can see it
doesn't<00:01:18.600> quite<00:01:18.780> end<00:01:19.220> close<00:01:20.220> enough<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.700> two

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
doesn't quite end close enough it's two

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.870 
doesn't quite end close enough it's two
off<00:01:21.900> i<00:01:22.080> believe<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.090> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
off i believe so it's right there and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.249 
off i believe so it's right there and
you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.000> each<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.540> goes<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you know as each one goes down it's just

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.719 
you know as each one goes down it's just
dropping<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.829> level<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.220> another<00:01:29.490> source

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
dropping one level and another source

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.410 
dropping one level and another source
power<00:01:30.299> source<00:01:30.600> blocks<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:35.420> then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
power source blocks right there and then

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
power source blocks right there and then
decide<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> turn<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> source

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
decide make the turn here so the source

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
decide make the turn here so the source
blocks<00:01:38.700> end<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.530> new<00:01:40.710> source

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
blocks end there and then to new source

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
blocks end there and then to new source
blocks<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> direction<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:44.869> if<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
blocks going that direction and if you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
blocks going that direction and if you
imagine<00:01:46.170> over<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.829> would<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> other

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
imagine over here would be the other

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.789 
imagine over here would be the other
side<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.479> exactly<00:01:48.780> mirrored<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> side

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
side so exactly mirrored on this side

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.760 
side so exactly mirrored on this side
here<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.399> comes<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
here so it comes up through here and the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.469 
here so it comes up through here and the
way<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.070> combines<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> drop

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
way these combines is you have a drop

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
way these combines is you have a drop
down<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:55.979> only<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
down right there and you only have a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
down right there and you only have a
source<00:01:57.060> block<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.439> right<00:01:58.520> there

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
source block right there and right there

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.969 
source block right there and right there
and<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.810> gives<00:02:00.990> us<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> advantage<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and this gives us the advantage of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.920 
and this gives us the advantage of
anything<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:02.610> dropped<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.180> gets

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
anything that's dropped in there gets

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
anything that's dropped in there gets
pushed<00:02:04.170> along<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> any<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.380> any<00:02:07.950> mobs

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
pushed along so any kind of any mobs

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.450 
pushed along so any kind of any mobs
that<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.580> stuck<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.060> thing<00:02:09.330> work

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
that get stuck in this thing work

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.460 
that get stuck in this thing work
so<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.000> works<00:02:11.150> pretty<00:02:11.210> good<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.470> coming

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
so it works pretty good and coming
