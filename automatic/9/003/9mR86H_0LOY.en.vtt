00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.140
 crucians for wintering accumulate in large 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.810
 groups 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.810
 and the size of individuals is about the same 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.720
 in this case, crucians were the size of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.720
 300 grams to 1 kilogram of weight 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.320
 like carp they create around them 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.840
 clouds of solid flour therefore unfortunately 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.140
 the camera can not always shoot 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.140
 their total number 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.080
 this time, visually in the frame flash 12 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.410
 karasika really I dived next to a ton 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.410
 fish 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.270
 they have chosen to park a small pit 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 up to eight meters deep with an oozy bottom 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.580
 and by the clay edges, by the way, neighboring me 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.510
 we are completely identical 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.510
 and similar to this were completely empty 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.100
 I've watched real a few times 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.170
 but could not understand why 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.590
 This pit was chosen for themselves to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 Russia
