00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.150
 I will reveal another little secret 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.550
 using the buzz this is a bit 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.200
 loath to tell you though if you 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.380
 you promise 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.560
 because out of stock the fish of 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.140
 let me explain a little secret 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.630
 only emergency spinning and those 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.540
 great we say those very red ones 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.420
 small victories 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.270
 how many times has it happened that tuna 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.890
 he ate on very small things when 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.320
 the tone eats up very little things and 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.390
 makes eating very very scattered 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.239
 so a jump here a jump over there 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.760
 maybe we are all day later 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.590
 to chase them with the boat and not 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.780
 we never get to central because every 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.700
 once he eats it he would be informed 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.430
 have too much to eat have failed 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.560
 to close the tones eat around the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.350
 boat maybe in the distance of 100 200 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.700
 300 meters and you can't get to them 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.280
 above because as soon as you arrive 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.619
 close enough to sink eat 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.630
 on the small so they don't like things 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.310
 very voluminous so we have 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.670
 difficulty throwing them with canes that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.869
 have 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.850
 max a grade of 7 10 15 20 kg depending on 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.490
 as a slave we move to read 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.220
 heavier here what the problem is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.630
 being able to get to make throws from 70 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.770
 80 meters stay away from the small 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 lack without sinking the tones is 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.170
 but being able to launch the fargli 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.460
 eat small things 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.750
 so I think we made ourselves up 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.110
 let's reuse a tool that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.509
 those who follow me for a while surely know that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.250
 I prefer is that I love that it is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.130
 the slow pitch in this case we have one 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.929
 80 gram slow pitch can be 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.819
 the accent I don't overdo that anyway 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.600
 the canes overload them but not 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.399
 exaggerate 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.039
 so we have exaggerated cast due 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.690
 at the slow vc because 80 100 grams there 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.269
 they do make us do good work 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.220
 cane and make us do a nice throw though 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.580
 obviously only on PC and I have tried e 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.290
 you will see it also eat us often 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.109
 armed with a double dacron in this 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.910
 fashion with a single hook we are 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.890
 calm and sure we attack it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.910
 slow pitch and under the snoopy what 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.109
 let's make 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.579
 we have 11 written ringers now this 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.769
 moment away so much did you understand more or 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:38.930
 less how a piece of 0 60 works 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:41.950
 0 70 0 80 on which we will buy a solid 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.890
 this is the split that below del 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.200
 the slow pitch is a piece like that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.480
 that we have used previously and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.660
 in this case I rick nice reshuffle 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.840
 straight and stiff 16 gen this is a sj 41 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.910
 16 45 a check of 54 anyway a hook 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.130
 with a nice thread this are friends yes 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.650
 they use very tough gala in chico 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.989
 these little ones not 30 to let you see a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.260
 depending on the size of the tones you will change 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.110
 a little you the story more or less the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.910
 bases then of course it makes me happy if and 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 volver e te the technique and if you send me 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.069
 messages or videos to show me that 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.209
 what have you done on this we take 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.209
 a prominent liter ron 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.739
 we simply do this village this year 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.950
 you will see the tuna will obviously eat in 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.050
 this way also the verse was made 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.870
 of the tuna honestly the indicator i 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:46.330
 tam animals and we will have ours we will have the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.700
 our catch will eat on the small e 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.650
 soft we will recover low by doing 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.140
 small look for it slow pitch and you will see 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.489
 which recovered quickly by spini 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.340
 then like claws on emergencies 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.900
 that not with some look for but not 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.299
 concern we will recover that they have why 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.890
 otherwise it will go down or fall because 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.440
 you often know that tuna when you have it 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.250
 eaten is already a little more concentrated 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.900
 gladly eats in fall or in 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.799
 escaping, that is, recovering fast giving 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.299
 some look tina you will see that 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.100
 will gladly eat on the very small 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.410
 then on a seven- pound nag 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.330
 the spare tail obviously not not 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.850
 we're going to put the head where the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.610
 head a 10 range fuck me yes 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.150
 straighten in an instant 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.340
 this is another very very solution 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 let's say we invented ourselves and a lot 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.140
 very creative but I assure you that it does 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.650
 really eat the very very tone 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.150
 much more because you won't see it with 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.120
 images in water compared to others 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.770
 tires with one movement that completely 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.889
 different we tried with many others 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.129
 tires 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.979
 I do not want to do negative publicity 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.349
 other to other companies, however, the buzz 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.259
 note that they can be practically diversified 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.779
 very different without lead will come back 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.120
 at the slow pitch the slow pitch will do the same 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.909
 basically a paint stick there 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.460
 he will come back but you will see that they will eat 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.099
 this has happened more than once 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.620
 unfortunately the camera on board is not 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.469
 happened more than once I took 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.020
 from the frenzy and two tuna ate 1 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.270
 on the pcie slot and one on the drone the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.419
 result was obviously the break 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.569
 because we were fishing with 10 60 of a terminal 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.740
 with a 50 pound track 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.430
 unfortunately we have not lost it 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.529
 PCI slot because you are it seems to me it is 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.240
 broken this allows the terminal 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.430
 between the buzz the PCI slot that puts a 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.839
 in a bit more subtle for a matter more 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.550
 and I don't want to lose the home duo 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.819
 fundamentally saic money we are at 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.819
 Genoese
