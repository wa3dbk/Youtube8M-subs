00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.650 

secrets<00:00:26.370> be<00:00:28.070> amazing<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.370> are<00:00:29.660> actually

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
secrets be amazing so we are actually

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
secrets be amazing so we are actually
able<00:00:31.290> to<00:00:31.500> access<00:00:31.860> spring<00:00:32.250> water<00:00:32.490> here<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
able to access spring water here at the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.730 
able to access spring water here at the
beach<00:00:33.060> for<00:00:33.330> a<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.570> interesting<00:00:34.170> reason<00:00:34.560> and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
beach for a very interesting reason and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.040 
beach for a very interesting reason and
that<00:00:34.920> reason<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.750> Hawaiian

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that reason is is that the Hawaiian

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
that reason is is that the Hawaiian
Islands<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.530> they<00:00:37.620> came<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.809> basically

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
Islands when they came up basically

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.130 
Islands when they came up basically
accumulate<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.800> lens<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:42.059> fresh<00:00:42.660> spring<00:00:43.110> water

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
accumulate a lens of fresh spring water

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.729 
accumulate a lens of fresh spring water
that's<00:00:43.950> pulled<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.150> meniscus<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.590> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that's pulled up like a meniscus but in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.290 
that's pulled up like a meniscus but in
Reverse<00:00:47.040> normally<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.790> when<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.180> have

Reverse normally when you when you have

Reverse normally when you when you have
a<00:00:48.360> couple<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.720> water<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.800> bit

a couple of water there's a little bit
of<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.400> concavity<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.260> top

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
of a concavity of the water at the top

of<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.339> water<00:00:53.580> level<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.410> mountains

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
of the water level well in the mountains

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.619 
of the water level well in the mountains
it's<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.790> opposite<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.600> around

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it's actually the opposite way around

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's actually the opposite way around
and<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:58.949> ocean<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.820> these

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and in the ocean out here on these

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
and in the ocean out here on these
islands<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> opposite<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.350> around<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
islands it's the opposite way around it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
islands it's the opposite way around it
seemed<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.400> it's<00:01:02.640> been<00:01:02.790> pulled<00:01:03.239> up

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
seemed it's because it's been pulled up

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
seemed it's because it's been pulled up
into<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.500> mountains<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.760> North

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
into the mountains and on the North

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.970 
into the mountains and on the North
Shore<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:07.020> islands<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.650> Hawaii

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
Shore of these islands like in Hawaii

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.820 
Shore of these islands like in Hawaii
here<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.880> mountains<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.330> been<00:01:09.390> sheared<00:01:10.080> by

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
here the mountains have been sheared by

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
here the mountains have been sheared by
the<00:01:10.860> tidal<00:01:11.730> flow<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.480> that's<00:01:12.659> happened

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the tidal flow and that that's happened

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
the tidal flow and that that's happened
over<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.350> period<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.800> hundreds<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.550> thousands

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
over a period of hundreds of thousands

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.610 
over a period of hundreds of thousands
or<00:01:15.000> millions<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.420> years<00:01:15.510> or<00:01:15.720> whatever<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> so

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
or millions of years or whatever and so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.320 
or millions of years or whatever and so
as<00:01:16.800> we<00:01:17.010> go<00:01:17.130> further<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.670> further<00:01:17.850> north

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
as we go further and further north

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
as we go further and further north
around<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> northwest<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.970> ends

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
around to the northwest here what ends

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
around to the northwest here what ends
up<00:01:21.180> happening<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.320> more<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.710> more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
up happening is you get more and more

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
up happening is you get more and more
spring<00:01:23.310> water<00:01:23.520> activity<00:01:24.000> because<00:01:24.300> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
spring water activity because that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
spring water activity because that
mountain<00:01:25.410> has<00:01:25.830> been<00:01:26.070> sheared<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
mountain has been sheared so the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
mountain has been sheared so the
meniscus<00:01:27.660> has<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.260> cut<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
meniscus has been actually cut into and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.240 
meniscus has been actually cut into and
the<00:01:30.060> water<00:01:30.420> bleeds<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.890> gives<00:01:32.070> us

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the water bleeds out and that gives us

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.400 
the water bleeds out and that gives us
access<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.910> situation<00:01:33.480> like<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.810> with

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
access to a situation like this with

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.350 
access to a situation like this with
spring<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.160> just<00:01:35.460> literally<00:01:35.880> coming<00:01:36.090> right

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
spring water just literally coming right

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
spring water just literally coming right
out<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> side<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> cliff<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.970> is
