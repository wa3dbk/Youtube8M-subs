 hi here I am again and now 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.350
 we left the tamales for two hours and 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.130
 half 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.830
 and now we're going to have already taken one out and 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.960
 I'm going to show you how it was 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.960
 the water runs a little 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:32.360
 of aluminum we are going to put on the plate 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.879
 Be careful because it's hot I want to 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.180
 say that these tamales is a meal 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:42.230
 very typical of colombia and they do it in 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.620
 several parts of the country and it's also a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.290
 of the meals that remind me of my 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.839
 mom and she did it always more than 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.640
 everything for Christmas and because it's a meal 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.769
 that much more is done than everything in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.960
 Christmas and although it is not Christmas 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.809
 It can also be done in any 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.940
 time another thing is that I 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.479
 He remembers my mom a lot like she does 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.380

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.289

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.420

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 and bacon or pork rind as they call him and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.890
 He said they were souls from this one. 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
