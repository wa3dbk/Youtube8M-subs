00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello how are you good in this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.570
 opportunity I will indicate exercises 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.490
 basic and advanced for people who 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.870
 They are overweight and what they want to lose 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.059
 of weight quickly 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 to start the person who has 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.279
 overweight usually have tendencies 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.770
 sedentary this logically only 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.849
 in my opinion as always indicated and in 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.410
 people who can not be 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.050
 necessarily sedentary and yet 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.580
 they are overweight 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.279
 the exercises that people with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.480
 overweight they have to carry out not 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.260
 they will try intensity with the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.089
 person that they have that weighs less 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.699
 generally the people who lack 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.469
 time to exercise either by 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.750
 your work or various obligations that 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.539
 have your life do not have that much time 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.909
 to do exercises fully and 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.320
 that's why sometimes they are not at your goal 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.020
 quickly 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.280
 I recently uploaded a video of the 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.070
 food for the person with 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 overweight which is pretty good and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.059
 it would be good to really see it for 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.920
 be more focused on this topic and be able to 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.969
 well solve this issue more quickly 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.900
 it would be something to say it somehow 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.790
 very practical and very 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.190
 very advantageous for a person with 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.070
 overweight that goes running is not 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 necessarily to be agreed as if 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 I would be running the marathon not 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.370
 necessarily have to run 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.960
 hurried on 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.970
 you do not necessarily have to run to the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.710
 speed with which you want to mark some 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 record type not only came out to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.400
 run jogging at what speed to which 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 you like it if you want 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.840
 that is a good 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.549
 how much comfortable clothes 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.049
 and directly in the square or some 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.210
 park near this case of domicile 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.070
 they start to run if this can be very 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.289
 basic can be if this can be 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.990
 anyone does not need to 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.509
 nobody tell me 40 hours is fine but 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.939
 you do it really I think many 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.240
 people say yes it could be but not 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.979
 they do it 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.920
 came back he whistled this is my opinion 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.299
 only but to most people 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 not to mention all the people who 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.100
 help 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.350
 they usually thanked me when I 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.390
 I said what they have to be which 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.569
 It seemed very basic but it really is very 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.220
 cash he knew how to run exercises all the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.220
 body all joints 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.090
 each is a quantity of calories 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.140
 very large compared to other 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.210
 exercise that can be done 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.150
 generation not necessarily a person 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.370
 that is obese you a little past of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.660
 weight they have to go to the gym woven and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.500
 finally are you are machines are 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 games of exercises 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.400
 hypertrophy to be and think 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.290
 that being too much the amount of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.040
 repetition exercises will go down 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.990
 of weight is not the overweight person and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.780
 finish the most important secret of this 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.330
 video the overweight person does not 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.430
 you need the machines 100% for 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.459
 lose weight will only be a 10 a 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.490
 20% nothing else this I can not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.040
 discuss nobody because this is so 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.570
 to lose weight you have to run there 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.480
 to ride a bicycle also which 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.940
 it's more fun 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 they put new places are a tour 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.360
 that they like the bike leg 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.790
 and back already with that they will perspire 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.700
 much if the obese person transpires 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 When we run everything, we are on the right track 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.680
 yes yes we are tired when they attack us 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.110
 we go for a way but be as I said 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.290
 before running is the best 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.180
 not exceed the limits is very important 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.670
 does not mean that without pain there is no 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.900
 benefit this is not so if one is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.460
 running and you feel that you have pains 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.560
 in the knees or on the heels or 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.670
 feet do not keep running first 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.950
 we solve the problem of the knees 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.230
 and from the feet to then start a 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.390
 plan but well we're supposed to be 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.640
 watching this video we are all fit 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.490
 physical to be able to start the routine of 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.560
 exercises but if not then we must go 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.050
 to the doctor the same and to be a physical act 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.720
 running is excellent for very many 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.870
 grounds 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.210
 of this salary the whole girl increases 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.920
 lung capacity so we're going to 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.410
 practice much better when we run 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.960
 when we go any kind of activity 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.220
 although it is also very good to lower the 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.080
 expenses to go up and down constantly 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.400
 very good not necessarily with pesos 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.620
 there are some people who make two small pieces 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.390
 small with dumbbells from burgos up 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.250
 five kilos each one is expected towards 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.550
 down but not 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.319
 we are talking about running 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.770
 run up exercises the shoulders the 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:35.920
 arms the back of the back 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.380
 logically the arms when one runs 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.000
 does not improve self-esteem makes us see 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.660
 better to perspire to eliminate a 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.330
 innumerable amount of toxins 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.940
 well and logically before and after 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.560
 run we have that home has gone up 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.190
 innumerable amount of videos on the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.300
 nation is to aspire more videos several that 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.810
 you can see it quietly here below 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.360
 in the list of exercises 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.950
 another very good exercise while we are 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.110
 sitting in the office and we work 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.490
 for 8 days there are people who work 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.710
 up to 11 12 hours 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.160
 it is convenient to lift from time to time 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.160
 the arms 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.050
 the other 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.050
 lift up one single 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.010
 back and we go to work the 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.600
 arms but let's go forward 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.910
 this is not the same as a person who 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.310
 do not make it not do it health one can 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.520
 say yes but this is basic if it is 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.980
 basic and it is effective also this helps 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.960
 to which circulations are doing 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.780
 some way oiled so he wants 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.580
 say that we are going to see some movements 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.530
 rather better than a person who does not 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.790
 makes them or is one is not the same as the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.840
 man from time to time as of the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.330
 arms from time to time after the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.580
 constant possession a matter counting 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.710
 and that a person who bags is a 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.870
 advantage serves if it serves at the moment of 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.150
 do the exercise 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.620
 tail is not only going to benefit in 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.479
 what it is 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.520
 in physical appearance be your 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.960
 performance willing to go with much more 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.220
 energy you're going to see with more face 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.320
 thin 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.490
 the famous jowl as they say several 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.490
 disappearing with time 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:18.309
 adipose tissue under the arms 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.649
 that sometimes plays a little pressure some 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:23.199
 way more this is going to benefit you 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:25.270
 much in many aspects you will be 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.719
 much better in your life whatever 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.709
 sentimental in professional labor 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.300
 because when losing weight 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:35.840
 we see ourselves better and seeing ourselves better 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:39.090
 we have more self-esteem to say so 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.470
 as positive as possible to encourage you 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.870
 that you run that is one of the most 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.760
 natural that can be as long as 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.170
 be with supervision and and observe the 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.180
