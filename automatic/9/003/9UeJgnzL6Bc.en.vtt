00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.450
 second enemy of the major don video so 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.429
 I take you now only times 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.900
 temporarily 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.759
 yes i have some new hints 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.540
 I found that you in now 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.949
 wants to communicate 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 Note number one is in the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 funkturm 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:26.880
 this note on the draufsteht six 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 Handel's six hundred is meant to be 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.890
 which translates in English as is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:39.510
 actually 600 meters or 600 chris so 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.620
 is equal to my string and that it is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 just finish for instance and instance 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.090
 means translated to German then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.370
 insurances are 600 meters 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 my insurance 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 that would fit in here theoretically 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 to 600 meters are mine 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 my protection from the huge hype and the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.470
 island I just show you there so 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 should at least be about degree 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.040
 It is about 62 meters from the tower 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 that means it would be removed 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 unfortunately it was on the server 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.369
 I was not a healey and transport guy 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.439
 Only with the transport tilly you can 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.060
 But you also have to fly over it 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.070
 the transport over there only ten 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 seconds to get out 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.000
 and there for special things too 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.580
 search 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.030
 10 seconds are very little 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.770
 if you do not know what's trying 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.210
 that's just the main problem what you do 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.829
 Of course you can have a couple 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.090
 one flies the transport of the one 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.310
 jump out and in again 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 nevertheless one has then only about four 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.610
 to five seconds time around there something to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.950
 looking and you are not so synonymous 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.170
 far away if you do not have the full time 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 can use 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 that is so that mainly problem yes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.510
 then I have one more 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 I found a golden heart 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.230
 not now if that's what with the mac 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.970
 london has to do with itself or whether that 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.680
 what has to do with the story has the story 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.080
 I did not play completely 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.790
 only the first three missions played 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.830
 that means I can not there unfortunately 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.690
 it close to it but thought 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.270
 I'll tell me that maybe 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.700
 if it helps people get closer to it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.680
 the mac lagan or at the time 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.930
 get hold 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.950
 and then I'm down again 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.690
 The broken ship is clever around there 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 just to find something but my opinion 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.990
 after you found nothing there I 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.560
 I just wanted you to do that again 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.520
 show how he gets into the ship 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 Not too hard if you can 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.900
 I know how it works at the back 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.660
 I call it loading area in and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 then jump in the corner is pure 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.130
 actually pretty easy 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.420
 Everyone should be able to do that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.980
 but as I said I have nothing 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.680
 found but maybe you have there 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.290
 More luck to find something 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.820
 And yes, if you find something then skin 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.590
 are the comments or made video 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.530
 and post the link, I have nothing 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 on the other hand 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.350
 maybe a short explanation yes 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.600
 I know that many are doing the videos 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.660
 and that the information is partly 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.360
 Cover the others with others as well 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.310
 but I'm pretty much out 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.900
 the only German or we the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.540
 former German at least what now 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.450
 so far that has been with the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.160
 deal with the topic and therefore wanted 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.250
 I here you with the latest 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.620
 keep your information up to date 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.680
 I think that with that on the tower 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.269
 1000 105.000 15 meters stands the monument 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.970
 By now everyone knows I too 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.200
 again briefly shown in the video, however 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.900
 I can not really do something with it 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.840
 start the 1000 1015 meters during 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.110
 circa that the question is removed on the me 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.340
 I am now at the conclusion, however, how 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.810
 I did not say anything there 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.940
 found and I should not do anything 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.739
 striking striking up to that 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.959
 you can clap under the boat 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.610
 but as I said if yes, what finds skin 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.020
 are the comments or post video 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.910
 answer whatever 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 and I thank you for your help and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.010
 See you at the next video 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.010
 bye bye
