00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.990
 afige 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.359

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.200
 dress like that 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.250

 this crab namely novak nifiga not 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.040
 I can do absolutely nothing 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.319
 do so like min very much big 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 amount and from this big 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.130
 min numbers 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.239

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.150

 go nuts everywhere guys everywhere mines and in 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.170
 principle even if i am somehow indulging 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.239
 on the center but reach the corner and yes to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.709
 Sorry I ca n't play Jack yet 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.540
 machine gun which of course will make it difficult 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.370
 the fact of taking it will be quite 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.970
 difficult so damn another damn well more 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.340
 here one remains and in principle, okay 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.760
 To go nuts like one from one mine you 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.150
 completely full plus under the brand I'm 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.709
 shocked 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.890

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:26.209

 I understand, I understand how to act min 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.580
 in the middle there is practically no 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.530
 accordingly, we can conclude that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.780
 what to take and here are the vegetables 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.230
