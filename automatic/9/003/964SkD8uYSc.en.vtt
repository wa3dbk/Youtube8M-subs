now I think the downfall having that
kind<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.009> human<00:01:59.670> experience<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:01.320> you're

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
kind of human experience because you're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
kind of human experience because you're
not<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:02.159> paying<00:02:02.670> attention<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
not really paying attention to the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.050 
not really paying attention to the
emotional<00:02:03.780> honesty<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.299> if<00:02:07.009> if

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
emotional honesty that you have if if

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.960 
emotional honesty that you have if if
you<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.569> struggle
