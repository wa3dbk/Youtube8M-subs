00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about the same 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.259
 show pyramids 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.059
 I bought it in light tape for 9 dollars 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 before going into details I have to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.940
 say that this puzzle is fantastic the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 movement of the layers is fast is very 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.510
 fast and at the same time it is controllable 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 As you can see, this puzzle has some 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 balls that prevent the cube from continuing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.269
 spinning when his movement ends 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.980
 for example I do this and the cube is left 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.560
 Stable stays in one position 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.060
 certain something and is stable we 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.189
 keep going around that's why I say it's 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.050
 controllable one could think the same as 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 these balls make the movement worse 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 but not at all the movement of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 layers is still very soft and very very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 faster, I can turn even this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.340
 puzzle with a finger you see that it does not have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.960
 no kind of problem you tour 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.210
 perfectly is nothing is wonderful and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.350
 the external parts that they will bring 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.270
 also without problem as you see they do not have 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.030
 no problem and in addition these parts 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.210
 are removed very easily if 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.090
 we do like this and you see that we have here a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.850
 screw in case we want to adjust 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.219
 in a simple way simply 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 we remove the lid and adjust it because 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.719
 they do not like it as much as it comes in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.880
 the box because nothing loosens it a little or 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.920
 we press it and it's easier 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.479
 impossible let's put it on again 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.219
 As you can see, he has no difficulty in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.409
 have the mechanism of clicking on a 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.250
 beginning when I make the coat turn 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.929
 it is perfectly aligned no click 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.609
 aligned click aligned if it is true 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.039
 when we are solving it fast 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.929
 when we are doing speed club is 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.009
 likely that at some point we have 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.649
 something like that and before aligning the layer 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.939
 let's make the next turn then 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.640
 Of course we are interested to know if this 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.709
 short pyramid or not cut corners let's go 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
 to see the direct cut suppose that 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.049
 we have this like that and now we do like that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.509
 have no more problems what 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.549
 it does a bit more perfectly too 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 they do it then you see that the cut 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.209
 direct from this pyramid is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.729
 impressive however in the cut 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:11.009
 inverse has problems vale stays 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.510
 blocked let's move a little bit 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.690
 this layer and now we make a cut 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.260
 reverse 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.880
 the pyramid stays completely 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.860
 blocked this is the only problem that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920
 I can find this pyramid for 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.530
 the rest is perfect anyway 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 have the click mechanism the layers 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.930
 should be well aligned before 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.000
 start the next movement and since 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.130
 we are talking about reverse cut let's 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 to talk a little about pop this pyramid 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.980
 it does pop because it does not do pop at all 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.600
 I have solved it several times 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.040
 we tried hard enough to force a 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.440
 reverse cut that would be the only 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.780
 situation where I can do pop and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.970
 As you can see, although strength is not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.740
 little at all is blocked and already 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.900
 is then we can solve it 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.570
 quietly without worrying about the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.360
 little will not do little at any time 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.490
 this is one of the cubes that he does not know 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 the meaning of the word pop the 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.790
 stickers are of good quality and in addition 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.100
 they have very happy colors I do not know if 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.860
 it is appreciated well here with the light but the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.430
 colors are very vivid and very nice to 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.160
 the view 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.360
 they do not get up easily either 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.610
 I've used it a lot really 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.650
 and none of these corners has been 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.750
 raised the least and also have 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.520
 a thickness these stickers higher than 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.320
 normal let's see it with a little zoom 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.600
 here you can see with a little more 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.110
 detail how effectively the stickers 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.900
 they have a certain thickness this pyramid is 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.460
 I recommend it to everyone 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.310
 regardless of whether you are a 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.860
 spitfire or simply a person who 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.430
 is going to solve the pyramid because from time to time 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.500
 when it seems an incredible product 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.590
 the truth is I'm very happy with him 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.010
 it's not that I'm a big fan of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.270
 solve pyramids but it seems to me that 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.820
 after having been a while with 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.040
 this pyramid and after having seen 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.280
 many videos on the internet with opinions 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.930
 of several people because I have come to the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.480
 conclusion that this pyramid should be 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.370
 the best in the man market too 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.840
 they say that the Mayfair version is very 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.700
 well but good I think more or less 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.700
 should therefore be of the same quality as 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.870
 because it is very difficult to be superior 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.820
 I can not find this pyramid 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 practically no problem the only thing 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.600
 the small block when you make the cut 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 inverse from time to time but good 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.200
 problems to find him something so 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.540
 others I find impressive once 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.790
 more an extensive product with a relationship 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.580
 Unbeatable value since 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.810
 remember that it costs nine dollars and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.610
 you can get some times 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.520
 awesome and do speed club with 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.710
 she is also perfectly adjustable 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.300
 in a very simple way let's go I do not 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.520
 I find no problem I'm very 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560
 happy with her so I do not expect anything 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.240
 that you are encouraged to buy it that has 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.240
 liked the video and see you in another
