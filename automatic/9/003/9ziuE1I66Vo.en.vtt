00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.900
 Doraleous: After many days on our expedition we finally returned to our fortress 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.470
 Doraleous: Hmmm ... what is this giant wooden horse? 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 Dragon: What the hell? 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.950
 Doraleous: Cha, I know what it is! This is a gift from the Weetals! 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.239
 Dragon: Aah-Weetalde! 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.650
 Doraleous: I knew it! He knew I would be rewarded with nothing but a fucking stick 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.330
 Doraleous: I call this a gift! 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.550
 Dragon: They gave you, Doralee! 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.460
 Doraleous: Not just me - it's a gift to us! They really appreciate what we've done for them 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 Mirdon: I've seen something like this before. We must be careful 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 Doraleous: Don't paint a devil on the wall 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 Mirdon: It's poorly done - it'll break up in a week 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.239
 But please! 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.330
 Neebs: Come on, Mirdon! They built it for us! 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.809
 Doraleous: It's very nice, I'm moved 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.400
 Mirdon: I don't think it's from the Weetals! If it were, it would be made of acorns and bones 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.580
 Dragon: Doraleous crying! 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.740
 Doraleous: I'm not crying! I'm just moved! 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.440
 Neebs: You're a little girl 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.750
 Sir Walken: Just don't be shy! 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 Doraleous: This is the guys-they're noticing us 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.380
 Dragon: You're right 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.120
 Doraleous: Ok guys, plan for today: pull it to the courtyard and then you fell 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 'cause Sir Walken and I walk a little and bring something 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 and when we get back-going party! 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.030
 Neebs: Blow Up When You Get Back? 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.920
 Mirdon: Peck! 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.600
 Doraleous: You deserve it! We all deserve it! Neebs: Beware! 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539
 Everyone: Great! 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.960
 Mirdon: I like this 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289
 Doraleous: So go back to the courtyard and see you tonight 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.920
 Neebs: Rely! 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.869
 Mirdon: Rest Doralee! 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.140
 Doraleous: So in the evening! 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 Mirdon: Did you see him crying? Like a little bitch 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.360
 Sir Walken: Doralee - it's a strange bunch, but I think you're working well 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810
 Doraleous: I think so too, Sire Walken 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 Sir Walken: But the dwarf, his voice ... unpleasant to listen to - or am I the only one who bothers? 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.259
 Doraleous: You're not, it's not pleasant 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.090
 Doraleous: Some think of you, too, that your voice is annoying 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.200
 Sir Walken: Nonsense-people love my voice 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.640
 (from a distance): Help! 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.750
 Doraleous: Did you hear that? 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.650
 Sir Walken: Sounds like a virgin in trouble! 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.810
 Boy: No no no! 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.410
 Bandit 1: Hang it! 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.020
 Badntia 2: No! We gut him! 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.210
 Doraleous: Leave the kid alone! 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.840
 Bandit 2: What are you? 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.940
 Doraleous: My name is Doraleous! And today is not your lucky day! 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.370
 Bandit 1: No! Today is NOT YOUR HAPPY DAY! 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.230
 Doraleous: No! Today is not your lucky day! 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.660
 Bandit 2: But it is! 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.960
 Doraleous: No! 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.030
 Bandit 1: It is! 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.260
 Doraleous: Enough! I am a well-trained warrior and I would be very happy if I didn't have to kill anyone today 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960
 if I don't have to 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.500
 Bandits: On Him! 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.120
 Sir Walken: Doralee-why did you do that? 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.800
 Doraleous: Sir Walken-these guys chose their fate 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500
 Sir Walken: I don't mean - I mean, you returned the sword from the blood without wiping it! 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.670
 The blood and the other things will make you blunt, and then the sword will rust - it will reduce its value 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.900
 Doraleous: Nojo-I'll clean it later 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.310
 Sir Walken: Oh! I love to hear that! And I'll wipe my ass tomorrow! 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.440
 Doraleous: Are you okay? 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.110
 Boy: Yes sir! Thank you! I'm so glad you saved me 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.010
 Doraleous: Don't you want to go home or something? 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.230
 Boy: Not at all! This is my home! I live in the woods! 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.960
 Doraleous: Really? 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.220
 Boy: Yes! Shackelton has just a summer vacation! 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.560
 Sir Walken: Shackelton? It's a wizarding school! 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.280
 Boy: You're right! The best! They teach me so much and I have many friends there 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.040
 Sir Walken: I like to hear that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.640
 Doraleous: Do you know what we're gonna do? Do you want to see us in our fortress? For a few days? 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.950
 Boy: I'd love that! It sounds great! 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.970
 Doraleous: Okay, my name is Doraleous-and this is Sir Walken 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 Boy: Nice to meet you 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.930
 Boy: My name is Harry. Harry Poser
