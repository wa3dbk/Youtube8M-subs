threshold didn't land it would have made

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
threshold didn't land it would have made
a<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.629> gang<00:00:40.020> keable<00:00:40.350> lane<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> rest<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
a more gang keable lane for the rest of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
a more gang keable lane for the rest of
EG<00:00:41.940> later<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> flash<00:00:43.079> they

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
EG later but they got the flash they

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.260 
EG later but they got the flash they
also<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> before<00:00:44.129> Ward's<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.090> down

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
also got it before Ward's could go down

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
also got it before Ward's could go down
so<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.870> know<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> their<00:00:46.410> invades<00:00:46.710> can

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so they know that their invades can

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
so they know that their invades can
continue<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.789> successful<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.480> might<00:00:48.660> try

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
continue to be successful they might try

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
continue to be successful they might try
