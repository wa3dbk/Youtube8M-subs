00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
touch pad LCD screen built into it and
on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> controller<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.800> a

on the back of the controller has a
little<00:01:02.100> LED<00:01:02.430> light<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.439> that's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
little LED light and I think that's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.899 
little LED light and I think that's
going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.220> there's<00:01:08.430> four<00:01:08.670> lights

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
going to be you know there's four lights

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
going to be you know there's four lights
on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> PlayStation<00:01:09.900> controller<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.350> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
on the PlayStation controller now for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
on the PlayStation controller now for
our<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:11.040> control<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.490> 124<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
our your control of 124 I think it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
our your control of 124 I think it's
going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> may<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.770> four<00:01:14.040> different<00:01:14.189> colors

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
going to may have four different colors

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.300 
going to may have four different colors
or<00:01:14.820> several<00:01:15.240> different<00:01:15.600> colors<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.950> can

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
or several different colors so you can

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
or several different colors so you can
know<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.610> controllers<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.509> just

pretty<00:01:18.960> cool<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.380> anything<00:01:19.680> LED<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
pretty cool because anything LED is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.840 
pretty cool because anything LED is
pretty<00:01:20.610> tighten<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.290> just

a game and watch my friend play ps4
rather<00:01:39.329> than<00:01:39.570> spectating<00:01:40.229> could<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> get

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
rather than spectating could you get

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.359 
rather than spectating could you get
Kate<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> after<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> certain<00:01:41.340> wild<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Kate that after a certain wild time so I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
Kate that after a certain wild time so I
think<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.750> cool

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

record their game would you I think is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.770 
record their game would you I think is
pretty<00:01:56.430> tight<00:01:58.130> considering<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> know

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
pretty tight considering you know

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.060 
pretty tight considering you know
youtube<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> streaming<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> future<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
youtube and streaming is the future of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.289 
youtube and streaming is the future of
gaming<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.600> ps4<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:05.149> equipped<00:02:06.149> with

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
gaming I think the ps4 is equipped with

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.020 
gaming I think the ps4 is equipped with
i<00:02:07.009> would<00:02:08.009> say<00:02:08.190> basically<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.789> like

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
i would say basically something like

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.020 
i would say basically something like
google<00:02:09.360> ads<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:11.550> basically<00:02:11.700> scans

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
google ads because it basically scans

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.620 
google ads because it basically scans

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.380 
I don't know but it's just going to have
something<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.350> basically<00:02:30.120> tracks<00:02:31.120> more

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
something that basically tracks more

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.960 
something that basically tracks more
information<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.170> other<00:02:33.100> there's<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.550> 8

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
information so other there's a 8

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.990

gigabytes<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.600> RAM<00:02:34.840> which<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.520> 16<00:02:36.520> times<00:02:36.550> more

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
multitask a lot more because it comes

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:56.130

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
knows it seems like it has a built-in

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.040 
knows it seems like it has a built-in
capture<00:05:30.460> card<00:05:30.700> with<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.910> boatload<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.660> memory

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
capture card with a boatload of memory

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.760 
capture card with a boatload of memory
so<00:05:32.200> you'd<00:05:32.320> be<00:05:32.410> able<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:33.030> store<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.060> lot<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.770> game

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
so you'd be able to store a lot of game

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.710 
so you'd be able to store a lot of game
plays<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.340> question<00:05:36.880> now<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.060> if<00:05:37.300> you're<00:05:37.600> able

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
plays the question now is if you're able

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.930 
plays the question now is if you're able
to<00:05:38.080> transfer<00:05:38.620> that<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.800> your<00:05:39.040> computer<00:05:39.400> or<00:05:39.430> to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
to transfer that to your computer or to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.779 
to transfer that to your computer or to
youtube<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.450> stuff<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:42.100> I<00:05:42.370> think<00:05:42.610> their

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
youtube and stuff and I think their

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.210 
youtube and stuff and I think their
partner<00:05:43.240> with<00:05:43.450> partnered<00:05:44.229> with<00:05:44.260> you<00:05:44.860> stream

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
partner with partnered with you stream

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.740 
partner with partnered with you stream
so<00:05:45.430> that's<00:05:45.669> probably<00:05:45.940> going<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.180> be<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.330> main

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
so that's probably going to be the main

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.020 
so that's probably going to be the main
function<00:05:47.229> of<00:05:47.320> streaming<00:05:47.680> capabilities<00:05:48.370> but

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
function of streaming capabilities but

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.330 
function of streaming capabilities but
anyways<00:05:49.390> that's<00:05:49.720> about<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:49.990> for<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.350> ps4<00:05:50.620> boy

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
anyways that's about it for the ps4 boy

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.300 
anyways that's about it for the ps4 boy
