00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.270 

okay<00:00:59.170> guys<00:00:59.410> the<00:01:00.000> big<00:01:01.000> turnout<00:01:01.329> here<00:01:01.360> this<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
okay guys the big turnout here this it's

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.460 
okay guys the big turnout here this it's
rather<00:01:03.550> marginal<00:01:03.940> as<00:01:04.479> far<00:01:04.750> as<00:01:04.960> wind<00:01:05.229> is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
rather marginal as far as wind is

rather marginal as far as wind is
concerned<00:01:07.800> all<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:08.979> those<00:01:09.100> swirly<00:01:10.060> winds<00:01:10.240> as

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.190 

those<00:01:15.510> it<00:01:15.750> hard<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.680> predict<00:01:17.840> what<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:21.200> for

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
those it hard to predict what to do for
