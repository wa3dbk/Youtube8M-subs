00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.040
 canning deodorization 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.540
 hydrogenation pasteurization for 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.059
 modern food industry 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.160
 nothing is impossible no technology 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.739
 seek to improve product properties 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.540
 sometimes the best is the enemy of the good 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.180
 take for example refined oil 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.250
 the product is modern well useful or what 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.560
 in her mouth climbed useful but judging by 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.950
 advertising is information that is popular 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.950
 On the Internet, probably useful, I think that 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.629
 unrefined healthier but 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.050
 I use refined because she 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.370
 odorless and tasteless but still and the colors do not 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.289
 smokes and not singers 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.480
 we decided to understand the difficult 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.030
 the process of refining once and for all 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.210
 determine which oil is better 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.730
 use as an oil is exposed 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.809
 refining to start squeeze first 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.850
 portion of butter 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.510
 this is the very first cold 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.449
 spinning then considering what's in cheese 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.900
 there are still quite a lot of this 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.280
 oils and it undergoes processing 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.869
 hexane, that is a substance that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.770
 is a petrochemical product 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.570
 industry 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.060
 this is done in order to extract 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.610
 the remaining oil is then solvent 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 hexane must be evaporated 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.759
 is taken to argue that it is pretty 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.729
 toxic substance is completely eliminated 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.700
 from oil but also on this refining process 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.770
 then the oil does not end 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.930
 undergoes deodorization 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.560
 when those substances are removed that 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.590
 give it a smell also she is exposed 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.719
 freezing wax remover 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.689
 deplorable all that was in this product 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.730
 useful taken out of it completely and this 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.770
 vitamins d and and 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.470
 to healthy fats which is part 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.870
 our cell membranes are phospholipids and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.570
 biologically active substances if 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.810
 the cell is deficient in these substances 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.230
 for example phospholipids then it is more 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.350
 vulnerable to oxidative effects 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.020
 respectively 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 organism prone to more rapid 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 aging to faster occurrence 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.920
 various diseases down to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.970
 oncology and refined oil 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 olive 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.710
 no different from refined 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.710
 no corn or sunflower taste 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.720
 no smell well, except that the color is different so 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.550
 tint it is not difficult here 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.010
 fake and flowing river in general 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.900
 dispense technical oil 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.110
 refined nosach bulk very 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 fashionable and olive oil actually 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.490
 is any other oil except olive 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.250
 that is, it may be slavery it may 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.980
 be soy it could be cotton then 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.880
 have cheap well cleaned 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.100
 or vice versa not technically peeled 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 well this is a fake it is not comforting and 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.560
 statement made us go to 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.690
 shop for 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.070
 refined oil but before buying 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.360
 the correspondent decided nevertheless 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.360
 consult with the seller 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.200
 kumho 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.659
 and determine the raw materials from which 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.790
 Cooked butter can only be in 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.829
 laboratories of course for simple 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.930
 the buyer does not fit and exit here 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.269
 one to use oils 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 not refined true manufacturers 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.219
 claim fries on them is impossible 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.870
 unrefined oil is 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:34.459
 huge amount of phospholipids 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.349
 biologically active substances of vitamins 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.889
 who really don't like heating 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.959
 so when do you start regular butter 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.969
 impale at a temperature of about 120 and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.699
 130 degrees it starts to smoke 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:49.040
 smoking means disintegration has begun 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.530
 acids and carcinogens appeared in the oil 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.109
 but the critical temperature is different 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.790
 types of oil is not the same example 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.939
 sunflower oil begins to burn already 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.370
 at 110 degrees a 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.469
 unrefined olive only 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.949
 190 and that means cooking on it 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:09.349
 can be without fear if you are a gourmet and 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:12.949
 love experiments try butter 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:18.699
 avocado almond rapeseed or rice 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:18.699
 they are ready to glow up to 270 degrees
