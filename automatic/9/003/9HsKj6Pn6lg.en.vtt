00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 Today is summer, and this is the end of the song because it is a beginner 's guitar course this time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.970
 Shazam 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.570
 Well Naika' 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.570
 Do you want to do how to play this ? 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.070
 Haa 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 If it is decided that it is bad 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.630
 It looks like it's done 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.120
 I think I 'm going to play this way of playing so I think 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 Quite 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.990
 Because I think it is a course that was not likely before now 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.040
 If you can not, please try 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:42.690
 It's quick, but in the sense that it makes my left hand easy, this time e minor 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.649
 Keep it up and pull it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 It will be the point of this playing method 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.820
 After all it becomes how to use this right hand 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.820
 Let's start slowly 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.420
 car 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.000
 Like this 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 It will draw 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.750
 4 Jan Jaguar stretch with Shazam 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.750
 Well then mother three 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.410
 Quite right to stop the sound from out the sound 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:24.480
 So it is Sanno say 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.370
 So If you pull the Shazam is a stroke and 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.920
 Carn 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.740
 I will live after I pull Jean 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 Here 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 9 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 Stop the sound by brushing this part of this hand 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 I have difficulty Tteyuu stop unexpectedly segment I'm is easy to say that you will industry say 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.250
 you know 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.400
 The 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.400
 a 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.410
 It is like this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.920
 And do you want to do more slowly 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.120
 car 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 Right now 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.500
 hey 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.500
 hey 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:19.160
 It becomes like this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.880
 Now, I'll pull it down to Jakajan and start making the third sound and stop it now but it looks good 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.720
 Though 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:29.870
 I say so because the tempo is this it because it slowly becomes difficult as it becomes the faster tempo 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.090
 Tsu chic Toka anything if 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.740
 There are a few tips to get a clean sound 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.080
 That's right 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.450
 Jacker 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.870
 I'm playing properly until 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 Next stop 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 I'm going to stop 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.970
 1 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 I'm transparent but 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.130
 I also pull here 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.170
 At the same time there is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.170
 Play while stopping 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 The last sound is also relatively fast tempo 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.830
 It determined to clean 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.120
 Shazam and do slowly once 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 It is not 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.100
 The last sound is not real Jean 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.100
 Eh mute 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:37.630
 It sounds like a kind of brushing 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.630
 Even Well fast tempo and in that way 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.350
 I think it will stop somehow 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.880
 The last sound is Jagger 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.880
 Make a sound like a bridge mute 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.410
 I think it works well if you stop the sound 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.569
 As Edo Prich eyes came out 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.689
 Bridge of mute 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.240
 It may be good to practice just 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.870
 It is not do better 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:30.860
 here 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:35.210
 Huedu 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.790
 a I can do this 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.350
 eh 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:59.340
 And wonder if what you say say 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:05:03.150
 Buber who talks a lot and gives up 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:09.710
 I think it will be effective 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.710
 I'm going to talk about it slowly 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.480
 The 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.280
 Like this 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.650
 If I gradually increase the tempo somehow 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.600
 Jaguar team is the last 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.120
 Because I think the grain of wood is Akimaru 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.230
 Well , if you do it like that way, you will surely 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.130
 Shazam 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:43.260
 I think you can jump , so please try it 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.260
 This time, Thank you looks like
