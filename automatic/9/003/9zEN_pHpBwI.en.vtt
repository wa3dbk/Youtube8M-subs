YouTube so there's not much initial
setup<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.170> think<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.650> has<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:27.040> done<00:04:27.190> on

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
setup I think that has to be done on

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.620 
setup I think that has to be done on
this<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.700> hope<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.270> didn't<00:04:28.510> do<00:04:28.600> very

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
this I hope because I didn't do very

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.470 
this I hope because I didn't do very
much<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.680> pretty<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.370> just<00:04:30.580> installed

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
adjusted I don't expect them to be

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.000 
adjusted I don't expect them to be
because<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.050> lot<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.320> people<00:04:59.560> say<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.770> they

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.579 
is the only thing wrong with this stuff
I'm<00:05:40.849> gonna<00:05:41.029> call<00:05:41.299> it<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.539> day<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.719> happily<00:05:42.439> ever

after

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.799 

but<00:05:57.889> I<00:05:58.129> mean<00:05:58.729> if<00:05:58.879> I<00:05:58.999> were<00:05:59.149> building<00:05:59.360> something

00:05:59.799 --> 00:05:59.809 
but I mean if I were building something

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.959 
but I mean if I were building something
I'd<00:06:00.619> be<00:06:00.829> somewhere<00:06:01.159> else<00:06:01.219> in<00:06:01.399> the<00:06:01.489> shaft<00:06:01.759> and

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969 
I'd be somewhere else in the shaft and

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.139 
I'd be somewhere else in the shaft and
something<00:06:02.360> else<00:06:02.449> right<00:06:02.719> now<00:06:03.879> now<00:06:04.879> what<00:06:05.119> I

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:05.149 
something else right now now what I

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.369 
something else right now now what I
think<00:06:05.269> I'm<00:06:05.569> going<00:06:05.689> to<00:06:05.749> turn<00:06:05.929> this<00:06:06.049> up<00:06:06.229> a<00:06:06.289> notch

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
think I'm going to turn this up a notch

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.879 
think I'm going to turn this up a notch
so<00:06:07.149> this<00:06:08.149> saw<00:06:08.360> has<00:06:08.509> just<00:06:08.929> officially<00:06:09.079> survived

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
so this saw has just officially survived

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.569 
so this saw has just officially survived
its<00:06:10.189> first<00:06:10.459> ever<00:06:10.669> cut<00:06:12.159> stupid<00:06:13.159> dog

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:13.579

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
and here's what we got as you can see it

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.019 
and here's what we got as you can see it
is<00:06:16.939> pretty<00:06:17.689> much<00:06:17.929> dead<00:06:18.259> on<00:06:18.289> square<00:06:18.799> right<00:06:19.729> now

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
is pretty much dead on square right now

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
is pretty much dead on square right now
I<00:06:20.239> had<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:20.539> off<00:06:20.689> my<00:06:20.959> bed<00:06:21.159> there<00:06:22.689> that's<00:06:23.689> how

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:24.049 
I had it off my bed there that's how

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:27.309 
I had it off my bed there that's how
that's<00:06:24.289> definitely<00:06:24.829> good<00:06:24.979> enough<00:06:25.069> for<00:06:25.369> me<00:06:26.319> and

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
that's definitely good enough for me and

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.449 
that's definitely good enough for me and
as<00:06:27.769> you<00:06:27.949> can<00:06:28.069> see<00:06:28.279> here<00:06:29.529> one<00:06:30.529> one<00:06:31.009> edge<00:06:31.159> of<00:06:31.339> this

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
as you can see here one one edge of this

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.759 
as you can see here one one edge of this
piece<00:06:31.729> here<00:06:32.029> was<00:06:32.179> cut<00:06:32.389> off<00:06:32.449> with<00:06:32.599> the<00:06:32.959> chop<00:06:33.469> saw

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:33.769 
piece here was cut off with the chop saw

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:36.009 
piece here was cut off with the chop saw
and<00:06:34.069> that's<00:06:34.429> this<00:06:34.639> edge<00:06:34.909> we've<00:06:35.599> got<00:06:35.869> an

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:36.019 
and that's this edge we've got an

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:38.409 
and that's this edge we've got an
iceberg<00:06:36.499> right<00:06:36.829> along<00:06:37.099> here<00:06:37.519> and<00:06:37.729> it's<00:06:38.209> turned

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
iceberg right along here and it's turned

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.059 
iceberg right along here and it's turned
blue<00:06:38.719> so<00:06:38.749> you<00:06:38.989> can<00:06:39.139> tell<00:06:39.319> got<00:06:39.529> nice<00:06:39.739> and<00:06:39.919> hot

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
blue so you can tell got nice and hot

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.179 
blue so you can tell got nice and hot
and<00:06:40.329> over<00:06:41.329> here<00:06:41.599> at<00:06:41.899> the<00:06:42.049> bandsaw<00:06:42.529> here's<00:06:43.129> a

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
and over here at the bandsaw here's a

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.839 
and over here at the bandsaw here's a
much<00:06:43.459> smaller<00:06:44.209> burr<00:06:44.569> and<00:06:45.309> those<00:06:46.309> signs<00:06:46.639> that

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
much smaller burr and those signs that

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.639 
much smaller burr and those signs that
had<00:06:46.969> ever<00:06:47.089> got<00:06:47.299> that<00:06:47.479> hot<00:06:47.689> so<00:06:48.049> that's<00:06:48.319> good

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:48.649 
had ever got that hot so that's good

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.669 
had ever got that hot so that's good
anyway<00:06:49.579> the<00:06:49.729> first<00:06:49.909> cut<00:06:50.299> took<00:06:51.019> forever<00:06:51.349> and<00:06:51.529> I

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:51.679 
anyway the first cut took forever and I

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.109 
anyway the first cut took forever and I
