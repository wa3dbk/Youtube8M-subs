same cable just split the TV cable comes
straight<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.110> internet<00:02:10.530> cable<00:02:11.310> goes

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
straight in and the internet cable goes

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.060 
straight in and the internet cable goes
through<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> modem<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:13.380> back<00:02:13.709> into<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
through a modem and then back into the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.520 
through a modem and then back into the
land<00:02:14.370> card<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.480> computer<00:02:15.930> so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
land card in the back of the computer so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
land card in the back of the computer so
we're<00:02:16.980> fusing<00:02:17.400> together<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.850> internet<00:02:18.239> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we're fusing together the internet and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.380 
we're fusing together the internet and
television<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.500> all<00:02:19.920> sorts<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.340> things<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.330> if
