well<00:00:06.180> I'm<00:00:06.330> really<00:00:06.479> lucky<00:00:06.779> today<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.380> in<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
well I'm really lucky today I'm in a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.320 
well I'm really lucky today I'm in a
swim<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:07.889> and<00:00:08.370> I've<00:00:08.490> been<00:00:08.639> able<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> bring<00:00:09.090> my

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
swim now and I've been able to bring my

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390 
swim now and I've been able to bring my
truck<00:00:09.630> right<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.170> close<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.340> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
truck right up close to it so this is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.500 
truck right up close to it so this is
fantastic

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
fantastic

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.630 
fantastic
no<00:00:13.110> lugging<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.769> heavy<00:00:13.980> gear<00:00:14.280> around

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:14.640 
no lugging all that heavy gear around

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.089 
no lugging all that heavy gear around
and<00:00:15.420> now<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.780> I'm<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.049> position<00:00:16.349> I'm<00:00:16.980> going

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
and now that I'm in position I'm going

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.679 
and now that I'm in position I'm going
to<00:00:17.189> use<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> piece<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> kit<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.179> become<00:00:18.449> more

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
to use a piece of kit that's become more

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.239 
to use a piece of kit that's become more
and<00:00:18.810> more<00:00:18.900> important<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.650> modern<00:00:19.890> carp

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:20.249 
and more important in modern carp

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.859 
and more important in modern carp
fishing<00:00:20.519> and<00:00:20.730> that's<00:00:20.849> a<00:00:20.999> marker<00:00:21.359> float<00:00:21.570> rod

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
fishing and that's a marker float rod

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
fishing and that's a marker float rod
now<00:00:22.589> you<00:00:22.919> don't<00:00:23.099> have<00:00:23.249> to<00:00:23.429> use<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:23.880> these

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
now you don't have to use one of these

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.120 
now you don't have to use one of these
setups<00:00:24.359> every<00:00:25.019> time<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.529> carp<00:00:25.890> fishing

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
setups every time you go carp fishing

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.979 
setups every time you go carp fishing
wouldn't<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.089> get<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.449> familiar<00:00:27.659> with

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
wouldn't you get really familiar with

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.139 
wouldn't you get really familiar with
your<00:00:28.349> lake<00:00:28.619> you'll<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.189> able<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> cast<00:00:29.699> almost

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
your lake you'll be able to cast almost

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.150 
your lake you'll be able to cast almost
in<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.419> dark<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> classic<00:00:31.829> spots

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
in the dark to some of the classic spots

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
in the dark to some of the classic spots
and<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:32.880> fishing<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.510> small

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and if you're fishing a really small

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
and if you're fishing a really small
water<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> marker<00:00:35.309> float<00:00:35.489> probably<00:00:35.970> isn't

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
water then a marker float probably isn't

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
water then a marker float probably isn't
really<00:00:36.480> essential<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.560> on<00:00:37.680> large<00:00:37.890> open

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really essential but on large open

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.070 
really essential but on large open
waters<00:00:38.790> particularly<00:00:39.390> you'll<00:00:39.630> find<00:00:39.900> one<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
waters particularly you'll find one of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.290 
waters particularly you'll find one of
these<00:00:40.260> invaluable<00:00:40.760> what<00:00:41.760> does<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.880> marker

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
these invaluable what does a marker

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
these invaluable what does a marker
float<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.810> up<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.200> well<00:00:43.500> primarily<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.340> does

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
float set up do well primarily it does

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.480 
float set up do well primarily it does
three<00:00:44.820> things<00:00:45.170> first<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.740> can<00:00:47.250> help

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
three things first of all it can help

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.490 
three things first of all it can help
you<00:00:47.640> gauge<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.210> depth<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.020> you'll<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.260> able<00:00:49.380> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you gauge the depth so you'll be able to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.350 
you gauge the depth so you'll be able to
find<00:00:49.710> depth<00:00:50.010> variations<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> lake<00:00:51.120> by

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
find depth variations in the lake by

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
find depth variations in the lake by
casting<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.400> marker<00:00:53.760> float

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
casting out and using the marker float

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.290 
casting out and using the marker float
as<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> depth<00:00:54.660> gauge<00:00:55.400> secondly<00:00:56.400> it<00:00:56.700> can<00:00:57.000> act<00:00:57.150> as

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
as a depth gauge secondly it can act as

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
as a depth gauge secondly it can act as
a<00:00:57.360> target<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.230> bait<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.220> rig

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a target for your bait and for your rig

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
a target for your bait and for your rig
so<00:00:59.790> that's<00:00:59.970> very<00:01:00.150> important<00:01:00.810> to<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.380> then

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so that's very important to and then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160 
so that's very important to and then
thirdly<00:01:02.130> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> set<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.060> upright<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.989> can

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thirdly if you set it upright it can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
thirdly if you set it upright it can
also<00:01:04.320> tell<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:05.070> deal<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
also tell you a great deal about the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.819 
also tell you a great deal about the
bottom<00:01:06.329> out<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.780> whether<00:01:07.259> your<00:01:07.409> fish<00:01:07.590> nose

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
bottom out there whether your fish nose

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.779 
bottom out there whether your fish nose
sand<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.729> gravel<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.299> silt<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.229> weed<00:01:10.549> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.759> a

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
sand or gravel or silt or weed this is a

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.260 
sand or gravel or silt or weed this is a
very<00:01:12.060> basic<00:01:12.840> marker<00:01:13.499> float<00:01:13.679> setup<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.999> float

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
very basic marker float setup the float

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
very basic marker float setup the float
is<00:01:15.450> brightly<00:01:16.140> colored<00:01:16.649> you'll<00:01:17.280> find<00:01:17.579> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
is brightly colored you'll find that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.849 
is brightly colored you'll find that
orange<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.990> dark<00:01:19.319> colored

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
orange is very good for dark colored

water black is very good on shiny water

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.770 
water black is very good on shiny water
but<00:01:22.889> essentially<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> nice<00:01:24.299> buoyant

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
but essentially you want a nice buoyant

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.849 
but essentially you want a nice buoyant
float<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> you're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.499> to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.649> able<00:01:25.770> to

isn't<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.979> looks<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.340> something

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
isn't it really it looks like something

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
isn't it really it looks like something

out of a dr. who movie so why is the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
out of a dr. who movie so why is the
lead<00:01:52.740> design<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.029> nodules

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lead design like this well these nodules

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.419

the<00:01:59.159> line<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.670> better<00:02:00.029> than<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.779> regular

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the line much better than a regular

high this is a very robust braid and
actually<00:02:15.780> 30<00:02:16.110> pound<00:02:16.560> is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
actually 30 pound is

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.160 
actually 30 pound is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the diameter of eight pound line so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750 
the diameter of eight pound line so

up to the rigors of marker float fishing

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.399 
up to the rigors of marker float fishing
you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.069> cast<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.640> very<00:02:23.909> long<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
you can cast it a very long way now the

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.530 
you can cast it a very long way now the
reason<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:26.040> use<00:02:26.099> braids<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:27.000> primarily

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
reason that you use braids is primarily

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.630 
reason that you use braids is primarily
because<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.680> drag<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.129> led<00:02:29.370> back

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
because when you drag this led back

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.059 
because when you drag this led back
across<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.000> bottom<00:02:30.329> braid<00:02:31.230> has<00:02:31.590> virtually

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
across the bottom braid has virtually

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.690 
across the bottom braid has virtually
zero<00:02:32.700> stretch<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.959> any<00:02:34.459> vibrations<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.610> are

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
zero stretch so any vibrations that are

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
zero stretch so any vibrations that are
sent<00:02:35.940> back<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.450> line<00:02:36.569> any<00:02:36.810> information

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
sent back up the line any information

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.500 
sent back up the line any information
about<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.069> nature<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.610> bottom<00:02:38.940> will<00:02:39.390> be

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
about the nature of the bottom will be

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.649 
about the nature of the bottom will be
amplified<00:02:39.900> by<00:02:40.170> braid<00:02:40.739> mono<00:02:41.640> cushions<00:02:42.360> those

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
amplified by braid mono cushions those

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.660 
amplified by braid mono cushions those
signals<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.129> got<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.549> much

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
signals because it's got so much

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.660 
signals because it's got so much
elasticity<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.930> won't<00:02:46.170> feel<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.430> much

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
elasticity and you won't feel so much

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.819 
elasticity and you won't feel so much

far<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.180> marker<00:03:27.540> float<00:03:28.049> rod<00:03:28.290> that's<00:03:28.500> not

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
far with a marker float rod that's not

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.039 
far with a marker float rod that's not
up<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.069> job<00:03:29.099> so<00:03:29.609> distance<00:03:30.419> is<00:03:30.569> important

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
up to the job so distance is important

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.349 
up to the job so distance is important
the<00:03:31.139> rod<00:03:31.290> needs<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> be<00:03:31.769> able<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:32.099> cast<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:33.239> it

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
the rod needs to be able to cast but it

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.659 
the rod needs to be able to cast but it
also<00:03:33.540> needs<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.049> have<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.349> right<00:03:34.590> action<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
also needs to have the right action to

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.729 
also needs to have the right action to
transmit<00:03:36.269> information<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.560> line

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
transmit information back up the line

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.089 
transmit information back up the line
and<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.489> rods<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.359> that<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:40.709> call<00:03:40.980> it

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
and this rods got all of that we call it

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.789 
and this rods got all of that we call it
the<00:03:41.220> g-spot<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:43.019> reason<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.590> call

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
the g-spot and the reason that we call

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.849 
the g-spot and the reason that we call
it<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.040> g-spot<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.730> because<00:03:45.590> marker<00:03:46.590> floats

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
it the g-spot is because marker floats

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.159 
it the g-spot is because marker floats
are<00:03:47.069> used<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:48.030> find<00:03:48.239> those<00:03:48.480> little<00:03:48.690> sweet

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
are used to find those little sweet

are used to find those little sweet
spots<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> swim<00:03:50.160> where<00:03:50.790> you're<00:03:50.910> going<00:03:51.030> to
