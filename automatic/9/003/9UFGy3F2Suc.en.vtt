test my own products to see how I can

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.650 
test my own products to see how I can
improve<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:14.849> come<00:00:15.150> up<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.300> new<00:00:15.630> designs

or even teach you new and creative ways
to<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.660> your<00:00:18.690> flash<00:00:19.970> speed<00:00:20.970> light<00:00:21.150> flashes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to use your flash speed light flashes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.790 
to use your flash speed light flashes
more<00:00:21.840> effectively

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
more effectively

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.680 
more effectively
I<00:00:22.830> also<00:00:23.250> test<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> other<00:00:24.029> products<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.600> are

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
I also test the other products that are

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.929 
I also test the other products that are
out<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.020> market<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
out on the market to see how they do and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.580 
out on the market to see how they do and
one<00:00:27.600> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> things<00:00:27.900> I'd<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> share<00:00:28.470> with

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
one of the things I'd like to share with

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.529 
one of the things I'd like to share with
you<00:00:28.710> today<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> results<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> my

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you today is the results of some of my

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
you today is the results of some of my
tests<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.680> I've<00:00:31.800> done<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.250> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
tests now what I've done in this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.510 
tests now what I've done in this
laboratory<00:00:32.730> test<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.230> model

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
laboratory test is I have the model

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
laboratory test is I have the model
triggering<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.790> optical<00:00:36.510> remote<00:00:36.809> control

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
triggering an optical remote control

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.229 
triggering an optical remote control
that<00:00:37.710> fires<00:00:38.130> not<00:00:38.460> only<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> camera<00:00:39.090> that's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that fires not only the camera that's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
that fires not only the camera that's
taking<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.660> picture<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> her<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> second

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
taking the picture of her but a second

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
taking the picture of her but a second
camera<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.700> wide-angle<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> shows<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
camera that's wide-angle that shows the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
camera that's wide-angle that shows the
lighting<00:00:43.559> pattern<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.130> that<00:00:44.700> speed<00:00:45.030> light<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
lighting pattern of that speed light and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
lighting pattern of that speed light and
how<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> directs<00:00:46.230> light<00:00:46.469> toward<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> subject

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
how it directs light toward the subject

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
how it directs light toward the subject
now<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> things<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
now one of the things that we want to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.610 
now one of the things that we want to
look<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.140> any<00:00:52.320> shadow

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
look for is to see if there's any shadow

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
look for is to see if there's any shadow
behind<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> subject<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> shadow<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
behind the subject because the shadow is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
behind the subject because the shadow is
a<00:00:54.600> telltale<00:00:55.170> sign<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> call

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
a telltale sign of what I call

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
a telltale sign of what I call
directional<00:00:57.000> lighting<00:00:57.239> directional

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
directional lighting directional

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
directional lighting directional
lighting<00:00:58.440> means<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.219> harsh<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.000> like

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
lighting means that it's harsh it's like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
lighting means that it's harsh it's like
a<00:01:00.300> flash<00:01:00.629> light<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.289> therefore<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.190> casts<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
a flash light and therefore it casts a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.759 
a flash light and therefore it casts a
shadow<00:01:02.610> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.289> directional<00:01:04.289> lighting<00:01:04.469> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
shadow on the directional lighting is

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
shadow on the directional lighting is
very<00:01:04.859> soft<00:01:05.369> lighting<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.149> like<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.329> cloudy

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
very soft lighting just like a cloudy

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.559 
very soft lighting just like a cloudy
day<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.259> that's<00:01:07.709> what<00:01:07.889> the<00:01:07.979> light<00:01:08.189> sphere

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
day and that's what the light sphere

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.279 
day and that's what the light sphere
delivers<00:01:09.569> that's<00:01:09.779> why<00:01:09.899> it's<00:01:10.020> called<00:01:10.139> the

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
delivers that's why it's called the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.859 
delivers that's why it's called the
sphere<00:01:10.649> in<00:01:11.069> fact<00:01:11.429> the<00:01:11.639> inspiration<00:01:12.569> for<00:01:12.749> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sphere in fact the inspiration for this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
sphere in fact the inspiration for this
was<00:01:13.139> the<00:01:13.289> lampshade<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.459> you'll<00:01:14.789> notice<00:01:15.060> when

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
was the lampshade but you'll notice when

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.849 
was the lampshade but you'll notice when
you're<00:01:15.359> in<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> room<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> lampshade<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.679> a

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
you're in a room with a lampshade that a

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.469 
you're in a room with a lampshade that a
lot<00:01:17.069> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.249> light<00:01:17.429> goes<00:01:17.700> completely<00:01:17.999> around

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lot of the light goes completely around

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
lot of the light goes completely around
the<00:01:18.749> room<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> nobody<00:01:19.709> has<00:01:20.069> a<00:01:20.099> shadow<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the room and nobody has a shadow and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.219 
the room and nobody has a shadow and
that's<00:01:21.270> why<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.689> we're<00:01:21.840> looking<00:01:21.929> at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that's why when we're looking at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.459 
that's why when we're looking at
photographs<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.189> people<00:01:23.869> inside<00:01:24.869> interiors

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
photographs of people inside interiors

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.769 
photographs of people inside interiors
you<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.219> have<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.609> look<00:01:26.849> just<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.389> you

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:27.779 
you want to have it look just like you

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:29.659 
you want to have it look just like you
would<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> room<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> regular

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:29.669 
would in a room with just the regular

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:31.209 
would in a room with just the regular
lighting<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.419> what<00:01:30.599> the<00:01:30.689> light<00:01:30.869> sphere

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
lighting that's what the light sphere

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.429 
lighting that's what the light sphere
accomplishes<00:01:32.219> so<00:01:32.969> one<00:01:33.329> another<00:01:33.959> thing<00:01:34.229> too<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
accomplishes so one another thing too is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
accomplishes so one another thing too is
right<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.219> here<00:01:35.789> I've<00:01:35.969> actually<00:01:36.599> put<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> link

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
right up here I've actually put a link

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.169 
right up here I've actually put a link
to<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.950> actual<00:01:38.099> gallery<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.029> can

to the actual gallery so you can

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.050 
to the actual gallery so you can
download<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> photographs<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.639> look<00:01:41.849> at<00:01:41.969> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
download the photographs and look at the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.779 
download the photographs and look at the
exit<00:01:42.419> data<00:01:42.599> to<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.709> shutter<00:01:44.310> speed<00:01:44.579> what
