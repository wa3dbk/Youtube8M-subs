00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.800
 I have many crazy things you see in the 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.800
 films 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.430
 Now being a pilot requires much more 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 that you just sit in a car and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.150
 hit it hard 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.900
 and there are many aspects that are not seen in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.090
 a video game that you have to consider 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.059
 because it's not just your life but that of the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.059
 fanatical spectators and even passengers 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.620
 as the mental aspects the 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.300
 concentration psychological preparation 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 to the changes of emotions and the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.740
 adrenaline that once it takes over 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.740
 your body do not think about anything 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
 I try to sleep well the night before 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 I try to rest well I try not to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.690
 have pressures when I'm going to enter the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.190
 car deal with before being inside 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.960
 of the automobile you see everything that is 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.100
 going to get to the line I like 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 see how the lanes are 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.390
 and say the video games did somebody 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 as first ahead I concentrate myself 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 amount in water water I close my eyes and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.149
 all all all sensors the lever 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.719
 of parachutes because I have to be 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.719
 all right 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 and the physical aspects that between one of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.230
 things help you withstand the force 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.220
 what is the force the force that is the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.530
 term that is used to describe the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.050
 speed or acceleration not 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.380
 necessarily measure any kind of 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.380
 force 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.300
 in preparation for the event always 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 check the car 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.540
 the maintenance also the pei of this 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.040
 vertical night as suspension 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.040
 all that is already part of a routine 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 Well, there they have some details and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 aspects that are required to be 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.630
 pilots I will put them into practice in 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.730
 testing streets and we stay here in 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.730
 where in mex racing 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.630
 do not 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.590
 i
