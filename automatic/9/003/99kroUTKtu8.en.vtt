Lumosity<00:00:22.740> something<00:00:23.550> along<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> lines<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
Lumosity something along the lines of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.900 
Lumosity something along the lines of
that<00:00:24.180> i<00:00:24.240> guess<00:00:28.369> but<00:00:29.369> i<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.760> it's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that i guess but i don't know it's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.840 
that i guess but i don't know it's
pretty<00:00:30.060> easy<00:00:30.710> um<00:00:32.899> okay<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
pretty easy um okay it's kind of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.830 
pretty easy um okay it's kind of
glitching<00:00:39.410> all<00:00:40.410> right<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.540> tells<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
glitching all right and it tells you the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.400 
glitching all right and it tells you the
order<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> games<00:00:45.170> basically<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
order of the games basically what you

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.970 

actually<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.149> doing<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.390> good<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:58.050> I

every match I played I've won so far so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
every match I played I've won so far so
I<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:10.470> how<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.860> works<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.520> why

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
I know how this works I don't know why

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.039 
I know how this works I don't know why
they<00:01:11.850> should<00:01:12.060> usually<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> circle

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
they should usually be like a circle

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.620 
they should usually be like a circle
around<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> two<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.330> pictures<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
around the two and then the pictures of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
around the two and then the pictures of
the<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.500> games<00:01:17.479> basically<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.840> need

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the little games basically this one need

be it for this video my rank is pretty
good<00:02:51.020> as<00:02:51.380> far<00:02:51.530> as<00:02:51.770> I'm<00:02:51.890> concerned<00:02:51.920> there's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
good as far as I'm concerned there's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.190 
good as far as I'm concerned there's
like<00:02:52.880> lots<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.420> people<00:02:53.630> who<00:02:53.720> played<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.930> game

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
like lots of people who played the game

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.449 
like lots of people who played the game
so<00:02:56.050> does<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.200> same<00:02:57.410> thing<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.920> might<00:02:58.070> n<00:02:58.220> equals

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
so does the same thing I might n equals

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.460 
so does the same thing I might n equals
out<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.000> open<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.330> up<00:02:59.480> again<00:03:02.470> what

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
out of it and open it up again what

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.600 
out of it and open it up again what
simplicity<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> math<00:03:05.750> one<00:03:05.930> okay

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
simplicity it's just the math one okay

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.840 
simplicity it's just the math one okay
this<00:03:07.610> basic<00:03:08.000> math<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.480> got<00:03:08.600> answer<00:03:08.870> that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850

like in a zone I guess never i'm playing
games<00:03:20.000> like<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.360> like<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> competition<00:03:21.380> mode

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
games like this like a competition mode

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:31.210 
games like this like a competition mode
and<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.239> kind<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.450> weird<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:27.910> whatever<00:03:30.220> won

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and it's kind of weird but whatever won

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.860 

look<00:03:40.780> at<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.020> one<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.230> haven't<00:03:41.410> paid<00:03:41.530> yet<00:03:42.870> okay

look at this one I haven't paid yet okay

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.500 
look at this one I haven't paid yet okay
that<00:03:44.020> makes<00:03:44.050> sense<00:03:44.610> x<00:03:45.610> not<00:03:45.820> color<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.360> that

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
that makes sense x not color but that

00:03:46.510 --> 00:04:07.310 
that makes sense x not color but that
makes<00:03:46.660> sense

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.320 

one<00:04:08.320> again<00:04:08.590> okay<00:04:08.980> that's<00:04:09.910> my<00:04:10.000> first<00:04:10.210> time

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
trying that one so all right what's this

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.030 
trying that one so all right what's this
one<00:04:21.340> going<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.549> be<00:04:21.670> 0<00:04:22.380> floating<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.800> bird

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
one going to be 0 floating and it's bird

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.980 
one going to be 0 floating and it's bird
watching<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.730> this<00:04:25.420> way<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.600> was<00:04:25.720> able<00:04:25.780> to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.500 
me open it up and see what happened to
my<00:04:46.330> grant<00:04:46.600> go<00:04:46.750> down<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:48.300> hope<00:04:49.300> that's<00:04:49.420> not

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
my grant go down I hope that's not

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.560 
my grant go down I hope that's not
considered<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:50.080> loss<00:04:50.260> because<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.680> didn't<00:04:51.570> it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
considered a loss because I didn't it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.970 
considered a loss because I didn't it
doesn't<00:04:52.840> look<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.110> anything<00:04:53.590> happened

really<00:04:55.200> well<00:04:56.200> okay<00:05:00.360> let's<00:05:01.360> do<00:05:01.540> one<00:05:01.780> more<00:05:01.810> thing

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
really well okay let's do one more thing

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.130 
really well okay let's do one more thing
since<00:05:02.620> i<00:05:02.830> got<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:04.330> disqualified<00:05:05.110> or

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
since i got like disqualified or

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.760 
since i got like disqualified or
something<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.680> guess<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:06.520> someone<00:05:06.970> pretty<00:05:07.300> good

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
something I guess do someone pretty good

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.310 
something I guess do someone pretty good
they<00:05:08.770> rank<00:05:09.240> about<00:05:10.240> equal<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.690> me<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.110> that's

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
they rank about equal to me so that's

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.830 
they rank about equal to me so that's
nice<00:05:11.760> see<00:05:12.760> this<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.120> circle<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.660> stuff

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
nice see this is the circle and stuff

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.260 
nice see this is the circle and stuff
that's<00:05:14.020> supposed<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.350> show<00:05:14.880> shows<00:05:15.880> like<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.090> bar

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
that's supposed to show shows like a bar

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
that's supposed to show shows like a bar
the<00:05:16.419> top<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.720> see<00:05:16.840> how<00:05:16.960> good<00:05:17.110> you're<00:05:17.260> doing
