00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello to all and morgane 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.330
 so find again to talk about 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 loot and this time of our second 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.200
 day of louds on trias fauzy risso 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.419
 more exactly others second 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.669
 session finally we did one that a 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.200
 only attempt is so it was this 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.119
 this time for me with the titan to 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.860
 impulses with the hunter tries to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 again with the hunter in threshold that he 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.700
 had this little bad that made it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 did not have the series of nine wins on 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.270
 again had a little bit of 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.129
 misfortune in quotation marks after that is to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
 we better play than we did 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.670
 an egg 1 which is pretty good 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 after doing a 9-0 did a 9-1 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.770
 I was pretty happy with our 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.210
 teams of course and so we were able to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 of course open all packages 1 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 to the hills 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.130
 gold again with the disciple of osiris 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.079
 that's what is important anyway and 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.579
 after we manage to redo the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 nh90 of stroke with this character for 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 have the mercury chest and so we have 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.320
 added of course stop them with the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 access tokens that's pretty classic 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 we could buy the torsos I could 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.799
 buy the torso for monty time in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.950
 osiris colors both of them both 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.240
 hunters also tasted the torso 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.859
 of hunters there in August is at stake and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.719
 then they could buy it too a cd 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.149
 different torso in August stadiums 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.740
 different issues and what can 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.479
 buy from the disciple of osiris he 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.069
 are two sets in fact of osiris stuff 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 this also added the boots of 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.619
 hunter from elsewhere and then at the level 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 weapons 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.859
 I had the scout the scholar so 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.359
 I was very happy with a rap 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.999
 I like this type of weapons hatches them 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.069
 and the impulses and I find it rather 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.020
 cool it can be interesting since 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.909
 has off-the-law and reactive reload 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.350
 so he can recharge quickly and he 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.119
 inflicts more damage after being 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 recharged so it can be nice 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.599
 knowing that he made 13 bullets in the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.849
 loader but suddenly it may not 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.799
 to be such a big inconvenience 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.959
 I prefer them and clark have a lot of 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.240
 badly but it may have gone well I did 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.939
 want to try that and then urges had 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.649
 the curse fusion of exile and that he 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.270
 had fire version so of course a 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.829
 fusion rifle it's a little bit more 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.749
 anecdotal but at least that you 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580
 lets see the merger what is it 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.810
 that they look like he has particular a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.720
 improvement in shooting at the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.069
 hip after attested it can be 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.780
 interesting but it's true that we 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.819
 in our team we do not play 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.550
 mergers but it's always pleasant 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.770
 to have a trial of osiris weapon in 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.030
 plus one of course so suddenly we will 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 will have noticed that I had played my bow 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.270
 analysts yesterday i played my titan 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.580
 today I say today because 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.300
 I record this video during the night 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.130
 between saturday and sunday and that suddenly 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.410
 this sunday we will you the day you 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.940
 will see this video of the game I will play 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.500
 the hunter which will allow to have 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.660
 played the three characters and have 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.770
 open the parcels with the three characters 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.780
 then we'll see 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.190
 to complete the series of nine 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.170
 victories without defeat 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.760
 if possible to just open 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 also the other two chests on 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.570
 mercury and have chances of the host 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 expert weapons and expert versions 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.320
 interesting trial weapons choose 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.370
 that's nice enough elsewhere 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.480
 aspect there 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.430
 so here I am hoping to find you 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 very quickly to show you again 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.970
 loot and by then we find ourselves of course 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.970
 on the channel and on the stream
