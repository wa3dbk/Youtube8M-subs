hat and this is one of the situations

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
hat and this is one of the situations
where<00:01:22.860> engineer<00:01:23.460> becomes<00:01:23.850> amazing<00:01:24.720> when

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
where engineer becomes amazing when

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
where engineer becomes amazing when
you're<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:25.799> using<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> black<00:01:26.369> hat<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you're when using the black hat you can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.270 
you're when using the black hat you can
point<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.270> directly<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> sentry<00:01:28.500> gun<00:01:28.680> or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
point it directly at the sentry gun or

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.330 
point it directly at the sentry gun or
guardian<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> wall<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.200> directly<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
guardian through a wall or directly and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
guardian through a wall or directly and
it<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.270> destroy<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> over<00:01:33.960> time<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.409> do

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it will destroy it over time you can do

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
it will destroy it over time you can do
this<00:01:34.799> through<00:01:35.130> walls<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.390> reasonable

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this through walls and over reasonable

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.969 
this through walls and over reasonable
distance<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> only<00:01:37.409> drawback<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
distance the only drawback is that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.499 
distance the only drawback is that
you're<00:01:38.159> most<00:01:38.340> likely<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.060> exposed

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you're most likely going to be exposed

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
you're most likely going to be exposed
and<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:40.320> easy<00:01:40.470> target<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.310> least<00:01:41.490> you're

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and an easy target but at least you're

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
and an easy target but at least you're
not<00:01:41.880> standing<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> middle<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> open

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
long as you know exactly where the UAV

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.190 
long as you know exactly where the UAV
is<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:32.150> since<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.360> black<00:04:33.540> cat<00:04:33.750> can<00:04:33.900> do<00:04:33.990> so

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
is and since the black cat can do so

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.630 
is and since the black cat can do so
much<00:04:34.320> more<00:04:34.380> than<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.770> launcher<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.490> better

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
much more than a launcher it's a better

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.980 
much more than a launcher it's a better
choice<00:04:35.910> unless<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.480> want<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.690> take<00:04:36.840> out

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
choice unless you want to take out

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.990 
choice unless you want to take out
something<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.530> large<00:04:37.770> kill<00:04:38.100> streak<00:04:38.370> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
something like a large kill streak the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.240 
something like a large kill streak the
black<00:04:39.240> hat<00:04:39.450> can<00:04:39.660> take<00:04:39.840> out<00:04:39.990> almost<00:04:40.500> or<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:41.100> can

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
black hat can take out almost or it can

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.590 
black hat can take out almost or it can
take<00:04:41.460> out<00:04:41.580> any<00:04:41.760> kill<00:04:41.970> streak<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.420> can

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
take out any kill streak that you can

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.380 
take out any kill streak that you can
see<00:04:42.810> for<00:04:43.680> example<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:44.190> take<00:04:44.340> out<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.580> AGR<00:04:45.060> with

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
see for example it take out the AGR with

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.390 
see for example it take out the AGR with
one<00:04:45.570> black<00:04:45.780> hat<00:04:46.020> but<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.320> takes<00:04:46.500> two<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:47.190> take

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
one black hat but it takes two to take

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.670 
one black hat but it takes two to take
out<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> chopper<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.260> other<00:04:49.350> side<00:04:49.650> of

that coin the Loadstar in the VTOL
warship<00:04:51.960> takes<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.860> many<00:04:53.010> black<00:04:53.370> hats<00:04:53.670> that<00:04:53.970> is

warship takes so many black hats that is
that<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.510> an<00:04:54.660> unreasonable<00:04:55.350> tactic<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.250> trying

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
that is an unreasonable tactic of trying

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.740 
that is an unreasonable tactic of trying
to<00:04:56.670> destroy<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.180> unless<00:04:57.450> your<00:04:57.570> whole

is<00:05:00.030> definitely<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.510> way<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.600> go<00:05:00.720> if<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.050> want
