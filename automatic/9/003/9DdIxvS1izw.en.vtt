broke it down slowly it starts off on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.089 
broke it down slowly it starts off on
the<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> e<00:00:23.699> F<00:00:24.600> sharp<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.320> these<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> four

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the a e F sharp a these are the four

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.910 
the a e F sharp a these are the four
keys<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.119> using<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> first

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
keys are going to be using it first

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:44.600 
keys are going to be using it first
start<00:00:28.920> simply<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> AEA<00:00:30.019> like<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:43.610> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
start simply on the AEA like this so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
start simply on the AEA like this so
these<00:00:44.789> four<00:00:45.120> f-sharp<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
these four f-sharp back to the a and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.150 
these four f-sharp back to the a and
then<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> E<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> F<00:00:47.670> sharp<00:00:47.700> together<00:00:52.160> next

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then the E and the F sharp together next

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.869 
then the E and the F sharp together next
part<00:00:56.420> these<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.629> again<00:00:58.160> then<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.309> roll<00:00:59.609> down

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
part these two again then we roll down

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.750 
part these two again then we roll down
through<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> D<00:01:01.530> seven<00:01:02.219> nine<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> B

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
through the D seven nine which is the B

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:20.120 
through the D seven nine which is the B
in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> e<00:01:11.570> again<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> speed<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:19.130> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
in the e again so if you speed it up so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
in the e again so if you speed it up so
far<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:26.299> again<00:01:33.049> next<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.290> come<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:34.619> here

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
far we have again next we come down here

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.200 
far we have again next we come down here
to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.250> D<00:01:35.490> E<00:01:35.900> C<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> we're<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> roll

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to the D E C and we're going to roll

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.550 
to the D E C and we're going to roll
once<00:01:39.479> again<00:01:39.890> through<00:01:40.890> another<00:01:41.390> d7<00:01:42.390> 9<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
once again through another d7 9 this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.510 
once again through another d7 9 this
time<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.070> play<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.490> three<00:01:44.759> notes<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.520> roll

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
time we play these three notes and roll

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:58.060 
time we play these three notes and roll
with<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> f-sharp<00:01:48.630> roll<00:01:49.290> down<00:01:57.049> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
with the a and the f-sharp roll down and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.010 
with the a and the f-sharp roll down and
the<00:01:59.070> last<00:01:59.280> few<00:01:59.549> notes<00:01:59.790> will<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.259> D

that's the first half second half

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.120 
that's the first half second half
similar<00:02:21.910> not<00:02:22.180> quite<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> same<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.110> little<00:02:23.890> bit

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
similar not quite the same a little bit

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.670 
similar not quite the same a little bit
different<00:02:30.690> these<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.959> melody<00:02:32.200> notes<00:02:32.470> up

different these are the melody notes up
here<00:02:36.930> played<00:02:37.930> with<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.610> octave<00:02:44.459> one<00:02:45.459> more

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.280 

then<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:51.010> get<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.819> rolling<00:02:52.090> again<00:02:52.480> we'll<00:02:53.170> get

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
then we get to rolling again we'll get

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.400 
then we get to rolling again we'll get
there<00:02:53.530> by<00:02:53.680> doing<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.640> e<00:02:55.230> f-sharp<00:02:56.230> together

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
there by doing this e f-sharp together

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.050 
there by doing this e f-sharp together
and<00:02:59.410> these<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.250> again<00:03:00.989> which<00:03:01.989> leads<00:03:02.290> us<00:03:02.500> into

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and these two again which leads us into

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.170 
and these two again which leads us into
our<00:03:04.060> next<00:03:04.660> role<00:03:05.170> once<00:03:05.860> again<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.130> d7<00:03:06.610> 9<00:03:06.910> role

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
our next role once again a d7 9 role

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.060 
our next role once again a d7 9 role
instead<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.989> like<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:08.230> did<00:03:08.380> last<00:03:08.530> time<00:03:08.830> which

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
instead of like we did last time which

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.289 
instead of like we did last time which
was<00:03:11.070> almost<00:03:12.070> it's<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.959> minor<00:03:14.470> triad<00:03:15.299> these

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
was almost it's the a minor triad these

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:27.470 
was almost it's the a minor triad these
three<00:03:16.690> we're<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.650> roll<00:03:17.890> downward<00:03:24.480> so

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
three we're going to roll downward so

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.979 
three we're going to roll downward so
and<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:29.430> trip<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.579> e<00:03:30.609> with<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.000> E<00:03:31.120> flat<00:03:33.989> just

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
and we trip the e with the E flat just

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:43.020 
and we trip the e with the E flat just
on<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> second<00:03:35.650> time<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.489> far<00:03:42.760> in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
on the second time so we have so far in

on the second time so we have so far in
the<00:03:43.120> second<00:03:43.510> half<00:03:48.959> now<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.470> head<00:03:50.889> toward

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
the second half now as we head toward

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.620 
the second half now as we head toward
the<00:03:51.220> end<00:03:51.400> once<00:03:51.880> again<00:03:52.209> d<00:03:52.630> e<00:03:53.160> C<00:03:54.450> we're<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.480> to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the end once again d e C we're going to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.490 
the end once again d e C we're going to
roll<00:03:55.810> through<00:03:56.049> another<00:03:56.319> d7<00:03:57.040> 9<00:03:58.290> same<00:03:59.290> one<00:03:59.470> that

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
roll through another d7 9 same one that

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.039 
roll through another d7 9 same one that
we<00:03:59.680> did<00:03:59.859> before<00:04:00.180> with<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.900> f-sharp

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
we did before with the a and the f-sharp

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.810 
we did before with the a and the f-sharp
down<00:04:02.680> first<00:04:03.519> these<00:04:03.730> three<00:04:04.000> notes<00:04:04.680> roll<00:04:05.680> down

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:19.660 

then<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:11.650> D<00:04:12.650> major<00:04:12.860> triad<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.049> C<00:04:18.430> with<00:04:19.430> these

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
then a D major triad to the C with these

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.290 
then a D major triad to the C with these
three<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:22.220> ends<00:04:22.610> on<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:23.140> GAE<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:26.120> then

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
three and it ends on the GAE and then

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.640 
three and it ends on the GAE and then
Billy<00:04:26.540> Preston<00:04:27.200> ends<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.770> with<00:04:29.080> these<00:04:30.080> three<00:04:30.440> F

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
Billy Preston ends it with these three F

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:44.050 
Billy Preston ends it with these three F
E<00:04:31.370> flat<00:04:31.550> E<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.710> again<00:04:42.760> that's<00:04:43.760> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
E flat E and a so so again that's the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:05:02.140 
E flat E and a so so again that's the
end<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:45.250> last<00:04:46.250> part<00:04:46.610> again<00:04:58.900> that's<00:04:59.900> it
