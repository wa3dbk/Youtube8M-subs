hello buddy my nose made chalen suggests

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.460 
hello buddy my nose made chalen suggests
and<00:00:02.490> we're<00:00:03.120> doing<00:00:03.270> minecraft<00:00:03.870> Trudy<00:00:04.170> again

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
and we're doing minecraft Trudy again

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.010 
and we're doing minecraft Trudy again
because<00:00:04.950> it's<00:00:05.400> amazingly<00:00:06.150> popular<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.870> all

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
because it's amazingly popular with all

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.350 
because it's amazingly popular with all
its<00:00:07.220> amazing<00:00:08.220> lighting<00:00:08.460> mechanics<00:00:09.120> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
its amazing lighting mechanics and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.860 
its amazing lighting mechanics and
during<00:00:09.780> terrain<00:00:10.740> generation<00:00:10.950> mechanics<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.570> i

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
during terrain generation mechanics so i

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.839 
during terrain generation mechanics so i
thought<00:00:13.530> i'd<00:00:13.710> show<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.099> i<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.490> done

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
thought i'd show you what i have done

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.290 
thought i'd show you what i have done
and<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.650> saw<00:00:16.859> been<00:00:17.670> working<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.150> i

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and as you just saw been working on it i

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
and as you just saw been working on it i
added<00:00:19.400> block<00:00:20.400> breaking<00:00:21.060> timers<00:00:21.689> things<00:00:22.820> so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
added block breaking timers things so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269 
added block breaking timers things so
now<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> takes<00:00:24.150> time<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.510> break<00:00:24.930> blocks<00:00:25.279> that's

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
now it takes time to break blocks that's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.820 
now it takes time to break blocks that's
a<00:00:26.460> good<00:00:26.640> thing<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.869> game's<00:00:28.080> progression

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a good thing in the game's progression

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950 
a good thing in the game's progression
but<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.730> bad<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.599> takes<00:00:30.750> me

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
but it's bad thing because it takes me

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.799 
but it's bad thing because it takes me
so<00:00:30.990> much<00:00:31.349> longer<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.130> show<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.030> guys<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so much longer to show you guys all the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
so much longer to show you guys all the
new<00:00:33.930> features<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> we're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> dig<00:00:36.210> up

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
new features so we're going to dig up

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
new features so we're going to dig up
dirt<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.469> absolutely

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
dirt because that is absolutely

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639 
dirt because that is absolutely
pointless<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.420> need<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.110> dig<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
pointless but we need to dig it up to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
pointless but we need to dig it up to
get<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> these<00:00:41.070> trees<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> dig

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
get to these trees so I'm going to dig

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
get to these trees so I'm going to dig
up<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> trees<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:43.079> yes<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.460> dig<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.789> trees

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
up the trees now yes you do dig up trees

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
up the trees now yes you do dig up trees
in<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:46.230> game<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.620> least<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.809> blocks

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
in this game at least so the blocks

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340 
in this game at least so the blocks
break<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.280> different<00:00:50.579> times<00:00:51.079> saplings<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.199> not

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
break at different times saplings do not

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.830 
break at different times saplings do not
drop<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.800> leaves<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.399> don't<00:00:53.730> attempt<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> get

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
drop from leaves so don't attempt to get

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
drop from leaves so don't attempt to get
saplings<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.410> leaves<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.100> doesn't

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
saplings from leaves because doesn't

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.369 
saplings from leaves because doesn't
work<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.020> we're<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> make

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
work right now but we're going to make

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
work right now but we're going to make
some<00:00:58.440> sticks<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> we're<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.510> make

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
some sticks and we're going to make

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.560 
some sticks and we're going to make
ourselves<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.469> crafting<00:01:02.100> bench<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.210> we've<00:01:03.359> got

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
ourselves a crafting bench and we've got

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
ourselves a crafting bench and we've got
one<00:01:03.870> crafting<00:01:04.379> bench<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> place<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
one crafting bench I'm going to place it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750 
one crafting bench I'm going to place it
down<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.420> where<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.320> spawned<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.580> where

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
down here where we spawned or not where

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.350 
down here where we spawned or not where
we<00:01:08.850> spawn<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
we spawn and we are going to make a

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
we spawn and we are going to make a
pickaxe<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> obviously<00:01:14.100> pickaxes<00:01:14.909> come

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
pickaxe so obviously pickaxes come

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.929 
pickaxe so obviously pickaxes come
hand-in-hand<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> block<00:01:16.200> timers<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
hand-in-hand to the block timers so the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.850 
hand-in-hand to the block timers so the
pickaxe<00:01:18.330> increases<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> takes<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
pickaxe increases how long it takes to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.660 
pickaxe increases how long it takes to
mine<00:01:20.520> stone<00:01:21.119> by<00:01:21.540> quite<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.460> dig

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
mine stone by quite a bit so if we dig

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
mine stone by quite a bit so if we dig
down<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.600> actually<00:01:24.630> make<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> shovel<00:01:25.530> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
down here will actually make a shovel so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.760 
down here will actually make a shovel so
that<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.810> quicker<00:01:28.640> shovel<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that is quicker shovel and we have a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
that is quicker shovel and we have a
shovel<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.000> looks<00:01:33.180> weird<00:01:33.360> but

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
shovel and that just looks weird but

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
shovel and that just looks weird but
regardless<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.240> taking

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
regardless you can see it's not taking

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
regardless you can see it's not taking
any<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.900> near<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.049> long<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.759> break<00:01:38.759> blocks

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
any where near as long to break blocks

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.950 
any where near as long to break blocks
and<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.009> dig<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.100> stone<00:01:41.960> normal

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and we're going to dig our stone normal

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.280 
and we're going to dig our stone normal
hand<00:01:43.170> digging<00:01:43.590> takes<00:01:44.310> forever<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:46.020> unlike

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hand digging takes forever but unlike

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.609 
hand digging takes forever but unlike
minecraft<00:01:46.939> still<00:01:47.939> drops<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> block<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.409> saw

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
minecraft still drops a block if you saw

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 
minecraft still drops a block if you saw
it<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.860> added<00:01:50.430> cobblestone<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it I added cobblestone up there if you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.109 
it I added cobblestone up there if you
can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.259> my<00:01:52.350> inventory<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.850> cold

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
can see it in my inventory and this cold

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.899 
can see it in my inventory and this cold
stone<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.780> used<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.380> craft<00:01:55.649> better<00:01:56.640> tools

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
stone can be used to craft better tools

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
stone can be used to craft better tools
so<00:01:57.450> we'll<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:57.960> some<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.380> tools<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:59.070> don't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so we'll make some better tools we don't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.539 
so we'll make some better tools we don't
have<00:01:59.369> any<00:01:59.520> sticks<00:01:59.790> left<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.290> more<00:02:01.500> sticks<00:02:01.770> are

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
have any sticks left so more sticks are

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.749 
have any sticks left so more sticks are

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and I pick up this and we can finally

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.020 
and I pick up this and we can finally
see<00:03:35.250> what<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> furnace<00:03:35.790> does<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.470> can<00:03:38.160> stop

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
see what the furnace does so I can stop

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.879 
see what the furnace does so I can stop
talking<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.769> okay<00:03:41.629> so<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.139> just<00:03:43.590> found<00:03:43.739> a

going to have to fix the bug you can see

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.339 
going to have to fix the bug you can see
the<00:03:50.519> frame<00:03:50.760> rates<00:03:50.970> bit<00:03:51.180> low<00:03:51.359> right<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.690> that's

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
the frame rates bit low right now that's

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.589 
the frame rates bit low right now that's
not<00:03:52.829> because<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.720> can't<00:03:54.720> jump<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.310> there

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
not because of can't jump on the there

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.869 
not because of can't jump on the there
that's<00:03:57.599> not<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.260> game<00:03:58.470> that's<00:03:58.680> just

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
that's not because the game that's just

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.610 
that's not because the game that's just
perhaps<00:03:59.879> being<00:04:00.239> fraps<00:04:00.629> as<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.260> does<00:04:01.489> yeah<00:04:03.620> now

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
perhaps being fraps as it does yeah now

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.580 
perhaps being fraps as it does yeah now
we'll<00:04:04.769> go<00:04:04.799> in<00:04:05.069> here<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.579> we<00:04:06.510> will<00:04:06.660> use<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.169> wood

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
and I'll I n so by cooking the arrow

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.089 
and I'll I n so by cooking the arrow
goes<00:04:14.310> backwards<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.540> time<00:04:15.810> being<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.949> I'll
