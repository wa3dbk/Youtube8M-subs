said well medicated two balls and header
in<00:00:45.829> but<00:00:46.829> moving<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:48.030> me<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.480> found<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
in but moving on for me I found in was a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
in but moving on for me I found in was a
great<00:00:50.579> player<00:00:50.820> he<00:00:51.090> took<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.629> time<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
great player he took some time to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
great player he took some time to
showing<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.649> though<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.030> first<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
showing it first though of the first I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200 
showing it first though of the first I
think<00:00:54.780> he<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:54.930> 23<00:00:55.320> games<00:00:55.789> isn't<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
