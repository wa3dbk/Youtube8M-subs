00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 in Nizhny Novgorod a dozen people 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.180
 tried to save 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 yard cat he wanted to climb the basement but 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.240
 stuck in a very small gap under 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 by stairs 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 but it would seem to get the poor fellow just 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.949
 impossible right during the rescue 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 operations the animal was exhausted and ceased 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.699
 resist but as our found out 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.189
 correspondent Sergey Tyurin 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 this cat has really many lives 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 porch favorite lies in a pool of blood 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.529
 around the shreds of muzzle fur 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.969
 one can see the first thought of some tenants 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.570
 the monsters beheaded the unfortunate animal 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.640
 can take attention then I have not heard 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 but soon it turns out the head is intact just 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 out of curiosity or from hunger poor fellow 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 put his nose in the wrong place 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 apparently the cat chased the prey 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 however, lunch escaped the pursuer 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 in the basement, the predator thrust itself into a narrow crack under 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 the ladder stuck remains only 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 guess what felt like poor 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.880
 animal when his body was wrapped in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.450
 a rag and a red-hot sprinkled on his neck 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450
 concrete crumb 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.219
 suddenly the code stops breaking free 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.750
 tenants they are forced to take a break a 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.880
 some are ready to deliver 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.039
 body point rescue operations 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 the animal is removed from the trap code is not 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.850
 gives no sign of life yet 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.759
 after a few seconds makes his 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 the first after inhalation inhale the eyes 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 open until open but come on 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.720
 miracle despite happy ending 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 residents of the entrance, too, barely holding back 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.380
 tears now they have to put 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.840
 animals on their feet to help them in this seems 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.909
 all the inhabitants of the house are going to a hole in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.770
 basement local janitor promised to seal 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.039
 Sergey Tyurin emergency call 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.679
 and once again I want to say that everything is with the cat 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.709
 ok he is alive and well and has already come in 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.709
