where I am on the map when he spawns up

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.440 
where I am on the map when he spawns up
he<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.079> gonna<00:01:56.320> get<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> bad<00:01:56.799> spawn<00:01:57.159> secure<00:01:58.149> so

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
he is gonna get a bad spawn secure so

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.999 
he is gonna get a bad spawn secure so
he's<00:01:58.990> probably<00:01:59.109> gonna<00:01:59.320> spawn<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.649> right<00:01:59.920> in

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
he's probably gonna spawn like right in

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.709 
he's probably gonna spawn like right in
front<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.310> me<00:02:00.399> somewhere<00:02:00.789> around<00:02:01.119> those<00:02:01.479> lines

are<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.399> little<00:02:06.609> rusty<00:02:06.939> right<00:02:07.119> now<00:02:07.240> but

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.740 

I<00:02:11.650> shot<00:02:12.650> him<00:02:12.739> off<00:02:12.920> though<00:02:13.160> but<00:02:13.640> uh<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.879> little

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
I shot him off though but uh a little

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.110 
I shot him off though but uh a little
sloppy<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.170> my<00:02:15.379> part<00:02:15.620> isn't<00:02:16.580> like<00:02:16.819> my<00:02:16.970> first

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
sloppy on my part isn't like my first

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.800 
sloppy on my part isn't like my first
game<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> day

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
game of the day

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.619 
game of the day
so<00:02:18.970> still<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.269> up<00:02:20.330> he's<00:02:20.450> probably

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
so still gonna want up he's probably

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.479 
so still gonna want up he's probably
gonna<00:02:20.870> go<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> right<00:02:21.349> now<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> believe<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.310> get

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
gonna go a right now I believe I can get

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.729 
gonna go a right now I believe I can get
to<00:02:22.640> probably<00:02:22.819> beat<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.140> could<00:02:24.319> probably

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
to probably beat and I could probably

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.880 
to probably beat and I could probably
nade<00:02:25.220> him<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.750> at<00:02:26.750> least<00:02:27.019> stun<00:02:27.560> him

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
nade him off at least stun him

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.130 
nade him off at least stun him
my<00:02:28.340> name<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:29.209> done<00:02:29.450> I'll<00:02:29.629> probably<00:02:29.810> get<00:02:29.959> that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
my name is done I'll probably get that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.740 
my name is done I'll probably get that
flag<00:02:30.319> though<00:02:30.500> no<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.920> didn't<00:02:31.220> hate<00:02:31.310> him<00:02:31.750> it's

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
flag though no I didn't hate him it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.940 
flag though no I didn't hate him it's
kind<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.959> lucky<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.410> thought<00:02:33.709> he<00:02:33.799> would<00:02:33.920> have

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
kind of lucky I thought he would have

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.500 
kind of lucky I thought he would have
captain<00:02:34.370> time<00:02:34.610> he's<00:02:34.790> probably<00:02:34.849> I'll<00:02:35.239> split

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
captain time he's probably I'll split

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.729 
captain time he's probably I'll split
second<00:02:35.780> away<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.019> he's<00:02:36.140> gonna<00:02:36.230> spawn<00:02:36.530> like

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
second away so he's gonna spawn like

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.979 
second away so he's gonna spawn like
this<00:02:36.920> wall<00:02:37.519> over<00:02:37.819> here<00:02:37.849> I'll<00:02:38.239> flag<00:02:38.450> security

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
this wall over here I'll flag security

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.839 
this wall over here I'll flag security
for<00:02:39.230> positions<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.099> should<00:02:40.310> come<00:02:40.489> right<00:02:40.670> here

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
for positions you should come right here

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.940 
for positions you should come right here
oh<00:02:41.829> maybe<00:02:42.829> he<00:02:43.040> wrapped<00:02:43.220> around<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.549> see<00:02:44.920> yeah<00:02:45.920> I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
oh maybe he wrapped around to see yeah I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.809 
oh maybe he wrapped around to see yeah I
reckon<00:02:46.700> garden<00:02:47.120> wrap<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:48.430> I'm<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:49.610> really

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
reckon garden wrap to see I'm not really

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.699 
reckon garden wrap to see I'm not really
like<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.150> great<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:50.930> spawns<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.560> game

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
like that great with spawns on this game

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.530 
like that great with spawns on this game
100%<00:02:52.130> because<00:02:52.579> I<00:02:52.700> don't<00:02:52.880> play<00:02:53.060> as<00:02:53.180> much<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.420> have

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
100% because I don't play as much I have

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
100% because I don't play as much I have
a<00:02:53.599> general<00:02:54.079> idea<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:54.799> like<00:02:55.069> completely

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
a general idea but not like completely

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.949 
a general idea but not like completely
he's<00:02:58.190> got<00:02:58.310> obviously<00:02:58.700> gonna<00:02:58.819> go<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.269> but

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
he's got obviously gonna go and be but

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.580 
he's got obviously gonna go and be but
I'm<00:03:00.049> gonna<00:03:00.170> trick<00:03:00.440> him<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.700> make<00:03:01.879> him<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:03.940> I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
I'm gonna trick him and make him think I

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.400 
I'm gonna trick him and make him think I
pretty<00:03:06.590> much<00:03:06.709> played<00:03:07.069> him<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.780> took<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.959> while<00:03:09.200> on

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
pretty much played him I took a while on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.900 
pretty much played him I took a while on
purpose<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.010> make<00:03:10.190> him<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:10.579> that<00:03:10.879> I

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
purpose just to make him think that I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.009 
purpose just to make him think that I
was<00:03:11.090> gonna<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.480> other<00:03:11.569> way<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:11.989> I

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
was gonna go the other way just so I

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.539 
was gonna go the other way just so I
could<00:03:12.140> accumulate<00:03:12.500> for<00:03:12.799> like<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.069> time<00:03:13.280> loss

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
could accumulate for like the time loss

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.180 
could accumulate for like the time loss
that<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.209> would<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:14.989> if<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:15.859> was<00:03:15.980> going

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
that I would be if I really was going

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.849 
that I would be if I really was going
down<00:03:16.370> then<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:16.880> stayed<00:03:17.359> around<00:03:17.480> alpha<00:03:18.200> now

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
down then I just stayed around alpha now

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.559 
down then I just stayed around alpha now
I'm<00:03:19.010> probably<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.370> gonna<00:03:19.549> need<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.880> he<00:03:20.450> and

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
I'm probably just gonna need I he and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.729 
I'm probably just gonna need I he and
bump<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.930> he's<00:03:21.049> gonna<00:03:21.139> stay<00:03:21.319> on<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.530> should

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
bump it he's gonna stay on that should

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.930 
bump it he's gonna stay on that should
be<00:03:21.829> an<00:03:21.889> easy<00:03:22.040> kill<00:03:22.280> with<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.639> need<00:03:23.260> yeah<00:03:24.849> so<00:03:25.849> at

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
be an easy kill with a need yeah so at

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.190 
be an easy kill with a need yeah so at
this<00:03:26.030> point<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.359> game<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.690> kind<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.959> getting

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
this point this game is kind of getting

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
this point this game is kind of getting
out<00:03:27.349> of<00:03:27.470> hand<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.829> three<00:03:28.040> there's

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
out of hand have a three there's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.349 
out of hand have a three there's
obviously<00:03:28.489> two<00:03:28.549> sides<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.090> getting<00:03:29.329> out

where you technically don't know where
they<00:04:03.940> are<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.330> gotta<00:04:04.510> just<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> little

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
they are so you gotta just be a little

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.600 
they are so you gotta just be a little
smart<00:04:05.379> sometimes<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:08.200> should<00:04:08.470> spawn<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.310> same

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
smart sometimes it should spawn the same

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.070 
smart sometimes it should spawn the same
area<00:04:09.970> before<00:04:10.269> cuz<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.510> stacked<00:04:10.750> up<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:10.959> this

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
area before cuz I stacked up on this

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.479 
area before cuz I stacked up on this
side<00:04:11.230> sometimes<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:11.709> domination<00:04:12.040> singles<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
side sometimes in domination singles you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.789 
side sometimes in domination singles you
want<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:12.989> stack<00:04:13.989> up<00:04:14.170> on<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.319> certain<00:04:14.590> side

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
want to like stack up on a certain side

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.129 
want to like stack up on a certain side
so<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.129> have<00:04:15.220> like<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.400> losing<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.299> better<00:04:16.780> I

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
so you have like a losing be better I

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:17.939 
so you have like a losing be better I
guess

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
guess

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.219 
guess
position<00:04:18.370> bump<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.940> he<00:04:19.660> kind<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> played<00:04:20.079> me

position bump that he kind of played me
right<00:04:20.320> there<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.709> he<00:04:20.769> bumped<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.130> so

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579

at spawn and especially singles it like

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.300 
at spawn and especially singles it like
messes<00:04:41.860> up<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.160> spawns<00:04:43.740> yeah<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.889> did<00:04:45.039> stun

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
messes up the spawns yeah if I did stun

a killer if you play like a killer

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.040 
a killer if you play like a killer
you're<00:06:55.819> gonna<00:06:56.030> eventually<00:06:56.210> good<00:06:56.720> it's<00:06:56.930> gonna

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
you're gonna eventually good it's gonna

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.469 
you're gonna eventually good it's gonna
catch<00:06:57.259> up<00:06:57.289> to<00:06:57.470> you're<00:06:57.710> gonna<00:06:57.800> lose<00:06:58.039> and<00:06:58.479> then

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
catch up to you're gonna lose and then

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.680 
catch up to you're gonna lose and then
same<00:06:59.960> thing<00:06:59.990> if<00:07:00.380> you<00:07:00.560> up<00:07:00.740> just<00:07:01.520> play<00:07:01.819> the

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
same thing if you up just play the

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.330 
same thing if you up just play the
objective<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:03.770> then<00:07:03.860> you'll<00:07:04.039> just<00:07:04.190> get

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
objective and then you'll just get

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.040 
objective and then you'll just get
killed<00:07:04.610> every<00:07:04.880> time<00:07:05.060> so<00:07:05.630> there<00:07:05.780> has<00:07:05.900> to<00:07:05.930> be

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
killed every time so there has to be

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.850 
killed every time so there has to be
like<00:07:06.229> a<00:07:06.289> little<00:07:06.409> bit<00:07:06.560> of<00:07:06.680> a<00:07:06.740> balance

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
like a little bit of a balance
