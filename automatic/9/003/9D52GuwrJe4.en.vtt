00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone today we are here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.259
 because the pack is already available 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.150
 new that they have taken out with the mascot of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.330
 deus and the tree 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.309
 the mating nest and well I'll 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.250
 explain how you get it because it 's 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.510
 quite complicated I did not expect 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 what was going to happen but good 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.650
 when entering the game you will surely leave 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.180
 this same thing came out of my main account 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.220
 here writing to myself because I am 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.500
 in another level 7 account 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.860
 when entering, this comes out even though it's level 50 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.100
 as I do not care and they find it 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 the deus mascot well this has 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 got ok 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.219
 this means that you can already get it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.940
 the mascot is here the offer 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.579
 we just have to give it 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.079
 and the start team 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.350
 this pack will cost 450 gems 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.909
 but now it will cost 50 this offer will be 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.879
 will be available until the 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.449
 level 10 or that the time is gone is 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.759
 say I explain it if you're level 50 like 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.590
 me or more than 10 this offer is not going to 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.399
 leaving this offer is only for those who 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.869
 they are level 10 down so I 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.390
 I put in an account that level 7 that I already 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.490
 I had a long time ago and I'm going to buy 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.380
 the pack that I do have a gem and they do 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.539
 50 as I 'm going to get it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.320
 easy I give to buy gems 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.320
 or get gems 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 I bought this that comes out here 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.390
 what I do not understand is because I did 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.420
 a second 20% less and they do not do it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.210
 he 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.960
 I suppose you can wait and it has already 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.300
 20 gone here all you pay are 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.920
 80 cents that does not matter 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.160
 so good now I'm going to buy the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.840
 gems and buy this in two ways if not 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.620
 the offer comes out I suppose the package 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.620
 he also has to leave 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.230
 it does not come out the anterio I think that if it left 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.000
 in package 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.960
 but it seems that this is not looking for 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 see if it comes out somewhere 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.360
 in theory only the right comes out but the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.290
 previous package that there was if it came out in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 in packages I think I'm not sure one hundred 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.730
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.070
 and then the east building is not 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.740
 here that is, at the moment you can not 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.030
 get loose so I'm going to have to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.480
 buy this so we can see what it is 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.480
 coming 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.829
 and well I have already bought them and have a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.730
 a little bit of trouble because I was missing 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:35.810
 4 cents to buy those of father 65 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.270
 I left there the receipt thing this weird 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 because after saying that I hacked them 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.260
 I know you have seen me 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.489
 bought had a problem and it's going to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.920
 buying this pack I was missing 4 cents 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.800
 so we bought twice this 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 and it came to me so that I get the likes 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.050
 I have 51 gems and we are going to finally see what 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.500
 is what brings this good pact we see it 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.750
 here but 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:08.650
 let's see it in physical 50 gems 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.870
 says congratulations has gone up two levels 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.830
 are in the perfect warehouse to go up two 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.020
 levels every two gems 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.280
 it's the same the video looks very slow 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.319
 because I'm recording it with firefox 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 and fatal firefox is a crap 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.599
 bájale the graficó 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.599
 that the fire was a total crap 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.430
 but in the google chrome I have my 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.270
 original facebook but here is the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.280
 dragon egg the slug 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.470
 for the nest tower this is full 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.090
 egg out I do not want it 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.510
 and this the same thing I'm going to have to do 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.510
 space 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 well we just use this time 58 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.260
 seconds so we can wait for you and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.250
 while we are going to go putting this 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.930
 good right here six giants 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.040
 here it fits 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.310
 here is I'm going to see why it works for 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.130
 pair and what is special 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.530
 this is where magic happens 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.790
 but this time in a nest with two 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.790
 dragons and I hope it comes out 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.169
 Well it seems to be an idol 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.919
 what is this building is what I 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.880
 he said in the vault that so much is put in 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.280
 the pages what I said together 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.100
 and here it's going to come out and this we're going to see 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.270
 the types the attacks and then see in 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.990
 fight because I do not have the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.990
 training 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.240
 and well I'm here I 'm going to close one 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.820
 partner or if something special comes out that comes out 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.720
 of this type plant 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.790
 earth and I'm going to kick this 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.940
 bender 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.910
 and placed on the deus mascots 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.449
 seen the levels 1 level we will go up the 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.529
 level 4 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.529
 and this one at level 4 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.580
 and level 7 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.470
 the debt of the animation I can 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.430
 upload a day and so I think we see more 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.280
 attacks 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.170
 it's okay the most crazy going up after 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.090
 we are going to come here to pair we are going with 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.230
 this 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.850
 with 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.850
 this time and it will be special 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.200
 it ends in a minute I do not know if it takes 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.390
 less special things come out the truth 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.520
 I have no idea why 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.650
 and I have it as soon as I see some 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.150
 news to see what it is for you 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.340
 I say but let's surely be like the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.180
 100 gems breeding tree about what 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.800
 this has cost you 50 pounds with it 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.360
 with the pet is included 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.720
 and to see what is going to come out in 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.720
 one minute 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.360
 and hey, this is ready, let's see 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.360
 what comes out 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:30.159
 it seems that dragon which 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.280
 I do not know if it will be weird, but I think it's 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.280
 the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.340
 the normal blizzard 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.360
 what I'm going to do is keep trying 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.520
 combinations of if something special comes out 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.110
 of course by putting this one is not going to 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.990
 leave nothing special because it's kind 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.000
 earth to fire what yes it may come out 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.990
 something special maybe if it sets fire 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.080
 earth something comes out something special 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.680
 but hey I'm going to wait and now I 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.020
 I teach 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.570
 Okay, this was already what it has 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.630
 out of the snowdrifts had said 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:08.570
 selling here has come of age so 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.479
 I think that what always has nothing comes out 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.100
 special is simply an extra nest 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.960
 to make more combinations at the same time 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.160
 You can put this with this one at a time and 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.440
 with him the tree can have 3 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.190
 3rd sarongs at a time but good that's 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.630
 all 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:30.110
 two extra levels in the mascot of 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.120
 gold nest and food I think 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.580
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.110
 the video any doubt to put it in the 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.360
 comments and attempts to answer 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.980
 subscribe to the channel to see when 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.710
 upload a new video but I always 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.600
 posted on facebook 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.600
 see you next video goodbye
