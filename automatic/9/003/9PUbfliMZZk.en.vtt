00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
two two so we've gone ahead and sped up

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.739 
two two so we've gone ahead and sped up
the<00:00:49.100> video<00:00:49.579> here<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:50.210> don't<00:00:50.300> have<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.539> wait

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
the video here so you don't have to wait

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.590 
the video here so you don't have to wait
for<00:00:51.550> several<00:00:52.550> minutes<00:00:52.789> for<00:00:53.089> all<00:00:53.179> the<00:00:53.239> download

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
for several minutes for all the download

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.840 
for several minutes for all the download
to<00:00:53.780> complete<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:55.280> still<00:00:55.489> takes<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.730> little

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
to complete it still takes a little

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.059 
to complete it still takes a little
while<00:00:56.030> though<00:00:58.839> okay<00:00:59.839> downloads<00:01:00.289> complete<00:01:00.679> I'm

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
while though okay downloads complete I'm

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.799 
while though okay downloads complete I'm
going<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.670> go<00:01:01.879> ahead<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.300> double<00:01:02.569> click<00:01:02.780> that

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
going to go ahead and double click that

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.700 
going to go ahead and double click that
to<00:01:03.109> open<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.440> up<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:05.080> we're<00:01:06.080> going<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.260> copy<00:01:06.470> it

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
to open it up and we're going to copy it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.210 
to open it up and we're going to copy it
into<00:01:06.830> c<00:01:07.759> /<00:01:08.000> Program<00:01:08.810> Files<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.770> go<00:01:09.950> ahead

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
into c / Program Files so to go ahead

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
into c / Program Files so to go ahead
and<00:01:10.369> just<00:01:10.520> drag<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.180> drop<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.689> there

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
and just drag it and drop it in there

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.319 
and just drag it and drop it in there
and<00:01:13.450> click<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.630> confirm<00:01:15.970> again<00:01:16.970> takes<00:01:17.270> a

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
and click on confirm again takes a

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.200 
and click on confirm again takes a
little<00:01:17.450> while<00:01:17.689> cause<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:18.079> a<00:01:18.140> big<00:01:18.320> file<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.700> we

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
little while cause it's a big file so we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.609 
little while cause it's a big file so we
just<00:01:20.390> go<00:01:20.479> ahead<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:20.810> wait<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.380> copy

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
just go ahead and wait for that to copy

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.820 
just go ahead and wait for that to copy
into<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:22.880> directory

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.270 

can<00:01:28.830> copies<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.580> finished<00:01:29.940> now<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
can copies just about finished now so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
can copies just about finished now so
let's<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.610> ahead<00:01:32.730> and<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.840> Program

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
let's go ahead and go into the Program

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
let's go ahead and go into the Program
Files<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.310> Arduino

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060

0:02<00:01:36.870> -<00:01:37.170> directory<00:01:37.830> because<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
0:02 - directory because the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
0:02 - directory because the
installation<00:01:39.770> doesn't<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.920> create<00:01:41.250> any

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
installation doesn't actually create any

installation doesn't actually create any
links<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.910> us<00:01:42.120> so<00:01:42.450> we'll<00:01:42.570> right-click<00:01:43.050> on<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
links for us so we'll right-click on the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.680 
links for us so we'll right-click on the
arduino<00:01:44.100> executable<00:01:44.790> i'm<00:01:44.940> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> create<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
arduino executable i'm going to create a

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.550 
arduino executable i'm going to create a
shortcut<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.410> place<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> desktop

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
what we want to do now is when i plug

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
what we want to do now is when i plug
our<00:01:59.399> board<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.850> basically<00:02:00.720> it's<00:02:00.930> closed<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
our board in basically it's closed on a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.310 
our board in basically it's closed on a
few<00:02:01.470> windows<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:05.430> our<00:02:05.550> board<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
few windows and get our board out and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.780 
few windows and get our board out and
we'll<00:02:07.320> plug<00:02:07.500> our<00:02:07.680> board<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> USB<00:02:08.580> port

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
we'll plug our board into the USB port

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.960 
we'll plug our board into the USB port
and<00:02:09.450> windows<00:02:10.380> seven<00:02:10.800> should<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.310> recognize

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and windows seven should then recognize

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.229 
and windows seven should then recognize
a<00:02:12.000> new<00:02:12.239> device<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:14.550> won't<00:02:14.820> be<00:02:14.910> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> read

a new device it won't be able to read

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.729 
a new device it won't be able to read
the<00:02:15.330> drivers<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.170> because<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> doesn't

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
the drivers for it because it doesn't

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.740 
the drivers for it because it doesn't

boards<00:04:48.860> for<00:04:49.039> Arduino<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:51.200> let's<00:04:51.410> go<00:04:51.560> ahead

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
boards for Arduino and let's go ahead

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.730 
boards for Arduino and let's go ahead
and<00:04:52.039> load<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.880> basic<00:04:53.330> blink<00:04:53.990> program<00:04:54.620> which

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and load the basic blink program which

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.790 
and load the basic blink program which
is<00:04:54.889> flushes<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.580> onboard<00:04:56.120> led<00:04:56.419> on<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.470> your

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
is flushes the onboard led on on your

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.640 
is flushes the onboard led on on your
Arduino<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.340> know<00:04:58.550> board<00:04:59.080> and<00:05:00.080> click<00:05:00.410> on<00:05:00.530> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
Arduino you know board and click on the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.000 
Arduino you know board and click on the
compile<00:05:01.010> button<00:05:01.280> there<00:05:01.910> will<00:05:02.860> compile<00:05:03.860> the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
compile button there will compile the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.909 
compile button there will compile the
sketch<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.840> upload<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:06.169> in<00:05:06.320> one<00:05:06.530> you

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
sketch and upload it all in one you

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.629 
sketch and upload it all in one you
should<00:05:07.130> see<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.669> has<00:05:08.150> been<00:05:08.330> successful

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
should see that has been successful

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.420 
should see that has been successful
okay<00:05:11.060> let's<00:05:11.479> see<00:05:11.749> if<00:05:11.810> that's<00:05:11.990> worked<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:13.219> we

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
okay let's see if that's worked and we

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.760 
okay let's see if that's worked and we
get<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:13.759> a<00:05:13.939> flashing<00:05:14.180> LED<00:05:14.659> that<00:05:15.439> proves<00:05:15.710> that

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
get this a flashing LED that proves that

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.830 
get this a flashing LED that proves that
the<00:05:15.889> program<00:05:16.520> was<00:05:16.699> uploaded<00:05:17.300> okay<00:05:17.569> and

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
the program was uploaded okay and

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.190 
the program was uploaded okay and
everything's<00:05:18.110> working

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.260
