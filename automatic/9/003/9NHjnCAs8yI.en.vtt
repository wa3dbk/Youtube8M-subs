hey guys a shaky hair right yeah you

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.019 
hey guys a shaky hair right yeah you
know<00:00:15.500> welcome<00:00:15.799> to<00:00:16.010> how<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.160> spawn<00:00:16.580> trap<00:00:16.850> on

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
know welcome to how to spawn trap on

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.640 
know welcome to how to spawn trap on
right<00:00:17.300> and<00:00:17.600> this<00:00:17.689> this<00:00:17.990> map<00:00:18.140> in<00:00:18.260> particular

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
right and this this map in particular

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.500 
right and this this map in particular
it's<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.070> really<00:00:19.340> weird<00:00:19.730> because<00:00:19.880> it's<00:00:20.270> not

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's it's really weird because it's not

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.810 
it's it's really weird because it's not
that<00:00:20.840> affecting<00:00:21.500> spawn<00:00:21.800> trapping<00:00:22.070> because<00:00:22.490> of

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
that affecting spawn trapping because of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.760 
that affecting spawn trapping because of
how<00:00:23.030> small<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:23.600> is<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:23.990> how<00:00:24.050> close<00:00:24.320> squared<00:00:24.680> it

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
how small it is and how close squared it

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.500 
how small it is and how close squared it
is<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.580> really<00:00:25.910> there<00:00:26.060> will<00:00:26.150> be<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.240> lot<00:00:26.420> of

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
is so really there will be a lot of

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.660 
is so really there will be a lot of
small<00:00:26.960> flipping<00:00:27.410> every<00:00:27.619> now<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:27.920> then<00:00:28.039> from<00:00:28.460> C

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
small flipping every now and then from C

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.029 
small flipping every now and then from C
to<00:00:28.699> a<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:29.720> yeah<00:00:29.930> there's<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.410> certain<00:00:30.619> degree

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
to a but yeah there's a certain degree

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.889 
to a but yeah there's a certain degree
of<00:00:31.070> knowing<00:00:31.670> exactly<00:00:31.850> where<00:00:32.419> people<00:00:32.780> will

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
of knowing exactly where people will

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.360 
of knowing exactly where people will
spawn<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.649> knowledge<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.160> really

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
spawn and that knowledge is really

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.130 
spawn and that knowledge is really
important<00:00:34.699> in<00:00:34.760> order<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.940> successfully<00:00:35.359> play

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
important in order to successfully play

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.139 
important in order to successfully play
on<00:00:36.319> this<00:00:36.469> map<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:36.769> as<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.249> can<00:00:37.370> see<00:00:37.429> the

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
on this map so as you can see the

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.450 
on this map so as you can see the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
labeled map as you can see on the screen

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.869 
labeled map as you can see on the screen
right<00:00:42.199> now<00:00:42.379> is<00:00:42.679> the<00:00:42.710> enlarged<00:00:43.159> version<00:00:43.339> of<00:00:43.670> the

right now is the enlarged version of the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.389 
right now is the enlarged version of the
map<00:00:44.089> itself<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.780> rate<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.949> circles<00:00:46.339> that

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
map itself and rate and the circles that

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.669 
map itself and rate and the circles that
I<00:00:46.519> played<00:00:46.789> with<00:00:46.909> myself<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.659> the<00:00:47.870> Zack<00:00:48.139> points

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
I played with myself is the Zack points

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.459 
I played with myself is the Zack points
where<00:00:49.100> people<00:00:49.519> would<00:00:49.639> spawn<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.269> certain<00:00:51.199> time

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
where people would spawn a certain time

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.139 
where people would spawn a certain time
of<00:00:51.499> the<00:00:51.710> certain<00:00:52.100> situation<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.760> game<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
of the certain situation of the game so

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.279 
of the certain situation of the game so
as<00:00:53.239> I've<00:00:53.359> said<00:00:53.389> already<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.839> way<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.019> spawn

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
as I've said already the way to spawn

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.079 
as I've said already the way to spawn
system<00:00:54.710> works<00:00:54.949> is<00:00:55.190> there<00:00:55.699> was<00:00:55.789> spawned

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
system works is there was spawned

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.360 
system works is there was spawned
opponents<00:00:56.870> at<00:00:57.049> empty<00:00:57.709> area<00:00:58.100> where<00:00:58.249> your

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
opponents at empty area where your

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.189 
opponents at empty area where your
teammates<00:00:58.729> are<00:00:58.969> not<00:00:59.089> there<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.569> if<00:00:59.929> you're<00:01:00.049> by

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
teammates are not there and if you're by

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.289 
teammates are not there and if you're by
yourself<00:01:00.229> you're<00:01:00.920> most<00:01:01.399> likely<00:01:01.670> will<00:01:02.149> be

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
yourself you're most likely will be

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.030 
yourself you're most likely will be
surrounded<00:01:02.780> by<00:01:02.809> players<00:01:03.229> around<00:01:03.530> these<00:01:03.799> spawn

surrounded by players around these spawn

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.370 
surrounded by players around these spawn
points<00:01:04.400> that<00:01:04.519> I've<00:01:04.610> labeled<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.170> from

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
points that I've labeled so this is from

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.080 
points that I've labeled so this is from
my<00:01:06.590> knowledge<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.010> experience<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:07.880> know

my knowledge and experience that I know

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.540 
my knowledge and experience that I know
that<00:01:08.540> each<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.050> every<00:01:09.230> spawn<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.800> this<00:01:10.370> map

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
that each and every spawn on this map

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.900 
that each and every spawn on this map
that<00:01:10.580> are<00:01:10.790> labeled<00:01:11.080> from<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.910> experience

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
that are labeled from the experience

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.370 
that are labeled from the experience
that<00:01:14.060> I've<00:01:14.180> gone<00:01:14.330> against<00:01:14.690> players<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.260> in

that I've gone against players and in
radan<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.860> can<00:01:16.100> see<00:01:16.280> them<00:01:16.490> spawning<00:01:16.880> there

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
radan I can see them spawning there

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.150 
radan I can see them spawning there
because<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.260> way<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.410> play<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.010> way<00:01:19.130> I

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
because of the way I play in the way I

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.550 
because of the way I play in the way I
rush<00:01:19.460> now<00:01:20.150> if<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:20.720> play<00:01:20.900> style<00:01:21.170> sort

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
rush now if you of your play style sort

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.860 
rush now if you of your play style sort
of<00:01:21.650> campy<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:22.790> defensive<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.510> don't<00:01:23.690> you

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
of campy or defensive you don't you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.150 
of campy or defensive you don't you
wouldn't<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.200> can't<00:01:24.470> really<00:01:24.620> figure<00:01:24.830> out<00:01:24.980> the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
wouldn't you can't really figure out the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.480 
wouldn't you can't really figure out the
spawns<00:01:25.400> by<00:01:25.820> doing<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.220> hopefully<00:01:28.220> these

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
spawns by doing that so hopefully these

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.760 
spawns by doing that so hopefully these
spawn<00:01:29.150> points<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:29.720> help<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.020> guys<00:01:30.200> become

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
spawn points can help you guys become

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.710 
spawn points can help you guys become
more<00:01:31.010> successful<00:01:31.190> by<00:01:31.850> playing<00:01:32.120> this<00:01:32.300> map<00:01:32.510> I'll

just to see how I do with it and see how

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.389 
just to see how I do with it and see how
I<00:02:08.989> can<00:02:09.110> adapt<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:09.409> it<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.190> yeah<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.340> definitely

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
I can adapt to it so yeah I definitely

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.979 
I can adapt to it so yeah I definitely
tried<00:02:10.759> out<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.180> really<00:02:11.330> went<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.870> me

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
tried out and it really went well for me

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.330 
tried out and it really went well for me
but<00:02:12.109> some<00:02:12.379> reason<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.739> was<00:02:13.010> running<00:02:13.219> out

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
but some reason I was running out

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.750 
but some reason I was running out
amination

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
amination

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.849 
amination
way<00:02:13.969> too<00:02:14.030> fast<00:02:14.389> and<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:15.109> will<00:02:15.230> notice<00:02:15.469> as<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
way too fast and you will notice as I

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.050 
way too fast and you will notice as I
lose<00:02:16.219> a<00:02:16.249> lot<00:02:16.639> of<00:02:16.730> blood

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
lose a lot of blood

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.610 
lose a lot of blood
it's<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:17.780> after<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> as<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.500> see

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it's just after this and as you can see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.949 
it's just after this and as you can see
the<00:02:19.190> label<00:02:19.489> diver<00:02:19.730> under<00:02:20.060> labeled<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.630> label

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
the label diver under labeled in a label

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.720 
the label diver under labeled in a label
map<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.800> top<00:02:21.980> right<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.489> screen<00:02:22.520> right

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
map on the top right of the screen right

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.400 
map on the top right of the screen right
now<00:02:22.910> it's<00:02:23.540> basically<00:02:23.900> where<00:02:24.230> they're

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
now it's basically where they're

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.620 
now it's basically where they're
spawning<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.580> pretty<00:02:25.790> efficient<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
spawning so it is pretty efficient in a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.170 
spawning so it is pretty efficient in a
sense<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.530> by<00:02:27.830> by<00:02:28.819> playing<00:02:29.060> this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
sense that you know by by playing this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.550 
sense that you know by by playing this
game<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:29.420> quite<00:02:29.660> some<00:02:29.959> time<00:02:29.989> not<00:02:30.440> know

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
game for quite some time not know

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.380 
game for quite some time not know
exactly<00:02:30.980> where<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.220> spawn<00:02:31.430> hopefully<00:02:32.239> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
exactly where they spawn hopefully can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
exactly where they spawn hopefully can
help<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.690> guys<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.260> know<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:34.099> these<00:02:34.400> guys

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
help you guys to know where these guys

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.710 
help you guys to know where these guys
were<00:02:34.640> spooling<00:02:35.000> once<00:02:35.209> you're<00:02:35.360> playing<00:02:35.599> on

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
were spooling once you're playing on

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.910 
were spooling once you're playing on
this<00:02:35.840> map<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.200> I'll<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.349> doing<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.709> future

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
this map and I'll be doing it for future

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.759 
this map and I'll be doing it for future
Maps<00:02:37.160> obviously<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.110> downside<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.680> this

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
Maps obviously so the downside to this

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.960 
Maps obviously so the downside to this
map<00:02:39.920> obviously<00:02:40.250> as<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.370> can<00:02:40.430> see<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.819> really

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
map obviously as you can see it's really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.339 
map obviously as you can see it's really
really<00:02:41.060> hard<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.540> spawn<00:02:41.720> trap<00:02:41.930> when<00:02:42.050> all<00:02:42.200> of

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
really hard to spawn trap when all of

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.020 
really hard to spawn trap when all of
the<00:02:42.410> teammates<00:02:42.800> are<00:02:43.069> at<00:02:43.280> their<00:02:43.489> spawn<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the teammates are at their spawn and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.180 
the teammates are at their spawn and
automatically<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.530> spawns<00:02:45.769> will<00:02:45.980> flip

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
automatically the the spawns will flip

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.890 
automatically the the spawns will flip
and<00:02:46.370> that's<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> way<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.090> works<00:02:47.330> because

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
and that's just the way it works because

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.380 
and that's just the way it works because
you<00:02:48.140> know<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.950> can't<00:02:49.250> just<00:02:49.549> constantly<00:02:50.120> spawn

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
you know you can't just constantly spawn

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
you know you can't just constantly spawn
and<00:02:50.510> trap<00:02:50.660> them<00:02:50.810> that's<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.290> not

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and trap them that's this is not

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.520 
and trap them that's this is not
demolition<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:53.299> know<00:02:53.420> speaking<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.470> that

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
demolition so you know speaking of that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.430 
demolition so you know speaking of that
when<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.910> post<00:02:56.150> bigger<00:02:56.390> Maps<00:02:56.690> it's<00:02:57.049> more<00:02:57.260> easy

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
when I post bigger Maps it's more easy

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.809 
when I post bigger Maps it's more easy
to<00:02:57.620> spawn<00:02:57.830> trap<00:02:58.040> because<00:02:58.160> you'd<00:02:58.400> probably<00:02:58.610> be

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
to spawn trap because you'd probably be

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.430 
to spawn trap because you'd probably be
the<00:02:58.910> only<00:02:59.180> dude<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.720> other<00:02:59.870> side<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
the only dude and the other side of the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.900 
the only dude and the other side of the
team<00:03:00.650> where<00:03:00.860> your<00:03:00.950> teammates<00:03:01.250> probably<00:03:01.670> sit

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
team where your teammates probably sit

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.160 
team where your teammates probably sit
back<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.330> that's<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.720> way<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.989> works

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
back and that's just the way it works

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.020 
back and that's just the way it works
for<00:03:03.380> bigger<00:03:03.530> Maps<00:03:03.769> some<00:03:04.069> reason<00:03:04.370> people<00:03:04.880> are

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
for bigger Maps some reason people are

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.550 
for bigger Maps some reason people are
more<00:03:05.209> cautious<00:03:05.420> about<00:03:05.660> things<00:03:05.989> but<00:03:06.110> raid<00:03:06.319> is

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
more cautious about things but raid is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470 
more cautious about things but raid is
special<00:03:07.130> in<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> sense<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:08.299> such<00:03:08.450> a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
special in the sense that it's such a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.229 
special in the sense that it's such a
small<00:03:08.780> map<00:03:09.049> as<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.560> can<00:03:09.709> see<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.190> go<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.819> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
small map as you can see I go to a and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.630 
small map as you can see I go to a and
then<00:03:11.390> spawn<00:03:11.660> flips<00:03:12.190> immediately<00:03:13.190> as<00:03:13.280> soon<00:03:13.489> as

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
then spawn flips immediately as soon as

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.870 
then spawn flips immediately as soon as
we<00:03:13.760> take<00:03:14.150> our<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.780> we<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:15.799> back<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.430> C<00:03:16.760> again

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
we take our a and we go back to C again

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.210 
we take our a and we go back to C again
so<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:17.900> are<00:03:18.019> really<00:03:18.260> dominating<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:18.950> let's<00:03:19.099> can

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
so we are really dominating it let's can

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.069 
so we are really dominating it let's can
see<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.340> kind<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.670> :<00:03:20.000> my<00:03:20.090> dogs<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:20.780> swarm

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
see I kind of a : my dogs and my swarm

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.259 
see I kind of a : my dogs and my swarm
because<00:03:21.440> there<00:03:22.070> it's<00:03:22.310> already<00:03:22.549> inbound<00:03:22.970> and

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
because there it's already inbound and

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.690 
because there it's already inbound and
some<00:03:24.140> other<00:03:24.290> dudes<00:03:24.530> used<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> game<00:03:25.280> it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
some other dudes used in the game it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.400 
some other dudes used in the game it's

so it was kind of annoying and yet again
the<00:03:30.170> spawn<00:03:30.440> flips<00:03:30.799> one<00:03:31.459> more<00:03:31.670> time<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.420> as<00:03:32.840> we

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
the next clip here as you can see we

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.539 
the next clip here as you can see we
MSMC<00:03:56.720> my<00:03:57.019> class<00:03:57.350> here<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.859> we're<00:03:58.340> playing

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
MSMC my class here and we're playing

MSMC my class here and we're playing
Kill<00:03:58.730> Confirmed<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.299> it's<00:03:59.450> not<00:03:59.540> domination

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
Kill Confirmed so it's not domination

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.050 
Kill Confirmed so it's not domination
and<00:04:00.230> obviously<00:04:00.950> these<00:04:01.130> spawn<00:04:01.370> points<00:04:01.700> labeled

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
and obviously these spawn points labeled

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.270 
and obviously these spawn points labeled
on<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.239> top<00:04:02.389> right<00:04:02.660> are<00:04:02.900> basically<00:04:03.380> they<00:04:04.069> come

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
on the top right are basically they come

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.620 
on the top right are basically they come
towards<00:04:04.730> team<00:04:04.940> deathmatch<00:04:05.150> Kill<00:04:05.600> Confirmed

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630

towards team deathmatch Kill Confirmed
as<00:04:06.200> well<00:04:06.530> as<00:04:06.650> domination<00:04:07.190> art<00:04:07.370> because<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
as well as domination art because you

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.150 
as well as domination art because you
know<00:04:07.940> they<00:04:08.569> all<00:04:08.750> got<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.079> same<00:04:09.319> spawn<00:04:09.739> points

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
know they all got the same spawn points

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.250 
know they all got the same spawn points
when<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.549> play<00:04:10.700> ground<00:04:11.000> war<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.540> knowing<00:04:12.079> this

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
when you play ground war so knowing this

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.640 
when you play ground war so knowing this
as<00:04:13.069> you<00:04:13.190> can<00:04:13.340> see<00:04:13.489> in<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.609> top<00:04:13.790> right<00:04:14.380> it<00:04:15.380> can

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
as you can see in the top right it can

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740 
as you can see in the top right it can
work<00:04:15.859> for<00:04:16.190> all<00:04:16.400> these<00:04:16.760> game<00:04:17.030> modes<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.479> it

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
work for all these game modes and it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.659 
work for all these game modes and it
really<00:04:17.989> does<00:04:18.260> help<00:04:18.470> having<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.459> knowledge

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
really does help having that knowledge

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.520 
really does help having that knowledge
it's<00:04:20.060> an<00:04:20.180> extra<00:04:20.539> advantage<00:04:20.989> over<00:04:21.169> people<00:04:21.500> that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
it's an extra advantage over people that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.200 
it's an extra advantage over people that
don't<00:04:21.889> even<00:04:22.100> know<00:04:22.220> where<00:04:22.789> people<00:04:22.970> are<00:04:23.060> gonna

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
don't even know where people are gonna

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.520 
don't even know where people are gonna
be<00:04:23.360> spawning<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.810> may<00:04:23.900> think<00:04:24.020> about<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.380> like<00:04:24.500> a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
be spawning I may think about it like a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.890 
be spawning I may think about it like a
lot<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> players<00:04:25.070> are<00:04:25.700> starting<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.240> biology

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
in-and-out technique which I tend to do

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.220 
in-and-out technique which I tend to do
nowadays<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.820> see<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:38.210> go<00:05:38.330> in<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.930> then<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.080> go

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
nowadays I see to go in and then you go

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.600 
nowadays I see to go in and then you go
out<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.890> can<00:05:40.070> take<00:05:40.250> them<00:05:40.370> out<00:05:40.460> of<00:05:40.520> a

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
out so you can take them out of a

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.190 
out so you can take them out of a
surprise<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.630> reason<00:05:41.870> why<00:05:41.960> this<00:05:42.020> works

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
surprise and the reason why this works

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.810 
surprise and the reason why this works
so<00:05:42.320> well<00:05:42.440> obviously<00:05:42.740> as<00:05:43.010> I<00:05:43.070> said<00:05:43.280> because<00:05:43.640> they

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
so well obviously as I said because they

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.310 
so well obviously as I said because they
can't<00:05:44.060> see<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.720> thing<00:05:44.870> about<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.260> is

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
can't see you the thing about this is

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.840 
can't see you the thing about this is
that<00:05:45.530> when<00:05:45.860> you<00:05:45.919> go<00:05:46.040> from<00:05:46.130> outer<00:05:46.340> skirts<00:05:46.610> they

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
that when you go from outer skirts they

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.650 
that when you go from outer skirts they
can<00:05:47.000> see<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.210> first

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
can see you first

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.330 
can see you first
which<00:05:48.050> is<00:05:48.200> quite<00:05:48.380> kind<00:05:48.800> of<00:05:48.890> bad<00:05:49.040> so<00:05:49.220> it's

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
which is quite kind of bad so it's

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.159 
which is quite kind of bad so it's
really<00:05:49.460> up<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.730> you<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.300> sort<00:05:50.480> of<00:05:50.570> player<00:05:51.140> you
