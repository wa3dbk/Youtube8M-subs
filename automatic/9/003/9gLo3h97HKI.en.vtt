00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you at all times is is a tire repair kit

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.340 
you at all times is is a tire repair kit
so<00:00:39.129> here<00:00:39.280> we've<00:00:39.429> kind<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.449> know<00:00:40.539> jammed<00:00:40.989> a

so here we've kind of you know jammed a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.500 
so here we've kind of you know jammed a
big<00:00:41.649> construction<00:00:42.370> nail<00:00:42.699> into<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.000> tire<00:00:43.300> and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
big construction nail into the tire and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.119 
big construction nail into the tire and
we're<00:00:44.019> just<00:00:44.140> gonna<00:00:44.230> get<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.590> pulled<00:00:44.859> out<00:00:45.010> of

there nope then you would take your
reaming<00:00:50.589> tool<00:00:50.800> here<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.280> know<00:00:51.730> on<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.999> trail

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
reaming tool here you know on the trail

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.700 
reaming tool here you know on the trail
you'll<00:00:52.390> have<00:00:52.539> a<00:00:52.570> lot<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.870> mud<00:00:53.109> and<00:00:53.260> debris<00:00:53.379> in

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
you'll have a lot of mud and debris in

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.329 
you'll have a lot of mud and debris in
that<00:00:53.859> sort<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.100> thing

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
that sort of thing

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.130 
that sort of thing
when<00:00:55.149> you're<00:00:55.269> actually<00:00:55.420> cleaning<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.960> hole

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
when you're actually cleaning the hole

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.660 
when you're actually cleaning the hole
out<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.499> actually<00:00:56.859> important<00:00:57.249> to<00:00:57.339> make<00:00:57.489> sure

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
out it's actually important to make sure

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.700 
out it's actually important to make sure
that<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:58.390> actually<00:00:58.539> get<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:59.019> puncture<00:00:59.499> hold

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
that you actually get that puncture hold

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.349 
that you actually get that puncture hold
big<00:00:59.949> enough<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.399> it'll<00:01:00.609> actually<00:01:00.699> accept

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
big enough so that it'll actually accept

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.049 
big enough so that it'll actually accept
a<00:01:01.449> rubber<00:01:01.809> plug<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:03.489> able<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.699> push<00:01:03.909> that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
a rubber plug and be able to push that

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.400 
a rubber plug and be able to push that
rubber<00:01:04.300> plug<00:01:04.540> right<00:01:04.720> through<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:05.170> it's<00:01:05.290> going

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
rubber plug right through so it's going

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.970 
rubber plug right through so it's going
to<00:01:05.470> get<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.620> nice<00:01:05.800> good<00:01:05.980> seal<00:01:06.340> on<00:01:06.730> your<00:01:06.790> puncture

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
to get a nice good seal on your puncture

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.530 
to get a nice good seal on your puncture
you<00:01:08.980> have<00:01:09.130> your<00:01:09.280> insertion<00:01:09.760> tool<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:13.300> lost

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
you have your insertion tool you lost

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.730 
you have your insertion tool you lost
your<00:01:13.720> rubber

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.840 

once<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.860> have<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.100> hooked<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.460> there<00:01:18.670> then

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
once you have that hooked in there then

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.620 
once you have that hooked in there then
you<00:01:18.880> go<00:01:19.030> ahead<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.950> push

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.740 

there<00:01:27.229> we<00:01:27.500> go<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.610> we<00:01:28.729> recommend<00:01:29.000> once<00:01:29.659> you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
there we go and we recommend once you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.780 
there we go and we recommend once you
get<00:01:29.869> your<00:01:29.990> tire<00:01:30.170> plug<00:01:30.409> put<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:31.100> actually

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
get your tire plug put in to actually

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.910 
get your tire plug put in to actually
cut<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.060> excess<00:01:32.420> of<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.750> plug<00:01:33.020> off<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.830> know

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
cut the excess of the plug off you know

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.210 
cut the excess of the plug off you know
maybe<00:01:34.100> not<00:01:34.340> 100%<00:01:34.610> flush<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.770> enough<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.130> you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
maybe not 100% flush but enough so you

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.219 
maybe not 100% flush but enough so you
got<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.400> little<00:01:37.729> bit<00:01:37.850> left<00:01:38.000> over<00:01:38.330> there<00:01:38.479> just<00:01:39.140> so

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
got a little bit left over there just so

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.450 
got a little bit left over there just so
it's<00:01:39.380> sticking<00:01:39.619> out<00:01:39.770> there<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.100> actually

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's sticking out there and actually

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.520 
it's sticking out there and actually
packing<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.390> fill<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:41.960> hole<00:01:42.259> rate<00:01:42.439> up<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
packing and fill that hole rate up so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.350 
packing and fill that hole rate up so
when<00:01:45.619> you're<00:01:45.799> have<00:01:46.460> your<00:01:46.580> co2<00:01:46.820> cartridge

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
when you're have your co2 cartridge

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.850 
when you're have your co2 cartridge
you're<00:01:47.509> ready<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.869> put<00:01:48.289> at<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.409> end<00:01:48.470> it's<00:01:48.680> nice

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
you're ready to put at the end it's nice

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.170 
you're ready to put at the end it's nice
to<00:01:49.039> make<00:01:49.190> sure<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.820> actual

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
to make sure you have the actual

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.719 
to make sure you have the actual
insulator<00:01:50.960> cover<00:01:51.259> on<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.100> co2<00:01:52.340> cartridge

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
insulator cover on the co2 cartridge

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.840 
insulator cover on the co2 cartridge
it's<00:01:53.690> it's<00:01:53.990> extremely<00:01:54.710> cold<00:01:54.920> when<00:01:55.759> you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's it's extremely cold when you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.370 
it's it's extremely cold when you
actually<00:01:56.000> release<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.570> gases<00:01:56.960> out<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.229> there

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
