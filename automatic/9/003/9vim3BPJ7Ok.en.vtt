extremely good because of the cars great
balance<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.700> lightweight<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.020> car

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
balance and it's lightweight so the car

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.199 
balance and it's lightweight so the car
is<00:02:21.440> now<00:02:21.680> cosmetically<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.760> was<00:02:22.910> when<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> got

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
is now cosmetically as it was when I got

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.050 
is now cosmetically as it was when I got
it<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.610> little<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
it I would like to do the little bit of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.449 
it I would like to do the little bit of
bodywork<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.629> it<00:02:26.720> does<00:02:26.930> need<00:02:27.459> mechanically

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
bodywork that it does need mechanically

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.949 
bodywork that it does need mechanically
there's<00:02:28.670> really<00:02:28.849> not<00:02:29.180> anything<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.840> it

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
there's really not anything that it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.140 
there's really not anything that it
needs<00:02:30.200> right<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:30.500> aside<00:02:31.489> from<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> new<00:02:31.940> set<00:02:32.120> of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
needs right now aside from a new set of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.570 
needs right now aside from a new set of
shock<00:02:32.360> absorbers<00:02:33.099> one<00:02:34.099> other<00:02:34.220> thing<00:02:34.400> I'd<00:02:34.489> like

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
shock absorbers one other thing I'd like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.339 
shock absorbers one other thing I'd like
to<00:02:34.670> say<00:02:34.849> about<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.180> cars<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.660> really<00:02:35.989> love<00:02:36.170> its

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
to say about the cars I really love its

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.500 
to say about the cars I really love its
looks<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.790> people<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.209> really

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
looks I know you know people get really

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.210 
looks I know you know people get really
excited<00:02:38.900> about<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.530> coupes<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
excited about the the coupes and the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.770 
excited about the the coupes and the
convertibles<00:02:40.760> they're<00:02:41.000> pretty<00:02:41.180> sexy<00:02:41.629> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
convertibles they're pretty sexy and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.509 
convertibles they're pretty sexy and
racy<00:02:41.959> looking<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.620> agree<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> think<00:02:43.220> they're

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
racy looking and I agree I think they're

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.430 
racy looking and I agree I think they're
fantastic<00:02:44.150> looking<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:44.989> think<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:45.410> a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
fantastic looking but I think for a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.770 
fantastic looking but I think for a
little<00:02:45.680> sedan<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.310> car<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:46.849> really<00:02:47.420> really

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
little sedan this car is a really really

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.520 
little sedan this car is a really really
handsome

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
handsome

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.800 
handsome
it's<00:02:49.370> very<00:02:49.640> efficient<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.300> wouldn't<00:02:50.570> know<00:02:50.660> it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
it's very efficient you wouldn't know it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's very efficient you wouldn't know it
to<00:02:50.930> look<00:02:50.960> at<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:51.860> very<00:02:51.920> aerodynamic

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
to look at it but it's very aerodynamic

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.820 
to look at it but it's very aerodynamic
it's<00:02:53.480> got<00:02:53.660> lots<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:54.020> little<00:02:54.200> tricks<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.710> they

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's got lots of little tricks that they

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.950 
it's got lots of little tricks that they
did<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.160> design<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.640> body<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.810> make

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
did in the design of the body that make

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.480 
did in the design of the body that make
it<00:02:57.110> just<00:02:57.350> as<00:02:57.470> aerodynamic<00:02:57.710> as<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> other

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
it just as aerodynamic as the other

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.920 
it just as aerodynamic as the other
alphas<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:58.910> was<00:02:59.180> important<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> them

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
alphas that was important to them

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.510 
alphas that was important to them
there's<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.710> car<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.100> could<00:03:01.190> drive<00:03:01.370> at

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
there's a car that you could drive at

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.780 
there's a car that you could drive at
high<00:03:01.670> speeds<00:03:02.060> long<00:03:02.570> distances<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:03.380> day<00:03:03.530> long

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
high speeds long distances all day long

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.820 
high speeds long distances all day long
and<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> was<00:03:05.030> capable<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.600> doing<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.320> so

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
and it was capable of doing that and so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.310 
and it was capable of doing that and so
I<00:03:07.070> appreciate<00:03:07.400> all<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.120> about<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.050> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
I appreciate all of that about the the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.870 
I appreciate all of that about the the
careful<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:09.800> intelligent<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.760> thoughtful

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
careful and intelligent and thoughtful

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:29.680 
careful and intelligent and thoughtful
design

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.750
