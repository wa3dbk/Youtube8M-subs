00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.359
 everyone i hope you go 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.940
 well then today we have 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 made of paper as bulwarks which 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 is on my bracelet 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.360
 I hope you see it on your turn 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.850
 this is simple you ask papers 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.869
 gifts gifts 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.090
 we will need a classic golf stick 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 makers and a little body in for in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 steal your paper so that's your 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.869
 Here we are again for the rest 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 the first step in celebration is to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.250
 cut out gift wrap 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.129
 so according to length and width 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.750
 that you want more the part will be 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.039
 long longer will make you big 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.579
 plus the width will be long over your 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 father who will be long too also 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 so that's so if you make a band 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.579
 pretty much right it will make you a table 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.080
 cylindrical and after if you want some 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.040
 different forms so in fact it takes 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.040
 leave there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.670
 it's finished the next press how 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.840
 you roll your task on the toothpick 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.470
 that it can make you shapes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 different 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.990
 so we'll do two so after 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.040
 it's very simple you return your 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.230
 paper unprinted side you take the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.170
 sticks so you do not put all 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.750
 at the beginning it's about the space 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.000
 punk job leaves you pretty much 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.610
 the space of a homework and after you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.610
 put some glue all along 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 Of the band 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.880
 once you have put your glue 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 he only had to roll your paper 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.920
 around the water, starting with 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.900
 done by the area 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.810
 where you did not put glue for not 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.790
 obviously that the paper stuck to the body 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.920
 once we did that 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.920
 here you roll the paper like this 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.200
 you have to have the collar and if you see 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.260
 that there are places where there is no 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.260
 enough glue you can add 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.170
 so try to put it right 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.040
 safra really a pretty pearl 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.720
 cylindrical 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.730
 what I like is to do 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.460
 really full of different forms 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 and then like on my early bracelet 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.170
 that you actually associate it with 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.900
 rock charms and that can it 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 can make something nice enough 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 So here is once it was funny 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.450
 it's really quite simple so we roll 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 we can even do it with children 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.000
 here is 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.610
 at worst you make them the beginning if 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.230
 it's a bit complicated and girls there I 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.730
 will add a little glue this is what 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.730
 it's a little dried 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.030
 and that's it 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.890
 this is my first talk I just have to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.750
 exit I have a barley hole not if you 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.330
 get to see they find for 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.800
 to be able to pass the wire so to do 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.080
 a different form like I you 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.410
 said so we cut a paper that is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.630
 linen at the beginning and finer at the end we 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.190
 start with the broad side 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.770
 and always the same we are not glue 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:56.580
 at first we put on the rest of the 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:02.870
 band tac up 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.870
 once we put the glue we roll 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.439
 if we hold 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.040
 the beginning is always delicate 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.550
 well if so here 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.360
 and 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.430
 and then we 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.689
 measure as you roll like paper 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.689
 a factor is more and more hungry fear 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.689
 as well 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.539
 but 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.129
 Oh 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:53.059
 so that's it if you actually make your 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.059
 thinner in the middle 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.289
 and 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.240
 we will do higher val 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.770
 after your novel your fine rain band 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.699
 you can do it in glass or water 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.699
 which will make a term a little more 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.699
 triangular 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.450
 but 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.449
 you because we see well in the can is 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.979
 domestic 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.900
 in fact it's not the same shape as 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.900
 just now its wide share 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.710
 goal and then 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.979
 it comes back much stronger So here 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.979
 the 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.050
 it gives 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.540
 now we want thanks to the pearls a 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.700
 paper how to recycle succeeds two 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.830
 gift packages 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.320
 two pretty brassier I hope this 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.620
