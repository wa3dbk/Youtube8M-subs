00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.469
 hello friends ask a question 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 very common as Americans celebrate 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.360
 marriages 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.060
 I think that 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.700
 the variety is incredible of it all 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.890
 You can shortly here as they want and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.620
 celebrate but i think so will 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.090
 not enough detail I think that in 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.530
 first we need about budget 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.559
 talk because everyone 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.670
 marriage there is some kind of budget 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.530
 I once witnessed to squeeze him 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.900
 weddings in my opinion there you vegas 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.750
 was in some inexpensive buffet there 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.410
 cockpit paragraph 15 dollars for the entrance here and 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.050
 there means guests there is a check 30 means 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.680
 channel and here they are in this bouquet 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.120
 very budgetary here though they were clearly 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 in something so dressed rented 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.020
 there people see for one day there they take on 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.470
 two days and filmed and their 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.619
 bedroom all that budget 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.550
 taken here is where we live here a lot 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.240
 wine delhi and wineries 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.630
 respectively 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.950
 force your services like that and you 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.200
 you come that 0 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.469
 separate there is incredibly beautiful 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 entourage wine you drink there as you want and 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.920
 and accordingly there 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.920
 to a friend is beautiful and there is a place 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.130
 Where is the music to call earnings 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.439
 weddings that provide hotels 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.479
 the hotel, unlike the winery, has 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.189
 one advantage you can live right there 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.060
 Ie if guests and this often happens 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.340
 come from different places then arises 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.840
 question to where they all live with it and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.649
 you want them to collect the denominator of the world 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 immediately follows the question where to live this way in 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.750
 hotels also have such places specifically 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.650
 allotted where people walk 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.760
 there is a so -called blender and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.400
 boot blender and people who plan 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.930

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.560
 strange abstract construction in the form of

 Greek bottles and there are people under it 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.129

 there is such 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.810
 Vasya 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.670
 when we have something like 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.520

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.030

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.139
 variety I don't know what exactly 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.330
 he wanted to ask what to ask 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.620
 the question is probably he was not so 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.240
 general consciousness 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.520
 but simply he will formulate himself the meaning 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.390
 so it can be so common as candy 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.340

 a restaurant or something there or a hotel and 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.030

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.430
 they are not from all over the country and just local 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.080

 all travel are settled in this hotel 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.030
 who could later drink a little longer 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.590
 sit there and take a walk 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.600

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.160
