00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:04.661
 Eternity can be a curse. 

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.055
 The losses he had to suffer. 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:13.996
 A man may have no reason to live. 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.100
 Losing your purpose. 

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:29.774
 That hurt ! 

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.285
 Do not waste your time with them. 

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:37.955
 I've been looking for you for over a year. 

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:40.812
 My boss is dying. 

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:43.522
 He wants to thank you for saving his life. 

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:50.172
 It's an honor to meet you Wolverine. 

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:52.704
 It's not who I am anymore! 

00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:57.031
 I did not have to meet you just to thank you, Logan. 

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.419
 I want to pay you. 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.671
 A gift equivalent to the life you gave me. 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.344
 You've suffered enough. 

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.602
 Our company can do anything. 

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.094
 I can make you mortal! 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:28.377
 It is not healing as before. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.513
 What is going on? 

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:35.605
 THIS YEAR 

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.017
 HOW MUCH VULNERABLE IS HE 

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:53.524
 MOST DANGEROUS IT WILL BE 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.321
 What have they done to me? 

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:01.311
 What I am ? 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:04.438
 It can not be undone! 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:09.672
 Do not be so sure! 

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:11.499
 Wolverine immortal
