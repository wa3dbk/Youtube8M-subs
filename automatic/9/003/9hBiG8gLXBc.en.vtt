00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Today Stavropol scientists continued 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 scrutinize the mysterious remains 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.109
 from an ancient mound recently 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.599
 discovered on the banks of the river Kuban 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.849
 the find baffled even the wicked 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.679
 types of anthropologists during the excavation they 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.070
 discovered a beautifully preserved 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 animal skeleton with human head 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.970
 scientific especially pseudo-scientific circles 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 the most incredible appeared immediately 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.019
 assumptions to figure out which 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.590
 the name of this unique artifact 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 Invented not fiction lovers about the most 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 that neither is a conservative scholars 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.260
 ancient burial in hidden during 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 excavation was discovered something strange 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
 Baranovsky forest human skull 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.070
 more elegant definition than human 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 ram archeologists pick up their finds 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.980
 Could not what it is human ram 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 that is, there was a combination of a skull 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 a young man under 25 years old and the body 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 sheep here and so it was all 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.289
 But in this position, Sergei Savin to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 one of the discoverers of human rams 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.250
 head initially climbed not scientific thought but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.690
 suddenly stavropol archeology 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.909
 discovered a previously unknown 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 humanity is an anomalous being to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 in vain not to disturb the flags of the skeleton 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.799
 sent for examination found one 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.689
 1 analogy even geographically wrong 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.909
 far is the territory of Crimea 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 the burial of man there the skeleton was 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.680
 almost full but the arms and legs were 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.240
 canceled until summer until elbow joints and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.860
 animal bones were presented 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 presumably when goats are specialists 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.130
 anthropologists have denied all 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.020
 fantastic theories but not one of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060

 can excite the imagination not 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 only archaeologists and buried 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.560
 the middle ages is all that horses 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.149
 know some information about the very 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 ritual specialists may not have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.970
 because similar artifacts on

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.319
 some kind of anti-scientific shade nearby 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.569
 from the first find 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.030
 the expedition accidentally unearthed the remains

 see how he shed light on 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.440
 origin of unique artifacts 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.450
