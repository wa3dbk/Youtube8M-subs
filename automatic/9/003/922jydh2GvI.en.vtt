as<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.900> cat-scratch<00:00:01.319> and<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.890> my

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
as this cat-scratch and this is my

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:11.930 
as this cat-scratch and this is my
nature<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.610> semi-auto<00:00:03.210> VSS<00:00:10.759> alright<00:00:11.759> this

nature to the semi-auto VSS alright this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.730 
nature to the semi-auto VSS alright this
is<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.210> looks<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.420> firing<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> VSS<00:00:13.440> out<00:00:13.650> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
is what looks like firing the VSS out of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.340 
is what looks like firing the VSS out of
this<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.009> target<00:00:14.690> you're<00:00:15.690> essentially

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this and target you're essentially

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.870 
this and target you're essentially
trying<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.680> approach<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.400> automatic

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
trying to approach that my automatic

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.250 
trying to approach that my automatic
fire<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.449> you're<00:00:18.600> doing<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.930> automatic

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
fire but you're doing with automatic

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.230 
fire but you're doing with automatic
weapon<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.859> don't<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.670> real<00:00:21.029> control

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
weapon so you don't have real control

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.550 
weapon so you don't have real control
over<00:00:21.420> whether<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.050> you're<00:00:22.199> shooting<00:00:22.410> one

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
over whether or not you're shooting one

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.960 
over whether or not you're shooting one
or<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.800> bullets<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> time

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
or two bullets at a time

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.439 
or two bullets at a time
we<00:00:24.840> fired<00:00:25.050> too<00:00:25.199> fast<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:26.099> end<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.939> lot

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
we fired too fast you end up with a lot

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.859 
we fired too fast you end up with a lot
of<00:00:27.480> spread<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> obviously<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> doesn't<00:00:29.010> work

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
of spread and obviously it doesn't work

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
of spread and obviously it doesn't work
we<00:00:30.869> switch<00:00:31.140> over<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.809> semi-auto<00:00:33.809> mode

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we switch over to the semi-auto mode

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.100 
we switch over to the semi-auto mode
using<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> script<00:00:35.120> fire<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.390> fast<00:00:36.719> here

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
using the script fire pretty fast here

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.299 
using the script fire pretty fast here
and<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.829> spreading<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> little

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and you can see I'm spreading a little

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.080 
and you can see I'm spreading a little
bit<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.700> firing<00:00:38.969> too<00:00:39.090> fast<00:00:40.700> you<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.850> over

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
bit so I'm firing too fast you go over

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.290 
bit so I'm firing too fast you go over
and<00:00:42.360> watch<00:00:42.510> again<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.640> firing<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:45.239> too

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and watch again this is firing way too

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
and watch again this is firing way too
fast<00:00:45.600> than<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.800> not

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
fast than you can see so you're not

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.290 
fast than you can see so you're not
changing<00:00:47.129> any<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> fundamental<00:00:47.969> aspects

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
changing any of the fundamental aspects

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.010 
changing any of the fundamental aspects
of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> gun<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:50.210> firing<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
of the gun you're just firing and this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
of the gun you're just firing and this
is<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> ideal<00:00:52.590> scenario<00:00:52.829> where<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> fire<00:00:54.000> at

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is the ideal scenario where you fire at

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
is the ideal scenario where you fire at
the<00:00:54.239> prek<00:00:54.420> speed<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> put<00:00:55.710> five<00:00:56.129> or

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the prek speed and you can put five or

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.560 
the prek speed and you can put five or
six<00:00:56.430> bullets<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> same<00:00:57.030> spot<00:00:57.270> exactly

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
six bullets on the same spot exactly

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.520 
six bullets on the same spot exactly
very<00:00:58.260> quickly

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.990 

walls<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.070> fight<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> took

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
walls don't really fight back so I took

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
walls don't really fight back so I took
some<00:01:03.359> gameplay<00:01:04.019> clip<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
some gameplay clip so you can kind of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.780 
some gameplay clip so you can kind of
see<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.250> talking<00:01:05.580> about

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
see what I'm talking about

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.859 
see what I'm talking about
if<00:01:05.939> you've<00:01:06.090> ever<00:01:06.210> used<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> gun<00:01:06.689> before

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
if you've ever used the gun before

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
if you've ever used the gun before
you'll<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> real<00:01:07.770> difference<00:01:08.159> between<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you'll see a real difference between the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
you'll see a real difference between the
way<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.689> way<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:09.960> using<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> way

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
way it's the way I'm using it the way

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
way it's the way I'm using it the way
you've<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:11.010> been<00:01:11.400> using<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you've probably been using it in the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
you've probably been using it in the
past<00:01:14.570> all<00:01:15.570> right<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> big

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
past all right so this is kind of a big

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.550 
past all right so this is kind of a big
deal<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:17.189> getting<00:01:17.610> three<00:01:18.000> kills<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.560> three

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
deal I'm getting three kills here three

deal I'm getting three kills here three
independent<00:01:19.830> kills<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.270> same<00:01:21.479> clip<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
independent kills on the same clip and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.289 
independent kills on the same clip and
that's<00:01:22.170> something<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:23.729> cannot<00:01:24.030> do

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that's something they really cannot do

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.960 
that's something they really cannot do
with<00:01:24.450> any<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.750> assault<00:01:25.229> rifle<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.880> even<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.590 

the<00:01:45.979> really<00:01:46.700> neat<00:01:46.850> things<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.179> can<00:01:47.360> note
