it<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.340> be<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.550> difficult<00:03:13.730> with<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.210> local

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
it can be really difficult with a local

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.590 
it can be really difficult with a local
scene<00:03:14.990> not<00:03:15.200> cooperating<00:03:15.920> but<00:03:16.340> again<00:03:17.060> ggpo

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
scene not cooperating but again ggpo

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.570 
scene not cooperating but again ggpo
should<00:03:17.930> hopefully<00:03:18.200> solve<00:03:18.680> anyone's<00:03:19.130> problem

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
should hopefully solve anyone's problem

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.770 
should hopefully solve anyone's problem
with<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.180> would<00:03:20.360> be<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.540> huge

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
with that and that would be a huge

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.480 
with that and that would be a huge
problem<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.500> game<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:21.680> skullgirls<00:03:22.310> like

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
problem for a game like skullgirls like

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.240 
problem for a game like skullgirls like
a<00:03:22.580> massive<00:03:22.900> scene<00:03:23.900> killing<00:03:24.230> problem<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.890> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
a massive scene killing problem if it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.920 
a massive scene killing problem if it
didn't<00:03:25.520> have<00:03:25.640> good<00:03:25.910> netcode<00:03:26.330> but<00:03:26.570> because<00:03:26.900> of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
didn't have good netcode but because of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.920 
didn't have good netcode but because of
the<00:03:27.320> gGPO<00:03:27.770> promise<00:03:28.250> i<00:03:28.430> think<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:29.510> game<00:03:29.660> might

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
the gGPO promise i think the game might

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.740 
the gGPO promise i think the game might
have<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.140> good<00:03:30.770> life<00:03:30.890> in<00:03:31.070> front<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.750> I've

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
have a good life in front of it I've

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.000 
have a good life in front of it I've
never<00:03:32.960> actually<00:03:33.440> played<00:03:35.020> homage<00:03:36.020> like<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> GP

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
never actually played homage like a GP

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.610 
never actually played homage like a GP
ggpo<00:03:37.700> things<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.330> don't<00:03:38.780> really<00:03:38.960> I<00:03:39.410> don't

ggpo things I don't really I don't
really<00:03:39.800> know<00:03:40.100> how<00:03:40.130> good<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.910> network<00:03:41.240> is

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
really know how good the network is

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.600 
really know how good the network is
everybody<00:03:42.350> keeps<00:03:42.560> saying<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:43.070> perfect

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
everybody keeps saying it's like perfect

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.910 
everybody keeps saying it's like perfect
close<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.120> no<00:03:44.300> lag<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.080> guess<00:03:45.560> closes

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
close to no lag but I guess closes

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.870 
close to no lag but I guess closes
you're<00:03:46.070> gonna<00:03:46.220> get<00:03:46.460> ya<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:49.310> waiting<00:03:49.850> for

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
don't believe it until I play on it

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.470

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
myself well like the way is explained to

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.120 
myself well like the way is explained to
me<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:56.960> I'm<00:03:57.050> sure<00:03:57.080> somebody<00:03:57.710> will<00:03:57.770> correct<00:03:58.010> me

me and I'm sure somebody will correct me

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.250 
me and I'm sure somebody will correct me
if<00:03:58.220> I'm<00:03:58.340> wrong<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:59.480> know<00:03:59.570> how<00:03:59.720> when<00:04:00.140> you

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
if I'm wrong but you know how when you

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260 
if I'm wrong but you know how when you
press<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> button<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:01.130> sends<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.610> signal<00:04:02.060> and

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
press a button it sends the signal and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.900 
press a button it sends the signal and
once<00:04:02.680> both<00:04:03.680> players<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.280> server<00:04:04.520> have<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
once both players of the server have the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.410 
once both players of the server have the
signal<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.330> starts<00:04:05.660> animating<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.260> move<00:04:07.420> yeah

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
signal it starts animating the move yeah

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.350 
signal it starts animating the move yeah
that<00:04:08.780> adds<00:04:09.020> additional<00:04:09.500> delay<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.400> when<00:04:11.210> the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
that adds additional delay to when the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.580 
that adds additional delay to when the
move<00:04:11.510> comes<00:04:11.720> out<00:04:11.900> after<00:04:12.080> you<00:04:12.230> press<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
move comes out after you press the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.880 
move comes out after you press the
button<00:04:13.270> ggpo<00:04:14.270> manipulates<00:04:14.990> some<00:04:15.230> things<00:04:15.560> so

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
button ggpo manipulates some things so

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.050 
button ggpo manipulates some things so
that<00:04:16.040> like<00:04:16.250> let's<00:04:16.400> say<00:04:16.460> a<00:04:16.549> move<00:04:16.730> has<00:04:16.880> eight

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
that like let's say a move has eight

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.270 
that like let's say a move has eight
frames<00:04:17.270> to<00:04:17.480> start<00:04:17.720> up<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.710> you<00:04:18.890> press<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
frames to start up if you press the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.770 
frames to start up if you press the
button<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:19.730> there's<00:04:19.940> four<00:04:20.090> frames<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.540> delay

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
button and there's four frames of delay

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.350 
button and there's four frames of delay
it<00:04:21.109> skips<00:04:21.710> four<00:04:22.250> frames<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.820> move<00:04:23.000> start

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it skips four frames of the move start

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.930 
it skips four frames of the move start
up

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
up

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.490 
up
basically<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.210> know<00:04:26.350> manipulates<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
basically you know manipulates the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.670 
basically you know manipulates the
emulation<00:04:27.860> or<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.639> game<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:29.300> come<00:04:30.229> out<00:04:30.380> closer

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
emulation or the game to come out closer

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.249 
emulation or the game to come out closer
to<00:04:31.039> when<00:04:31.190> they<00:04:31.310> were<00:04:31.370> supposed<00:04:31.759> to<00:04:31.910> come<00:04:32.030> out

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
to when they were supposed to come out

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.499 
to when they were supposed to come out
that's<00:04:33.259> crazy<00:04:33.680> yeah<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.639> guess<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.090> roll<00:04:35.270> backs

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
that's crazy yeah I guess you roll backs

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.110 
that's crazy yeah I guess you roll backs
when<00:04:35.690> what<00:04:35.960> put<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.100> wouldn't<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.520> skip

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
when what put but wouldn't that skip

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.020 
when what put but wouldn't that skip
frames<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.020> actual<00:04:39.380> game<00:04:39.410> yeah<00:04:40.190> yeah<00:04:40.699> any

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
frames in the actual game yeah yeah any

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.189 
frames in the actual game yeah yeah any
what<00:04:41.210> happened<00:04:41.449> yeah<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.870> doesn't<00:04:42.139> look

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
what happened yeah and it doesn't look

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.950 
what happened yeah and it doesn't look
like<00:04:42.789> offline<00:04:43.789> like<00:04:44.210> because<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.750> actually

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
like offline like because it actually

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200 
like offline like because it actually
skips<00:04:45.380> animation<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.220> things<00:04:46.639> will<00:04:46.940> move

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
skips animation and things will move

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.969 
skips animation and things will move
around<00:04:47.509> when<00:04:47.810> there's<00:04:47.900> problems<00:04:48.229> it'll<00:04:48.740> it'll

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
around when there's problems it'll it'll

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.330 
around when there's problems it'll it'll
roll<00:04:49.520> back<00:04:49.699> and<00:04:50.030> fix<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.389> problem<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:52.190> like

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
roll back and fix the problem so like

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.740 
roll back and fix the problem so like
there<00:04:52.550> may<00:04:52.639> be<00:04:52.669> some<00:04:52.970> networking<00:04:53.270> problem

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
there may be some networking problem

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.210 
there may be some networking problem
where<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.990> see<00:04:54.169> your<00:04:54.320> fireball<00:04:54.710> hit<00:04:54.889> but<00:04:55.100> it

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
where you see your fireball hit but it

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.100 
where you see your fireball hit but it
didn't<00:04:55.490> actually<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:56.090> guy<00:04:56.180> jumped<00:04:56.419> over<00:04:56.780> so

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
didn't actually the guy jumped over so

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.870 
didn't actually the guy jumped over so
it'll<00:04:57.320> roll<00:04:57.470> back<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:58.310> what<00:04:58.759> is<00:04:58.849> actually

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
it'll roll back to what is actually

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.790 
it'll roll back to what is actually
happening<00:04:59.300> you'll<00:04:59.900> be<00:04:59.990> like<00:05:00.110> but<00:05:00.289> I<00:05:00.320> hit<00:05:00.590> him

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
happening you'll be like but I hit him

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.589 
happening you'll be like but I hit him
you<00:05:01.160> know<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.430> didn't<00:05:01.820> actually<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.300> was<00:05:02.419> just

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
you know you didn't actually it was just

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.240 
you know you didn't actually it was just
the<00:05:02.660> networking<00:05:02.960> problem<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.949> that<00:05:04.039> freaks

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
the networking problem and that freaks

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.129 
the networking problem and that freaks
people<00:05:04.430> out<00:05:04.699> but<00:05:04.759> it<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.300> lot<00:05:05.539> more<00:05:05.690> accurate

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
people out but it is a lot more accurate

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.909 
people out but it is a lot more accurate
than<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.289> alternative<00:05:08.680> that's<00:05:09.680> kind<00:05:09.889> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
than the alternative that's kind of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.219 
than the alternative that's kind of
weird<00:05:10.099> it<00:05:10.789> works<00:05:11.090> really<00:05:11.330> well<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.870> know<00:05:11.990> we

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
weird it works really well you know we

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.080 
weird it works really well you know we
call<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.650> roll<00:05:12.860> back<00:05:13.190> but<00:05:13.490> that's<00:05:13.639> kind<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:13.970> a

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
call it roll back but that's kind of a

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.820 
call it roll back but that's kind of a
misnomer<00:05:14.300> what<00:05:14.900> it<00:05:15.020> really<00:05:15.169> should<00:05:15.470> be<00:05:15.500> is

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
misnomer what it really should be is

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.830 
misnomer what it really should be is
kind<00:05:16.039> of<00:05:16.130> like<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.280> roll<00:05:16.550> forward<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:17.270> imagine

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
kind of like a roll forward like imagine

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.170 
kind of like a roll forward like imagine
you<00:05:18.349> have<00:05:18.560> two<00:05:19.160> separate<00:05:19.550> copies<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.150> game

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
you have two separate copies of the game

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.659 
you have two separate copies of the game
instead<00:05:21.080> of<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.380> game<00:05:21.560> being<00:05:21.860> resolved<00:05:22.310> in

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
instead of the game being resolved in

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.370 
instead of the game being resolved in
the<00:05:22.729> middle<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.389> they're<00:05:23.690> being<00:05:23.870> input<00:05:24.259> delay

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380

there<00:05:24.710> your<00:05:25.370> game<00:05:25.699> is<00:05:26.000> basically<00:05:26.479> running<00:05:27.020> at

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
there your game is basically running at

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.670 
there your game is basically running at
high<00:05:27.680> fidelity<00:05:27.860> as<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.400> could<00:05:28.580> be<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:29.500> when<00:05:30.500> you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
high fidelity as it could be so when you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.430 
high fidelity as it could be so when you
do<00:05:30.919> something<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.580> happened<00:05:32.150> now<00:05:32.750> what<00:05:33.320> you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
do something it happened now what you

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.050 
do something it happened now what you
see<00:05:33.620> on<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.860> screen<00:05:33.949> may<00:05:34.370> not<00:05:34.639> completely

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
see on the screen may not completely

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.379

match<00:05:35.570> what<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.139> supposed<00:05:36.289> to<00:05:36.560> happen<00:05:36.620> but<00:05:37.389> you

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
match what is supposed to happen but you

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.240 
match what is supposed to happen but you
know<00:05:38.659> that<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.020> did<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.289> dragon<00:05:39.800> punch<00:05:39.979> and

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
know that you did that dragon punch and

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.370 
know that you did that dragon punch and
then<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.610> didn't<00:05:40.820> come<00:05:40.970> out<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.360> when<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.139> play

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
then it didn't come out so when you play

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.469 
then it didn't come out so when you play
a<00:05:42.409> game<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.680> ggpo<00:05:43.220> do<00:05:43.849> you<00:05:43.970> know<00:05:44.180> that<00:05:44.389> the

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
a game of ggpo do you know that the

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.360 
a game of ggpo do you know that the
Dragon<00:05:44.810> Punch<00:05:44.960> didn't<00:05:45.229> come<00:05:45.380> out<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:45.979> might

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
Dragon Punch didn't come out you might

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.520 
Dragon Punch didn't come out you might
not<00:05:46.610> see<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.970> for<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.300> frame<00:05:47.570> or<00:05:47.599> two<00:05:47.900> but<00:05:48.349> then

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
not see it for a frame or two but then

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.920 
not see it for a frame or two but then
it'll<00:05:48.710> come<00:05:48.889> out<00:05:49.039> so<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:50.180> players<00:05:50.449> that<00:05:50.780> are

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
it'll come out so for players that are

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.800 
it'll come out so for players that are
hardcore<00:05:51.500> like<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:51.860> said<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:53.120> actually<00:05:53.570> works

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
hardcore like you said it actually works

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.399 
hardcore like you said it actually works
because<00:05:54.169> you<00:05:55.099> know<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:56.060> know<00:05:56.630> what<00:05:57.349> you're

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
because you know you know what you're

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.279 
because you know you know what you're
doing<00:05:57.949> and<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:59.180> expect<00:05:59.539> the<00:05:59.630> screen<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:00.050> match

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
doing and you expect the screen to match

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.510 
doing and you expect the screen to match
what<00:06:00.500> you're<00:06:00.650> doing<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:01.009> that's<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.310> problem

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
what you're doing and that's the problem

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.070 
what you're doing and that's the problem
that<00:06:01.699> we<00:06:01.820> have<00:06:02.090> with<00:06:02.120> input<00:06:02.539> delay<00:06:02.690> so<00:06:02.840> the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
that we have with input delay so the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.379 
that we have with input delay so the
screen<00:06:03.349> will<00:06:03.759> eventually<00:06:04.759> correct<00:06:05.090> itself

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
screen will eventually correct itself

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.029 
screen will eventually correct itself
that's<00:06:05.630> really<00:06:05.870> what<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.080> right<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.710> you<00:06:06.860> can

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
that's really what it right and you can

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.159 
that's really what it right and you can
react<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.550> things<00:06:07.729> like<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.449> can't<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:08.870> in

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
react to things like you can't and in

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.749 
react to things like you can't and in
the<00:06:09.320> traditional<00:06:09.770> netcode<00:06:10.070> you<00:06:10.220> can't<00:06:10.460> react

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
the traditional netcode you can't react

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.999 
the traditional netcode you can't react
online<00:06:11.210> that's<00:06:11.509> the<00:06:11.630> problem<00:06:11.900> oh<00:06:12.199> yeah<00:06:12.440> but<00:06:12.860> in

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009
