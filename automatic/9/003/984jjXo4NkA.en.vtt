00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.399

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
 It's an automobile dogma I think it's about 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.570
 the feminine and it stays well my style that is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.549

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.060
 I really like pink lipstick and I think 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.590
 that I do not live without the pink lipstick 41 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.000
 social is with the lipstick per month 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.769
 5 which last button you bought 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.489
 Look, I remember it's been a while. 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.760
 even I was thinking of buying a 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.940
 col lipstick 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 he's hers 155 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:35.019
 I love coral a little more 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.390
 pulled out of pink 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:44.200
 beautiful and I loved it was the last one I 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.030
 I bought for promptly I know 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.510
 button that you regretted having 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.420
 bought look at all the lipsticks I 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.150
 I bought it and I love it, I do not have to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.190
 I did not like what I normally look 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.620
 I chose well I like choosing the color 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.810
 who's more to do with me, I'm very 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.910
 to try different things 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.209
 so there are not any that I have 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.760
 understood the question to question number 7 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.910
 Your lipstick, darling of the moment 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.049
 Of course my conquest at the moment is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.340
 this one is the bee queen he was 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.340
 especially while the mouth 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.879
 He's in the moment, so when I think 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.569
 that when he does away with football 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.610
 8 your most expensive and the cheapest lipstick is 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 Well, finally I do not usually pay 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.300
 a lot and button 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.250
 I'm paid but at the cheaper brands 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.879
 because I think they are super firm 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.220
 states and several super just then I 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:08.870
 I do not have the indicated button so I guess 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:15.200
 the button later z of avon natura 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.590
 It should be more of the avon and the blood color in the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.590
 body 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.669
 I do not know how much he fought but I think 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.669
 it is more expensive than, say , 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.580
 which is the codex to inspire the name of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.820
 Taiwanese do not ask for Paraiba 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.669
 help me then I think the one of the clothes was 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.169
 marked was the cheapest of the two 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.930
 I love 91 just one wish from the moment 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.330
 logical that the desire of the moment is the bill 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.389
 I really wanted to meet this one. 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.700
 lipstick and I have not used it but I have not seen 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.660
 I took it easy, I already got the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.300
 agehab 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.880
 but I could not really use it myself 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 I wanted to have the logical path, no question 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.470
 number 10 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.530
 do you like ama or are you addicted to the tip 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:22.930
 Look, I think I love the button, not only. 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:22.930
 By passing day but 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.120
 and in some of Brazil, but I think 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.590
 That I love lipsticks is that 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 always when I can buy when I 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.540
 I can not go on the hill too. 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.510
 I do not think there question number 11 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.180
 send a kiss to a special person 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.940
 tell which button it matches or does 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.420
 remember that it is logical that the 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.180
 Special of telling my mother. 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:57.940
 honey and my mother, I love you so much 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.960
 is this lipstick here the chayo litigant is 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.630
 of the weak 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.730
 I love this sharp turn I think 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.030
 they super match with my mother 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.010
 He's kind of a wine, I think he is. 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.200
 the face of my mother because mom likes to 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.080
 pink lipsticks so I think it matches with 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:20.740
 she and pink lipsticks reminds me that 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:22.600
 base is good then but that 's it then 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.980
 It ended our tag which I hope 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.190
 did you like 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.900
 I think I liked it to help me in the 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.810
 dissemination of the video, it is expected that my 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.210
 channel and if you have any 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.030
 Preferred if you're crazy too if you 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.590
 loves to like button reporters o 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.890
 also clear that it only reinforces that I 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.790
 I loved it, it's good, so this is super 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.130
 kiss 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.130
 stay with god and see you next time
