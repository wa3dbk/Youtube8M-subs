00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone I hope you meet 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 very good today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.630
 let's say as special about the first 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 pokemon pokemon designs that never 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 they came out and modifications I had already 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.470
 done this video but I do not know why 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.690
 sony vegas reason I started to take 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 a lot of time in rendering as much as 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470
 I do it again because it seems that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 He kept well what I did with the text 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.599
 very good enough talk and start with 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 the video the pokemon and the characters 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 that we know are just some of the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.690
 that created game freak over time 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.760
 many beta characters were 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.860
 eliminated being impossible to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 get this does not appear even in the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.480
 videogames in its final version or in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 manga and I can only see this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 in beta games very well 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 let's start already very well start with the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.129
 unknown pokemon ag no mus and it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 know that it was plant-type bar 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.750
 bug his name in Spanish would be insect 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.030
 shadow was from the beta versions of gold 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 and silver it is known that I could learn 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.040
 hard-fought fortress and tackle this pokemon 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.990
 is very similar to seward leia that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 they have the same 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.899
 and by appearance only a little curious the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090
 only information that is known about 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.670
 of this creature is his name and image 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.600
 in the pokémon demo gold and silver its 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.130
 212 in the national pokedex was 212 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.470
 belonged to the water type and knew the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.429
 movements growling tackle and pistol 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.110
 Water 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.149
 this pokemon is said to be the pre 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.369
 evolution of the brass but I think that 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.619
 was going to be the pre-evolution of that the 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.600
 they seem very much possess the water type and its 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.640
 color is white that's the only thing 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.530
 I can also say that in the second 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.020
 generation came out the baby pokemon 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.610
 so there are many possibilities tell me 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.360
 what do you think of this pokemon in the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.490
 comments or do not know few things 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 about his name comes from the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.140
 combination of two flames and kuma bear 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.600
 has almost the same characteristics of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.000
 rage in the beta versions of gold and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.549
 silver this was game type and I knew 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.220
 malicious attacks scratch and embers 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.140
 I do not have words for this pokemon the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.209
 I really do not know much about this pokemon 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.009
 but as they say in forums this could 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.530
 having been the first fifth design 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 kill me I do not think it was the first one says 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.070
 Put me what they think about this 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.070
 pokemon in the comments because the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.200
 I really do not know anything about him hehe pokemon without 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.810
 name this pokemon was not given 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.420
 name its appearance is like a mixture 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.460
 of fable and a lot though and mont 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 gets the rotating shaft in the head and 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
 he has it at the bottom of his 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.820
 body so I believe this pokemon 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.890
 could have been the first design of the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.810
 total amount once the fourth evolution of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 shot that I would stay with the fourth 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.880
 evolution of shot that maybe this would be 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.010
 its defensive evolution turtle without 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.950
 name this pokemon was not given 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.590
 name looks a lot like turtle but it 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.720
 does not know his type was scheduled to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.640
 the second generation I believe that the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.800
 design of this pokemon could have been 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.320
 used later for the paint design 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.480
 very well I do not know hehehe this is also 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.700
 I leave you I could not inform 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 of nothing else just saying he could 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 be rock type and water and the possible 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.140
 possible that generation 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.480
 nothing is known about this pokemon that 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.600
 not their number Pokédex number 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.640
 124 the same as jeans 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.160
 This number is also shared with 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.310
 qatar foot as its index number this 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.380
 Pokemon left me speechless for you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.300
 nothing is known about this pokemon that 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.840
 not their small number of c's the 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.750
 number 211 the same as wifi again 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 without words x of very well make a 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.250
