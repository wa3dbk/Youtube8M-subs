 To make our child's head better, eat a lot of iron. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.210
 You should have heard it. 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.779
 I asked the citizens directly.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:42.699
 There's a way to go from there to the media. 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.699
 I guess you do. 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:54.710
 So I know I heard there was going the tide coming l iron massager as a bone 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.820

 Actually many people on the mass 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.940
 I believe that if I eat a lot of iron, I get better hair. 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.760
 I really wonder if this is true. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:22.100
 So I met an expert myself. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:27.560
 Well, I have not been here in Korea before. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.330
 It appeared in time due to nutritional imbalance dropped a lot of nutrition Sorry 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.550
 I think it is 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:39.560
 I do not think there's any research showing that when I eat a lot of iron, my brain gets better. 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.790
 Tandago want to say to the couple's gwonhaeju If one pharmacist in the pharmacy

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.820
 We recommend you to eat more and therefore to continue the Cyprus Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.140
 The brain needs nutrient oxygen work 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.700
 Eating food is nutrition among them. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.200
 These days, a lot of instant food and Thanh flooded many people came out to see me 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 These things 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.160
 You can reduce brain function that bad except when writing chapters mwonyamyeon

 Therefore, any time of carbonated drinks just food 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.220
 And it is better to avoid the instant food 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 4 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.750
 Then I would have seen 2 4 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:00.500
 Good food for the brain is typical 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.500

 It was good that the myth that was eventually not true 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.520
 There is a lot of false myths about the fact that our country has a high education 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.650
 It exists. 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:41.180
 This unproven enough to cause solo because right pl 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.780
 Parents should pay special attention to avoid false myths. 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.780
 I will. 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.450
