difficult thing I've ever done in gaming
not<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.050> literally<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
not just because you literally have to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
not just because you literally have to
be<00:01:01.770> perfect<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.579> anyone<00:01:03.000> dies<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:04.739> puts

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
be perfect and if anyone dies it puts

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.649 
be perfect and if anyone dies it puts
the<00:01:05.580> entire<00:01:05.700> boss<00:01:06.360> fight<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.810> jeopardy<00:01:07.400> but

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
the entire boss fight in jeopardy but

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.530 
the entire boss fight in jeopardy but
you<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> coordinate<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:11.180> six-man<00:01:12.180> team

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you have to coordinate a six-man team

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.710 
you have to coordinate a six-man team
and<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.450> as

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and there are it's not just it's not as

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
and there are it's not just it's not as
simple<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> shooting<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> boss<00:01:16.920> there

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
simple as just shooting the boss there

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
simple as just shooting the boss there
are<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.150> mini<00:01:18.479> games<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.110> each<00:01:19.350> boss<00:01:19.680> fight

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
are like mini games in each boss fight

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
are like mini games in each boss fight
and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.390> sure<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.689> you're

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and you have to make sure that you're

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
and you have to make sure that you're
coordinating<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> paying<00:01:22.770> attention<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
coordinating and paying attention to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
coordinating and paying attention to
each<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.830> very
