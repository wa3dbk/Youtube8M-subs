it looks really powerful and dangerous

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.300 
it looks really powerful and dangerous
so<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.450> think<00:00:50.690> that<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.200> sort<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.010> sort<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
so I think that is sort it's sort of the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:01.670 
so I think that is sort it's sort of the
bad<00:00:52.489> boy<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.180> know

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 

the<00:01:01.980> task<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.490> usual<00:01:02.970> was<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.510> build<00:01:03.750> something

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the task as usual was to build something

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
the task as usual was to build something
that<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.620> go<00:01:04.830> fast<00:01:05.150> make<00:01:06.150> turns<00:01:06.480> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that could really go fast make turns you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.300 
that could really go fast make turns you
know<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> usual<00:01:07.940> outrageous

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
know the usual outrageous

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.860 
know the usual outrageous
parameter<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.330> had<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> belong<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
parameter it really had to belong to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.650 
parameter it really had to belong to
same<00:01:13.170> family<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> Batmobile<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.150> that's

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
same family as the Batmobile so that's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.640 
same family as the Batmobile so that's
where<00:01:15.870> we<00:01:15.990> started<00:01:17.600> I'd<00:01:18.600> hesitate<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.410> even

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
where we started I'd hesitate to even

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.800 
where we started I'd hesitate to even
call<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.460> motorcycle<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.660> it's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
call this a motorcycle just because it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.900 
call this a motorcycle just because it's
so<00:01:22.050> different<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> way<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> motorcycle

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
so different from the way a motorcycle

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.490 
so different from the way a motorcycle
typically<00:01:24.570> handles<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> mean<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.229> isn't

superhero tech what I love about that is

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.890 
superhero tech what I love about that is
the<00:05:28.250> sense<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.700> these<00:05:29.389> things<00:05:29.600> really<00:05:29.780> are

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
the sense that these things really are

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.510 
the sense that these things really are
possible<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:30.889> that<00:05:31.010> makes<00:05:31.220> him<00:05:31.370> much

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
possible I think that makes him much

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.219 
possible I think that makes him much
more<00:05:31.729> relatable<00:05:32.150> because<00:05:32.510> Batman's<00:05:33.020> very

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
more relatable because Batman's very

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.580 
more relatable because Batman's very

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
much a human being in stories of that

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.090 
much a human being in stories of that
fantasy<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.580> man<00:05:38.090> who<00:05:38.360> through<00:05:38.630> sheer

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
fantasy of a man who through sheer

self-discipline turned himself into a
heroic<00:05:42.050> figure<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.620> think<00:05:42.919> that's<00:05:43.100> just<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:43.370> very

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
heroic figure I think that's just a very

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.820 
heroic figure I think that's just a very
compelling<00:05:43.880> myth<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.419> never<00:05:45.200> said<00:05:45.470> thank<00:05:45.710> you
