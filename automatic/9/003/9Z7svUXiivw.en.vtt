you to use your 3d apps or even maybe

your DS as a controller for the wii u

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and all he would say is that he could

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.559 
and all he would say is that he could
not<00:03:37.579> comment<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.540> at<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:38.720> time<00:03:40.569> that

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
not comment on that at this time that

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.229 
not comment on that at this time that
sounds<00:03:42.230> kind<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.739> yes<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.069> me<00:03:43.400> if<00:03:43.849> it

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
sounds kind of like a yes to me if it

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.849 
sounds kind of like a yes to me if it
were<00:03:44.359> not<00:03:44.419> possible<00:03:45.139> i<00:03:45.290> think<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.709> probably

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
were not possible i think you probably

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.440 
were not possible i think you probably
would<00:03:46.130> have<00:03:46.220> been<00:03:46.280> forthcoming<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.269> that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
would have been forthcoming with that

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.539 
would have been forthcoming with that
would<00:03:47.720> have<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.079> said<00:03:48.319> no<00:03:48.590> that's<00:03:49.370> not

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
would have just said no that's not

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.339 
would have just said no that's not
something<00:03:50.060> we<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.329> in<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.569> works<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.049> it

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
something we have in the works but it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.140 
something we have in the works but it
sounds<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.950> may<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.280> something<00:03:52.910> that

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
sounds like that may be something that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.180 
sounds like that may be something that
they'll<00:03:53.750> want<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.200> announce<00:03:54.500> at<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.889> later<00:03:55.099> date

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
they'll want to announce at a later date

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.900 
they'll want to announce at a later date
and<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.209> makes<00:03:56.389> sense<00:03:56.660> because<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:58.220> 3ds<00:03:58.579> has

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
and it makes sense because the 3ds has

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.930 
and it makes sense because the 3ds has
touchscreen<00:03:59.780> ability<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.880> just

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
touchscreen ability on it and it just

why not just use that for your touch
screen<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.579> sounds<00:04:16.880> pretty<00:04:17.120> cool<00:04:17.389> but

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
on it at this time so we'll have to wait

really be anything other than that

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.670 
really be anything other than that
they're<00:05:06.740> certainly<00:05:07.099> not<00:05:07.189> going<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.669> do<00:05:07.909> it

they're certainly not going to do it
much<00:05:09.680> lower<00:05:09.979> than<00:05:10.159> that<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.520> couldn't<00:05:11.000> imagine

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
much lower than that I couldn't imagine

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.749 
much lower than that I couldn't imagine
that<00:05:11.599> they'll<00:05:11.750> actually<00:05:11.900> do<00:05:12.289> a<00:05:12.319> 250<00:05:13.099> price<00:05:13.400> for

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
that they'll actually do a 250 price for

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.629 
that they'll actually do a 250 price for
it<00:05:13.879> as<00:05:14.240> far<00:05:14.629> as<00:05:14.659> above<00:05:15.469> that<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.979> just<00:05:16.339> really

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
it as far as above that I just really

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.559 
it as far as above that I just really
can't<00:05:16.669> see<00:05:17.150> them<00:05:17.330> doing<00:05:17.539> 350<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:20.389> will

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
can't see them doing 350 it it will

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.689 
can't see them doing 350 it it will
limit<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:21.289> amount<00:05:21.379> of<00:05:21.680> people<00:05:21.740> who<00:05:22.279> are<00:05:22.400> able

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
limit the amount of people who are able

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.969 
limit the amount of people who are able
to<00:05:22.789> purchase<00:05:23.029> their<00:05:23.689> console<00:05:24.589> and<00:05:24.770> that's

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
to purchase their console and that's

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.800 
to purchase their console and that's
something<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.460> they<00:05:25.699> strive<00:05:26.180> for<00:05:26.509> us<00:05:26.599> to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
something that they strive for us to

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.869 
something that they strive for us to
make<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.199> console<00:05:27.710> as<00:05:28.069> affordable<00:05:28.819> as

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
make the console as affordable as

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.909 
make the console as affordable as
possible<00:05:28.969> so<00:05:29.689> as<00:05:29.719> many<00:05:30.229> people<00:05:30.710> as<00:05:30.740> possible

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
possible so as many people as possible

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.579 
possible so as many people as possible
can<00:05:31.699> get<00:05:31.909> them<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.449> I<00:05:32.659> really<00:05:33.259> think<00:05:33.409> it's

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:33.589 
can get them so I really think it's

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.740 
can get them so I really think it's
going<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.770> be<00:05:33.889> 2<00:05:34.069> 99<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.849> it's<00:05:35.089> a<00:05:35.300> little<00:05:35.539> silly

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
going to be 2 99 and it's a little silly

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.570 
going to be 2 99 and it's a little silly
that<00:05:36.080> they<00:05:36.199> won't<00:05:36.349> just<00:05:36.589> confirm<00:05:37.099> that<00:05:37.310> price

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
that they won't just confirm that price

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.490 
that they won't just confirm that price
since<00:05:37.939> it's<00:05:38.120> filmmakers<00:05:38.689> everywhere<00:05:39.169> but

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
since it's filmmakers everywhere but

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.740 
since it's filmmakers everywhere but
we're<00:05:40.219> just<00:05:40.370> gonna<00:05:40.490> have<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:40.849> wait<00:05:41.000> for<00:05:41.029> that

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
we're just gonna have to wait for that
