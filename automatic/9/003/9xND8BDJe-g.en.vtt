basically be found in any of us and it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
basically be found in any of us and it
is<00:01:08.729> most<00:01:09.150> prevalent<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.290> children

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
is most prevalent when we are children

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.399 
is most prevalent when we are children
as<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.670> required<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> refuge<00:01:12.930> tissue

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
as it is required for the refuge tissue

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
growth that occurs at this stage in life

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
growth that occurs at this stage in life
however<00:01:17.100> after<00:01:17.430> puberty<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.600> HGH<00:01:19.229> levels

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
however after puberty those HGH levels

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
however after puberty those HGH levels
starts<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> decline<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> body<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
starts to decline in the body and it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.850 
starts to decline in the body and it
continues<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:24.119> become<00:01:24.479> adults

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
continues to do so as we become adults

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
continues to do so as we become adults
that's<00:01:25.860> why<00:01:26.189> many<00:01:26.670> bodybuilders<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:28.229> those

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that's why many bodybuilders see those

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's why many bodybuilders see those
HGH<00:01:29.340> injections<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> means<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.500> build

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
bigger muscles however as I already said

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.160 
bigger muscles however as I already said
there<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.280> also<00:01:35.490> many<00:01:35.790> natural<00:01:36.119> ways<00:01:36.689> to

there are also many natural ways to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.670 
there are also many natural ways to

reported<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.510> ani<00:02:17.930> would<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.769> up<00:02:19.069> at<00:02:19.340> 3am<00:02:19.700> in

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
reported that ani would get up at 3am in

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.729 
reported that ani would get up at 3am in
the<00:02:20.300> morning<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.870> do<00:02:21.440> weight<00:02:21.709> training

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the morning and do weight training

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.240 
the morning and do weight training
sessions<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.300> his<00:02:23.450> HGH<00:02:24.230> levels<00:02:24.590> were<00:02:25.040> at

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
sessions so that his HGH levels were at

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.610 
sessions so that his HGH levels were at
their<00:02:25.489> highest<00:02:25.819> he<00:02:26.780> would<00:02:26.959> then<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.379> back<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
their highest he would then go back to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.460 
their highest he would then go back to
bed<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> proper<00:02:29.150> sleep<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.750> showing

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
bed and have a proper sleep and showing

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.320 
bed and have a proper sleep and showing
more<00:02:30.739> HGH<00:02:31.220> would<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.580> released<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:32.090> thus

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
more HGH would be released and thus

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.050 
more HGH would be released and thus
increasing<00:02:32.989> muscle<00:02:33.110> growth<00:02:33.849> well<00:02:34.849> obviously

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
increasing muscle growth well obviously

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.600 
increasing muscle growth well obviously
you<00:02:35.900> don't<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.379> be<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.680> crazy<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.580> I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you don't have to be that crazy but I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.390 
you don't have to be that crazy but I
think<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.239> proves<00:02:38.510> our<00:02:38.780> point<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.500> by

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
think this proves our point that by

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.759 
think this proves our point that by
sleeping<00:02:40.910> enough<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.470> raise<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
sleeping enough you really can raise the

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.410 
sleeping enough you really can raise the
HDH<00:02:43.610> levels<00:02:44.440> well<00:02:45.440> apart<00:02:46.099> from<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.430> HGH

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
HDH levels well apart from that HGH

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.289 
HDH levels well apart from that HGH
levels<00:02:47.810> are<00:02:48.079> also<00:02:48.470> naturally<00:02:49.310> increased<00:02:49.730> when

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
levels are also naturally increased when

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.690 
levels are also naturally increased when
you<00:02:50.420> work<00:02:50.599> out<00:02:50.840> as<00:02:51.170> weight<00:02:52.040> training<00:02:52.489> has<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
you work out as weight training has a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.449 
you work out as weight training has a
very<00:02:53.090> beneficial<00:02:53.329> effect<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.079> them<00:02:54.459> so

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
very beneficial effect on them so

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.369 
very beneficial effect on them so
getting<00:02:55.940> down<00:02:56.269> through<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.660> gym<00:02:56.900> will

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
getting down through the gym will

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.300 
getting down through the gym will
actually<00:02:58.099> help<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:58.970> itself<00:02:59.120> and<00:03:00.310> as

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
actually help in and of itself and as

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.819 
actually help in and of itself and as
you<00:03:01.579> get<00:03:01.760> older<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.540> simply<00:03:03.079> counteract

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
you get older you simply counteract

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.430 
you get older you simply counteract
lower<00:03:04.129> HGH<00:03:04.790> levels<00:03:05.060> by<00:03:05.450> training<00:03:05.780> harder<00:03:06.260> and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
lower HGH levels by training harder and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.550 
lower HGH levels by training harder and
getting<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.370> sleep<00:03:07.810> also<00:03:08.810> ensure<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.410> you

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
getting more sleep also ensure that you

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.080 
getting more sleep also ensure that you
have<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.680> good<00:03:09.890> diet<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.610> should<00:03:10.790> never

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
have a good diet and you should never

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.809 
have a good diet and you should never
need<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.420> consider<00:03:11.930> HGH<00:03:12.590> injections<00:03:12.819> because

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
need to consider HGH injections because

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.020 
need to consider HGH injections because
you<00:03:14.390> simply<00:03:14.720> don't<00:03:15.110> need<00:03:15.440> them<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:16.970> a
