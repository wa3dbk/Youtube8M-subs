00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 in this video I will show how 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:22.470
 prepare the baked cheese bread 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:25.619
 an easy and fast way a cream cheese 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 philadelphia 190 grams a can of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 condensed milk a can of milk 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 evaporated 4 eggs 2 molds to pay 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 with cookie crust 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.790
 I am using these because they are 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.010
 much more economical and practical when 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 we are not very expert in making the base 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 of cookies can be bad because 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 accommodate us the crust we can put 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 in thinner parts and in other 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 thicker parts and the part that remains 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 closed is burned as it is thicker 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.289
 that remains raw in two countries are 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 to sell these coasts have 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.960
 perfectly done I paid 50 pesos 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 for four of these the Ombudsman I get it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 much cheaper to buy the dates 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 to buy the cookie and the butter 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 if you wanted to make a crust of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 cookies move a pack of cookies 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 Maria with a butter bar 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.009
 melted in the microwave the mixture and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.440
 already they accommodate it in their mold that they go to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 use but for me it is much more 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.180
 practical that and I'm going to use two because 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.280
 these ingredients reach us for 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 make two countries as the ingredient 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 additional I'm going to use a couple of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 teaspoons cornstarch this is optional 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.910
 I put it on so that it comes out more hard 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.800
 the country we are also going to occupy two 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.750
 teaspoons of vanilla essence 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.270
 before starting with the preparation 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.330
 We are going to preheat the oven to 200 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 degrees centigrade I already put here the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.369
 cream cheese this is the easiest and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 quick to do let's put all the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.920
 ingredients now I'm going to put the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.659
 milks have to be removed with the spatula 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.429
 the condensed milk because it comes very 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.090
 thick and so that it does not remain to seize 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.219
 in the tin 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.219
 we also put the evaporated milk 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.880
 let's put the four eggs 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 if you do not have much confidence in 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.740
 that the eggs come out good because 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 sometimes they do not come out in perfect condition 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.480
 we put the eggs in a container 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 and then we put them in the blender 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.580
 Sometimes the egg goes wrong and if 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.470
 we throw away everything that is already 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.870
 we have in the blender now I'm going to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.870
 put 2 teaspoons cornstarch 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 this is not necessary is optional I just 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.760
 I put last sight that it becomes damn and 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.520
 We are going to put two teaspoons of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.300
 Vanilla can put a new two here 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.020
 the vanilla is a pleasure I'm going to put 2 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.020
 now we are going to liquefy 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.690
 let's remove the reason is the base me 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.790
 love more both is more when it's for 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.400
 drink because we no longer have to buy 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.959
 the bunch nothing this capital we're going to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 book because we will take the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.480
 final when the bread is ready 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.250
 we put and we close here and they are 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.099
 ready to sell now simply 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.760
 let's put the mixture in each of 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.760
 the country 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.690
 this reaches perfectly for both 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.030
 Now I'm going to wait another five 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.400
 minutes because this I did not even in 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.349
 five minutes and it's still not hot 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.480
 the furnace I'll wait another five 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.910
 minutes so you have about 10 minutes 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.290
 in the oven that is preheating 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.610
 after 10 minutes that I undertook in the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.610
 200 degree oven 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.489
 I'm going to lower it to 180 degrees centigrade 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.580
 and I'm going to put them in the oven for space 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.800
 of 45 minutes you have to take them to the oven 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.150
 very carefully because this is very 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.190
 liquid and it's very full we can 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.100
 throw in the road we can burn to the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.230
 putting it in the oven in this way is more 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.069
 easy to take it to the oven I left them 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.769
 50 minutes because at 45,000 that 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.620
 it was still not well cooked be it 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.380
 let's take out 47 minutes and this one does 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.760
 the 50 minutes when they are hot 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 is going to raise this is a little bit 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.870
 raised but this is the bank is 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.330
 Like this one because it it out 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 first to know if they are already cooked 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.710
 what I did is that I put a stick 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.080
 in the middle 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.670
 and if the puppy knows in bernardo de 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.980
 mixing means that it is not yet 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.750
 cooked when the stick already knows 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.810
 completely dry that we introduce the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.180
 stick and does not know in beast then that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.890
 means that it's already cooked I'm going to 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.960
 wait for them to cool a bit to 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.900
 put them in the refrigerator because the country 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.300
 of cheese is served the side the pay of 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.850
 cheese you can eat so naturally nothing 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.950
 more we split it as if it were pizza with 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.900
 a knife we make a cut 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.220
 we make in the form of triangles 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.340
 but this time I'm going to 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.440
 decorate can also decorate them 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.340
 i 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.340
 or 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.430
 one 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.220
 here what I'm doing just 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.550
 I'm covering the whole country with some 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.550
 cherries 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.639
 since I covered all the bread with the cherries 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.789
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to put 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:39.550
 a bit of strawberry jelly 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:42.610
 this is jelly or strawberry class 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.150
 and this is nothing more than covering all 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.150
 cherries 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.190
 This is a way we can 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.620
 decorate this I put a little bit of 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.669
 strawberry quality now I put a little 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.039
 of cream 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.080
 these three cherries to decorate and to 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.240
 final report a little bit of cream 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.030
 around the price that they will give for 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.970
 sell are 120 if they make us without 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.800
 decorate and if it goes without decorations in 150 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.169
 this is the way they prepare the 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.090
 cheese countries baked in a way 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.400
 easy and fast I hope you liked it 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.860
