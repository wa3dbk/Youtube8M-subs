00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.840 
if you do that fast I need practice
there<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> couple<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.160> times<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.580> will<00:02:13.670> be

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
there a couple of times it will be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.120 
there a couple of times it will be
pretty<00:02:14.060> much<00:02:14.410> foolproof<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.680> their<00:02:15.830> own<00:02:15.980> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
pretty much foolproof and their own a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.040 
pretty much foolproof and their own a
have<00:02:16.280> done<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.610> then<00:02:17.030> all<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.510> need<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.810> try

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
have done it then all you need to try

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.350 
have done it then all you need to try
and<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:18.890> Jack<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.340> Diamonds<00:02:19.490> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
and do is get this Jack of Diamonds to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.100 
and do is get this Jack of Diamonds to
the<00:02:20.480> bottom<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.350> deck<00:02:21.560> okay<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.840> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the bottom of the deck okay so you do a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.490 
the bottom of the deck okay so you do a
couple<00:02:24.530> fake<00:02:24.770> shuffle<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> shuffle

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
couple fake shuffle so you shuffle

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.350 
couple fake shuffle so you shuffle
holding<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.980> jack<00:02:28.190> o<00:02:28.220> diamonds<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.910> your<00:02:29.180> hand

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
holding the jack o diamonds in your hand

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360 
holding the jack o diamonds in your hand
like<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.870> getting<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.190> bottom

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
like that and getting it to the bottom

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.920 
like that and getting it to the bottom
of<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> day<00:02:31.820> that<00:02:32.000> might<00:02:32.210> take<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.450> bit<00:02:32.630> of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
of the day that might take a bit of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.100 
of the day that might take a bit of
practice<00:02:33.050> but<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.710> pretty<00:02:34.040> simple<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:35.570> then

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
practice but it's pretty simple and then

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.190 
practice but it's pretty simple and then
you<00:02:36.650> go<00:02:36.890> through<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.250> deck<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.810> up<00:02:38.930> you

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you go through the deck and then up you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.380 
you go through the deck and then up you
do<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.400> sloppy<00:02:40.700> shuffle<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.270> an

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
do this and the sloppy shuffle is an

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.140 
do this and the sloppy shuffle is an
actual<00:02:41.750> factor<00:02:42.080> trick<00:02:42.380> shuffle<00:02:42.800> because<00:02:43.160> all

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
actual factor trick shuffle because all

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.380 
actual factor trick shuffle because all
you're<00:02:44.360> doing<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:45.050> putting<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> cards

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
you're doing is just putting the cards

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.170 
you're doing is just putting the cards
facedown<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.810> face<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:48.970> they're<00:02:49.970> not

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
facedown and face up so they're not

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.760 
facedown and face up so they're not
actually<00:02:50.390> getting<00:02:50.810> shuffled<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.590> much

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
actually getting shuffled that much

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.160 
actually getting shuffled that much
they're<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:52.250> some<00:02:53.209> cards<00:02:53.570> facedown<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
they're just some cards facedown and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.500 
they're just some cards facedown and
some<00:02:54.500> cards<00:02:54.800> face<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.030> when<00:02:56.180> you've<00:02:56.330> gone

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
some cards face up and when you've gone

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.210 
some cards face up and when you've gone
through<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> deck<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.140> done<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.560> every

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
through the deck and done that every

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.550 
through the deck and done that every
five<00:02:58.520> cars<00:02:58.850> are<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.420> flip<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.930> then<00:03:00.410> you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
five cars are so just flip and then you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.170 
five cars are so just flip and then you
get<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.040> last<00:03:01.280> card<00:03:01.580> which<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.820> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
get to the last card which is the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.300 
get to the last card which is the
spectator<00:03:02.660> scarred<00:03:03.020> Jack<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.890> Diamonds<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
spectator scarred Jack of Diamonds and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.880 
spectator scarred Jack of Diamonds and
you<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.640> pop<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:04.940> facedown<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.350> top<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
you just pop that facedown on top of the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.190 
you just pop that facedown on top of the
deck<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.790> square<00:03:08.090> up<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.360> deck<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.780> in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
deck and you square up the deck and in

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.310 
deck and you square up the deck and in
actual<00:03:09.470> fact<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.830> deck<00:03:10.040> looks<00:03:10.310> like<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:11.320> see

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
actual fact the deck looks like this see

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.310 
actual fact the deck looks like this see
so<00:03:12.680> half<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.580> up<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.930> other<00:03:15.110> half's

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
so half of it is up and the other half's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.979 
so half of it is up and the other half's
down<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.790> card<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.330> here's<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.780> Jack

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989

of Diamonds yet so this is the hard part

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.750 
of Diamonds yet so this is the hard part

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
which can completely mess up the trick

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.150 
which can completely mess up the trick
is<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.390> need<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> bit<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:23.870> luck<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.650> find<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
is you need a bit of luck you find the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.460 
is you need a bit of luck you find the
break-in<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:26.360> find<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> part<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.260> deck

break-in you find the part on the deck

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.070 
break-in you find the part on the deck
which<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.769> here<00:03:28.100> see<00:03:28.400> there<00:03:28.850> two<00:03:29.120> backs<00:03:29.810> are

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
which is here see there two backs are

which is here see there two backs are
down<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:31.040> then<00:03:31.280> you've<00:03:31.489> got<00:03:31.700> all<00:03:32.209> those<00:03:32.510> cards
