00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.620
 forcing the bike on the streets so pay 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.300
 attention to these three traps that can 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:20.179
 play in the ground 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:20.179
 [Music] 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.430
 the first one is the channel she can 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.320
 come out of nowhere in the middle of your path 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.360
 this channel is the same one found 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 gas stations and here it is in the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.940
 it's very wide 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.940
 cover 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.920
 nor the mountain bike tire is escapes and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.480
 if you drop it here it's very difficult 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.480
 leaving does not give time and you can not 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.670
 pulling the channel becomes more dangerous 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.739
 in a situation like this a crossing 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.989
 with a roundabout here the cars are 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.900
 forced to invade part of this 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.640
 where the channel is set not by 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.920
 their fault but for the design of the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 finish time bouquet against her shape 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.550
 correct to pass this here is this 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.950
 way 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.950
 [Music] 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 never walk parallel to the next channel 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
 This way because if you fall, it will not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 getting out is going to be very difficult 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:24.120
 Escape From The Fall The Second Traps 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.100
 are the holes the mouths of the wolf hole 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.330
 dangerous is the one you do not see because 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.470
 when you see you deviate 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.470
 [Music] 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.710
 this type of trap is the most dangerous 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.780
 because if you are following a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.789
 car it will pass a wheel of each 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.619
 side and you right in the middle will be 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.899
 surprised by this hole 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.520
 In this case the tip is not to stick 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.890
 cars so you have time to divert 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.679
 the hole that the car already sent to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 third trap is to walk in the gutter 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.700
 if you do not occupy the lane the vehicle will 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.640
 want to share space with you then 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.920
 walk well in the middle of the track try to pass 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.410
 in space like this one that here is alright 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 large is very dangerous because the pedal 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.940
 can either pick up on the sidewalk or on the spine and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.220
 It gives a beautiful tumble 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.989
 you can spend in a space of 100 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.910
 pedal so as not to risk the pedal 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.640
 pick up but depending on the height of the guide 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.769
 still it can lean are in the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.569
 doubt occupy your space in the pass band 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.829
 over the spine like the others 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.480
 vehicles 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.370
 if you're not paying attention 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 any of these obstacles can 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.560
 to bring down a spine 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.109
 hole the channel up to these brick 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940
 which make the rounds mainly 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.890
 for people who do not hold a new 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.230
 correctly leaves the thumb on top 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.470
 along with the other fingers fighting in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.590
 handlebars and you're going to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 [Music] 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.370
 observing this simple tip you do not 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.330
 back side of the house cost us if 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.550
 see there in future videos that does not 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.870
 walk very close to each 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.570
 Do not walk too close to the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.980
 My goodness, I do not go to the club. 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.510
 of crying trap most dangerous caring 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:32.490
 one look at the level of the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:34.650
 mouth-to-mouth trap because the one who 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.900
 You see you do not but I had to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.140
 explain first and you right in the middle will 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.910
 to fall right here was not quite what 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.760
 thinks the following it will centralize 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:51.720
 this here he will not pass over the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:54.770
 this obstacle to total shopping 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.770
