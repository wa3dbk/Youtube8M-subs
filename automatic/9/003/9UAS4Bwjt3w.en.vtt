00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 i love berliner that 's 29 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.620
 men because of incidents 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 I got over with you some time ago 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.929
 the problem of my big belly 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.210
 spoken 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 I have a lot of helpful tips from 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 get you and I have one now 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.400
 found the solution I believe for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.480
 I worked and I wanted 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 share with you today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 Among other things, she has with me the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 article by steffi cook despite a whole 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.430
 great side of also one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 Challenger in spite of her 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 numerous food allergies 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.040
 has a dividend of exchange 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 not just her own yogurt, but 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 your own bread is also leaving 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.989
 so for example a gluten 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 incompatibility or against soja 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.750
 you are allergic then you can open 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 look over her blog 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.350
 the synonymous had the problem with the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 playboy up and have it with you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.280
 solved a trick of food 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.899
 Combining calls therefore the order of the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.430
 to observe food 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.260
 I got a bit into this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 read in and I have to say that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
 it makes a lot of sense for me to do it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 is mainly about the fact that the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 digestibility of the food 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 foods containing a lot of water 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 like, for example, are just a lot 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 easier to digest than for example 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 bold story told with the compass 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.159
 stomach does not digest like me 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.229
 Everything had been assumed 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.540
 together in a thick not black 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 but the processed is really like that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 how to consume it for layer 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.880
 layer that means just when one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 food that very much water 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 includes like fruits and vegetables 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 actually very easily digestible 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 But now it has to be in the back and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 wait until first maybe the the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 fat layer so if you have a finished 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 eat yesterday until it's digested and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 only then comes the fruits come 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 come the melons and then you have to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 wait and then it goes to the puffs 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 the construction among others on and now 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 Looking back, I have to say 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.759
 that I really always have a lot of fruit 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.399
 especially as a dessert 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.049
 because yes I love props and finds 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.909
 actually a great dessert but 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.490
 I just have that a bit now 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.820
 omitted 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.250
 it helps and is actually also melons 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.690
 just water in principle that should 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.790
 It is best only in the morning 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.989
 and eat on empty stomach and now 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.400
 I just made that way 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.930
 always in the morning a piece of melon 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.180
 expressed and only afterwards my 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.019
 oatmeal or my amaranth whether or not 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.610
 What ever 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.620
 The principle of the dead at youngest 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.510
 simply the easily digestible first 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.010
 who should be eaten 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.110
 Read a little more into the topic 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.849
 I will want below the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.040
 link articles from the steffl 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.380
 as well as a food combining charlie 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.390
 where you can see what kind of food 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.920
 which food works well 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.930
 this little trick pretty much mix 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.549
 I definitely want to buy, too 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.410
 make a blood picture all over again 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.209
 sure to rule out that I do not 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.319
 gluten intolerance I have 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.790
 not really many 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.200
 symptoms but I always wanted to anyway 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.630
 ever make a blood picture 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.980
 if I test the same and still 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.620
 In addition, maybe I will become one 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.170
 certain food groups times separately 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.849
 eat to see if my body is there 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.200
 to also somehow reacts differently 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.060
 many said if i might be a soja 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.820
 incompatibility I have something for me 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.609
 actually would be terrible if I mean 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.079
 so yogurt now really love 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.600
 my soymilk i mean i love too 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.519
 oat milk especially those of all 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.549
 nature's with calcium and that's the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.010
 make a choice with a little cinnamon 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.239
 happy a soya allergy would be for 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.709
 me, though, are a bit too 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.079
 too bad I hope that it really is not 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.670
 but if that's what I'm up to 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.470
 I'll know that, of course 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 let an important tip with what 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.799
 has helped a lot is just way 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.870
 to drink more water 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.730
 I just watched that me 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.680
 actually drink less than me 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.140
 I had wanted to do that 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
 a two liters a day but create 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.040
 somehow so with all lies one to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.180

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.530
