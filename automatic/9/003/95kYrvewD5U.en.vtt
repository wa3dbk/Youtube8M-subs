00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
using the program a little bit more fun

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.680 
using the program a little bit more fun
now<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> lot<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> people<00:00:14.849> when<00:00:15.150> they<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.480> see

now a lot of people when they first see

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.630 
now a lot of people when they first see
kind<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> base<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.500> lot<00:00:16.800> there's<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> lot<00:00:17.310> going

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
kind of base a lot there's a lot going

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.220 
kind of base a lot there's a lot going
on<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:17.820> where<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.510> even<00:00:18.600> start

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
on here where do I even start

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
on here where do I even start
and<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.680> true<00:00:19.949> there's<00:00:20.520> over<00:00:20.730> half<00:00:20.760> a

million issues built right into the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.439 
million issues built right into the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
program when you start and our guys are

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.790 
program when you start and our guys are
adding<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> couple<00:00:24.930> thousand<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.500> every

adding a couple thousand more every
month<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> keep<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> wacky

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.939 
goings on the world of comic books now
the<00:00:29.910> reason<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.740> reason

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the reason they do all this the reason

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.139 
the reason they do all this the reason
they<00:00:32.040> build<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.399> much<00:00:32.489> information<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
they build so much information in the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
they build so much information in the
program<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> make<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.500> really

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
program is to make it so you really

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
program is to make it so you really
don't<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> want

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

as I type the first couple letters it
automatically<00:01:05.369> chases<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> want

to go so it really gives me there very

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.380 
to go so it really gives me there very
quickly<00:01:08.850> here's<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.840> second<00:01:10.229> series<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
quickly here's the second series and if

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
quickly here's the second series and if
you'll<00:01:12.570> notice<00:01:12.780> despite<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.710> this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
you'll notice despite all this

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.020 
you'll notice despite all this
information<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.399> database<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.940> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
information in the database all the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
information in the database all the
quantities<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.630> start<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.140> zero<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
quantities all start out at zero and the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
quantities all start out at zero and the
conditions<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.100> start<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.610> near-mint

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
conditions all start out at near-mint

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.240 
conditions all start out at near-mint
and<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> makes<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.890> easy<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and so this is makes it very easy to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
and so this is makes it very easy to
just<00:01:20.399> add<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.729> own<00:01:20.819> book<00:01:21.090> by<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.780> fine

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just add your own book by it that's fine

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
just add your own book by it that's fine
in<00:01:22.170> number<00:01:22.470> 12<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.490> gonna<00:01:23.640> change<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
in number 12 here I'm gonna change that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.130 
in number 12 here I'm gonna change that
coin<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> zero<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
coin from a zero to a one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.499 
coin from a zero to a one
