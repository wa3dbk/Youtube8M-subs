00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.200
 a little introduction to that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.910
 multiplayer area and bochum 2 that is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 now here is the campaign multiplayer 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 campaign and that puts the player out 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.700
 you can choose trendy 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 fractions so on could then 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 Invite a friend or friend here 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.279
 The just in the lobby open and you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.060
 could be the typical settings 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.039
 make 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 the problem is again a bit 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.119
 it is only man versus man or 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.349
 Only two players speak cooperatively 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 in my opinion are again 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 missed a big chance as he 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 turn-based strategy, there will always 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.980
 another mystery why two players 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 must be maximum but it is unfortunately 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 means the campaign will use two 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.309
 with each other or against each other that is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 What we can have then I have 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 seen in multiplayer battles there are 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.610
 only more players fighting that means so 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 in principle you have what shogun 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.890
 was without this campaign card 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 avatars sort veteran units one 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.190
 stuff 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 he is now out so have that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.820
 her no longer Japan's rudimentary systems 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.750
 can imagine as well as the office mainz 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 also the case was 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.939
 depending on the animal slaughter and then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 is in principle also going on yes that is 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.780
 actually so far everything the whole 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.640
 then works so that while there is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 Rank is now such a funny one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.630
 as well as people already in there 'come to my 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.460
 then look inside the fast the vessel 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.900
 clicks then he makes so renk 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.040
 play well ranked players and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.200
 a number of people that we have seven 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 he made seven victories so more games 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.840
 seven games which, of course , two more 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.150
 hours is very hardcore and some 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 people ask early at long energy 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 get to know shogun the place 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.579
 have always been pressure but very 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 pleasant to play with him where it is not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.869
 be the same 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 and yes as running halt ye again 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.060
 So as I said no avatar mode can 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.100
 nothing at all just simple battles 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 either in countries with automatic or 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700
 next to homemade games and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.840
 I can show that just now 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.189
 and every game is about to fight 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.299
 can set event times but 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.770
 What do not we want to go in ? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 Provided 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 and yes that's a bit of a disappointment 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.500
 because this level 3 watts scenes 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.000
 was shogun 2 motivated a lot of fun 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.979
 I am very sad that is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 you did not take in you can you 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.870
 also mineral vein commander strategist 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 The only always after their reverberation 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.550
 cramming something because it needs 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 continue with because and that is not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.209
 was the same reason was with shoes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 yes and that was it actually 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.180
 Only here could everything be here 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.500
 adjust card advantage with the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.780
 card seems to be that he is this time 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 the card could just see something 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.090
 displayed is clicked on the record ago 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.709
 now dead 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.640
 ok karthagos down there would have been wonderful 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.010
 actually hoping that I am here now 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.569
 front carthago can see because there is one 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.819
 problem in the maps the predecessor building 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.099
 always that one stops which I know which 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.870
 something is beat before than once has 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.430
 memorized the funny names 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.709
 where are the men actually there 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.010
 to be actually out ok then 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.260
 that fits well is one of them 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.300
 we can change the scale though 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.860
 here I stand now campaign card but 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.590
 In fact, that has no influence 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.750
 on the brain campaign as me so 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 this somehow progresses or 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.560
 so must be able to click here 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.360
 then you have in this area and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.560
 more highest for example above more forest 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.769
 but it is not me 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.830
 yes and that's just in my view 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.120
 actually a bit thin 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.010
 You will then have the information 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.019
 the attitudes and that was sexy 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.819
 multiplayer so multiplayer extremes 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.470
 So if your job is in multiplayer 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.750
 then want to play is actually 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.099
 already two the best choice because there has 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.650
 the multicar actually a lot 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.450
 choosing a lot of motivation and here 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.500
 you have unfortunately only slaughter must then 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.909
 it does not mean that it is 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.459
 uninteresting is just for the 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.930
 langzeitmotivation a pity for 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.220
 I still okay because we are not 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.230
 Battles are a lot of fun 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.519
 unit diversity and so on that is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.840
 the advantage of ronan that one 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.030
 archive picture has in comparison to the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.500
 play another then that fits too 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.420
 So I'll definitely be in the future 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.610
 make multiplayer battles here as 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 show him a two 33 and have got so far 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.510
 i all butcher comments free house 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.069
 delivered but only for all the stop 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.569
 now a better multiplayer between 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.400
 they probably will have expected 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.840
 the scope is probably the most that at least 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840
 be a bit disappointed
