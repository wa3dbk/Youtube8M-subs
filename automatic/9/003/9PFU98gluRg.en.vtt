all<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.070> bases<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.970> once<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> is

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
all my bases here so this once it is

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.270 
all my bases here so this once it is
from<00:00:57.660> Jets<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.770> dressing<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.220> your

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

from Jets and when dressing for your
body<00:00:59.520> shape<00:00:59.790> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> most<00:01:00.329> important

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
body shape I think the most important

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.090 
body shape I think the most important
thing<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.860> have<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
thing is that you really have to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
thing is that you really have to
accentuate<00:01:02.550> what's<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.149> best<00:01:03.390> feature

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it does exaggerate my waist gives her

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.330 
it does exaggerate my waist gives her
the<00:01:06.390> support<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> bus<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the support on the bus and also the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070

also have ruching at the side so that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910
