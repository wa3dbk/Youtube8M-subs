 half a cup of Oaxaca cheese tortillas

 large flour and for the sauce that I think 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830

 and I was going to add the onion 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.970
 delicious and notice that it is very true 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.660
 that depends on where one lives with whom 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.270
 where you live is your kitchen I 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.690
 our environment our entire environment is not 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.210
 simple in itself at the time of cooking well 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.220
 complicated because we have to cook 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.010
 locally so as not to contaminate the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.079

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.569
 ricota el rico has a very low flavor 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.440
 and we want a stronger flavor that 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.489
