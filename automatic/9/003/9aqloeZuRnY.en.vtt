00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.890 
don't measure it it just makes me think
I<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.920> what<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:08.790> even<00:03:09.330> just<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.870> I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
I know what I like so even just that I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110 
I know what I like so even just that I
don't<00:03:10.140> say<00:03:10.320> that's<00:03:10.470> half<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.190> cup<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.910> takes

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
don't say that's half a cup it takes

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.430 
don't say that's half a cup it takes
away<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> little<00:03:12.510> bit<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> creaminess<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
away a little bit of the creaminess and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.699 
away a little bit of the creaminess and
it<00:03:13.590> adds<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.010> solid<00:03:14.520> back<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.440> think

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
it adds like a solid back in so I think

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.800 
it adds like a solid back in so I think
that's<00:03:17.459> where<00:03:17.640> we're<00:03:17.760> gonna<00:03:17.820> end<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.180> up<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.540> do

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that's where we're gonna end it up I do

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.270 
that's where we're gonna end it up I do
add<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> little<00:03:19.350> bit<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> lemon<00:03:19.830> juice<00:03:19.980> which

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
add a little bit of lemon juice which

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.650 
add a little bit of lemon juice which
I'm<00:03:20.400> gonna<00:03:20.550> do<00:03:20.700> right<00:03:20.850> now<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.120> add<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> little

I'm gonna do right now just add a little
bit<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> zest<00:03:22.489> cooking<00:03:23.489> because<00:03:23.760> we're<00:03:23.880> true

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
can stick to them a little bit better

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.950 
can stick to them a little bit better
and<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.670> I'm<00:04:30.820> gonna<00:04:30.910> take<00:04:31.240> some<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.900> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
and then I'm gonna take some of the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.310 
and then I'm gonna take some of the
filling<00:04:32.110> on<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> spoon<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.670> just<00:04:34.200> spread<00:04:35.200> it

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
filling on a spoon and just spread it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.170 
filling on a spoon and just spread it
onto<00:04:35.500> them<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.920> because<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.670> made<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.060> much

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
onto them and because we made so much

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.700 
onto them and because we made so much
filling<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.660> there's<00:04:37.780> only<00:04:37.960> seven<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.560> these

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
filling and there's only seven of these

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.260 
filling and there's only seven of these
you<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.070> make<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.400> really<00:04:39.610> nice<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.060> thick
