00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.160 

it's<00:03:51.900> called<00:03:52.050> ward<00:03:52.440> sliver<00:03:53.270> right<00:03:54.270> here<00:03:54.570> top

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
it's called ward sliver right here top

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.820 
it's called ward sliver right here top
right<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:56.490> says<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.630> has<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:57.930> for<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.680> a

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
right it says it has this for in a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.330 
right it says it has this for in a
circle<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.940> next<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.420> there's<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.690> plane's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
circle the next to it there's a plane's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.220 
circle the next to it there's a plane's
simple<00:04:02.340> means<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.120> needs<00:04:03.240> one<00:04:03.480> plane<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.990> for

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
simple means it needs one plane in for

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.750 
simple means it needs one plane in for
