00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
that's who what map and the time period

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.730 
that's who what map and the time period
no<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.790> opinion<00:01:39.270> who<00:01:40.049> let's<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.560> I

no as for my opinion who let's see I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
no as for my opinion who let's see I
think<00:01:40.920> Jay<00:01:41.430> nasty<00:01:41.850> honestly<00:01:42.270> has<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> best

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
think Jay nasty honestly has the best

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.410 
think Jay nasty honestly has the best
shot<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.549> personally<00:01:45.210> it's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
shot I think you know personally it's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
shot I think you know personally it's
really<00:01:45.720> easy<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.229> biased<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.860> an

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
really easy to be biased because I'm an

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
really easy to be biased because I'm an
amp<00:01:47.189> clin<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.670> obviously<00:01:48.210> Jay<00:01:48.750> nasty<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
amp clin and now obviously Jay nasty is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
amp clin and now obviously Jay nasty is
the<00:01:49.350> leader<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> amp<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.790> trying<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the leader of amp so I'm not trying to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
the leader of amp so I'm not trying to
be<00:01:51.540> biased<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.829> frank<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.310> really

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
be biased here but to be frank I really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
be biased here but to be frank I really
honestly<00:01:54.090> genuinely<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.009> Jay

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
honestly genuinely do think that Jay

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
honestly genuinely do think that Jay
nasty<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> best<00:01:57.030> shot<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
nasty is the best shot at getting the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
nasty is the best shot at getting the
first<00:01:58.320> Texas<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.040> we'll<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.180> he's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
first Texas so we'll see I think he's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
first Texas so we'll see I think he's
got<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> best<00:02:00.899> shot<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.320> he's<00:02:01.799> closely

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
got the best shot I think he's closely

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
got the best shot I think he's closely
followed<00:02:02.700> by<00:02:02.729> dark<00:02:03.149> general<00:02:03.540> who<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> very

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
followed by dark general who was a very

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.920 
followed by dark general who was a very
strong<00:02:04.500> mw3<00:02:05.040> player<00:02:05.490> think<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.210> dgen<00:02:06.600> gets<00:02:06.810> his

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
strong mw3 player think if dgen gets his

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.350 
strong mw3 player think if dgen gets his
mw3<00:02:07.439> shot<00:02:07.860> back<00:02:08.129> he'd<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.239> good

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
mw3 shot back he'd have a really good

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.199 
mw3 shot back he'd have a really good
chance<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.810> well<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.259> no<00:02:10.739> DHT<00:02:11.129> Adam<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.120> he

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
chance as well I no DHT Adam I think he

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
chance as well I no DHT Adam I think he
got<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.510> two<00:02:12.690> pentas

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
got like two pentas

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
got like two pentas
they<00:02:13.620> were<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.830> PC<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.390> he<00:02:15.600> might

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
they were on PC and so you know he might

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.050 
they were on PC and so you know he might
get<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> first<00:02:16.200> hexa<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.800> pc<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.880> frank

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
get the first hexa on pc but to be frank

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.210 
get the first hexa on pc but to be frank
i'm<00:02:18.360> really<00:02:18.630> only<00:02:18.750> counting<00:02:19.230> consoles<00:02:19.950> either

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
i'm really only counting consoles either

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.540 
i'm really only counting consoles either
xbox<00:02:21.000> or<00:02:21.210> ps3<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.740> know<00:02:22.860> he's<00:02:23.070> also<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
xbox or ps3 so you know he's also in the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.460 
xbox or ps3 so you know he's also in the
race<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.300> know<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.600> kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.960> pc<00:02:25.290> guy

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
race but you know he's kind of a pc guy

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.590 
race but you know he's kind of a pc guy
so<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:25.980> bit<00:02:26.100> different<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:27.420> far

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
so it's a little bit different so so far

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.660 
so it's a little bit different so so far
we<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.810> j<00:02:27.990> nasty<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.620> D<00:02:28.770> gin<00:02:29.040> those<00:02:29.550> are

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
we have j nasty we have D gin those are

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
we have j nasty we have D gin those are
the<00:02:29.730> two<00:02:29.970> main<00:02:30.240> guys<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:31.020> both<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the two main guys that I think both have

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
the two main guys that I think both have
like<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.310> shot<00:02:32.550> they're<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> bunch

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
like a really good shot they're a bunch

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.550 
like a really good shot they're a bunch
of<00:02:33.450> other<00:02:33.630> guys<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.080> think<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.470> know

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
of other guys that I think you know

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
of other guys that I think you know
could<00:02:34.740> also<00:02:34.980> potentially<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.030> they

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
could also potentially get it if they

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.060 
could also potentially get it if they
get<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.660> lucky<00:02:37.020> as<00:02:37.110> well<00:02:37.320> but<00:02:37.860> those

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
get a little bit lucky as well but those

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.250 
get a little bit lucky as well but those
two<00:02:38.430> guys<00:02:38.610> d<00:02:38.910> Jen<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> Jay<00:02:39.540> nasty<00:02:39.990> i<00:02:40.020> would

week<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.840> resistance<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:56.040> maybe<00:02:56.190> on

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
week on resistance I think maybe on

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.770 
week on resistance I think maybe on
resistance<00:02:56.940> he<00:02:57.060> might<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.330> able<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.540> hit<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
resistance he might be able to hit the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.380 
resistance he might be able to hit the
hexa<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.410> those<00:02:58.950> three<00:02:59.160> guys<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> I'm<00:03:00.239> not

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.850 
hexa so those three guys and I'm not
counting<00:03:00.540> anyone<00:03:00.959> else<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.290> we'll<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:01.830> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
counting anyone else out we'll see I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.340 
counting anyone else out we'll see I
mean<00:03:01.980> prove<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:03.000> wrong<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.600> let<00:03:04.020> me<00:03:04.050> know<00:03:04.200> who

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
mean prove me wrong so let me know who

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.780 
mean prove me wrong so let me know who
you<00:03:04.440> guys<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.890> we'll<00:03:04.980> get<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.250> Penta<00:03:05.610> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you guys think we'll get the Penta in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.750 
you guys think we'll get the Penta in
the<00:03:06.120> comments<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:06.570> hex<00:03:07.440> excuse<00:03:08.040> me<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.640> been

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the comments or hex excuse me it's been

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.729 
the comments or hex excuse me it's been
a<00:03:08.790> long<00:03:09.000> day<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.330> work<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.350> comments

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
a long day at work in the comments

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.010 
a long day at work in the comments
section<00:03:10.770> down<00:03:11.040> below<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.610> ask<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> map

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
section down below and ask for the map

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.470 
section down below and ask for the map
alright<00:03:13.530> well<00:03:13.680> honestly<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.520> think<00:03:14.640> resistance

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
alright well honestly I think resistance

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.729 
alright well honestly I think resistance
is<00:03:15.890> probably<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.489> most<00:03:17.700> likely<00:03:18.420> map<00:03:19.320> for<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
is probably the most likely map for the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.530 
is probably the most likely map for the
heck<00:03:19.950> said<00:03:20.130> because<00:03:20.489> if<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.209> them<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
heck said because if you get them on the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.270 
heck said because if you get them on the
left<00:03:21.750> hand<00:03:21.930> side<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.530> spawn<00:03:22.799> trap<00:03:23.100> them

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
left hand side you can spawn trap them

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.420 
left hand side you can spawn trap them
so<00:03:23.610> hard<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.590> moon<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.980> map<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.280> we're

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
so hard now the moon the map that we're

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.210 
so hard now the moon the map that we're
on<00:03:26.519> now<00:03:26.760> bootleg<00:03:27.769> potentially<00:03:28.769> although

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
on now bootleg potentially although

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.039 
on now bootleg potentially although
you'd<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> spawn<00:03:30.420> trap<00:03:30.660> part<00:03:30.930> on

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
you'd really have to spawn trap part on

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.630 
you'd really have to spawn trap part on
the<00:03:31.140> right<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.380> think<00:03:31.739> because<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the right I think because I think on the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.370 
the right I think because I think on the
left<00:03:32.850> side<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.209> I'm<00:03:33.360> doing<00:03:33.750> right<00:03:33.780> now<00:03:33.959> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
left side like I'm doing right now I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.780 
left side like I'm doing right now I
don't<00:03:34.739> think<00:03:35.010> you'd<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.130> enough<00:03:35.310> time<00:03:35.580> to

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
don't think you'd have enough time to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.580 
don't think you'd have enough time to
get<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.000> hex<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.480> left<00:03:36.660> side<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.080> who

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
get the hex on the left side but who

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.150 
get the hex on the left side but who
knows<00:03:37.940> mmm<00:03:38.940> arkadin<00:03:39.799> potentially<00:03:40.799> although

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
knows mmm arkadin potentially although

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160 
knows mmm arkadin potentially although
sometimes<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.600> back<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.989> forth

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
sometimes you have to go back and forth

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.569 
sometimes you have to go back and forth
and<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.500> guess<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.950> find<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.340> bad

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
and I guess if you find really bad

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.370 
and I guess if you find really bad
enemies<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.420> could<00:03:45.570> potentially<00:03:45.720> get<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
enemies you could potentially get the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.949 
enemies you could potentially get the
the<00:03:46.920> Moab<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.489> Arkaden<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.239> actually<00:03:48.870> now

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
the Moab on Arkaden and actually now

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.360 
the Moab on Arkaden and actually now
that<00:03:48.989> I'm<00:03:49.260> thinking<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.860> archit<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that I'm thinking about this archit and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.490 
that I'm thinking about this archit and
I<00:03:50.489> completely<00:03:50.970> forgot<00:03:51.540> about<00:03:51.600> amp<00:03:52.019> energized

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
I completely forgot about amp energized

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.410 
I completely forgot about amp energized
I<00:03:52.530> think<00:03:52.920> he's<00:03:53.160> one<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.820> other<00:03:53.970> contenders

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I think he's one of the other contenders

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.420 
I think he's one of the other contenders
for<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> hexa<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.590> far<00:03:55.769> we<00:03:55.920> have<00:03:56.010> D<00:03:56.190> Jen

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
for the hexa so so far we have D Jen

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.850 
for the hexa so so far we have D Jen
chieh<00:03:56.940> nasty<00:03:57.329> amp<00:03:57.540> energized<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.320> guard<00:03:58.620> I

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
chieh nasty amp energized and guard I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.590 
chieh nasty amp energized and guard I
think<00:03:59.250> between<00:03:59.400> those<00:03:59.730> four<00:04:00.030> guys<00:04:00.180> one<00:04:00.570> of

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
think between those four guys one of

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.420 
think between those four guys one of
them<00:04:00.780> will<00:04:00.959> get<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.200> first<00:04:01.410> text<00:04:01.620> although

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
them will get the first text although

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.430 
them will get the first text although
we'll<00:04:02.610> see<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.269> for<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.630> map<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.959> honestly

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
we'll see but as for the map I honestly

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.949 
we'll see but as for the map I honestly
think<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.829> best<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.480> resistance<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:06.810> you

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
think the best is resistance because you

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.539 
think the best is resistance because you
if<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.200> get<00:04:07.410> them<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.739> Left<00:04:07.980> spawn<00:04:08.250> trap

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
if you get them on the Left spawn trap

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.699 
if you get them on the Left spawn trap
you're<00:04:09.000> absolutely<00:04:09.209> unstoppable<00:04:09.900> over<00:04:10.560> there

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
you're absolutely unstoppable over there

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.350 
you're absolutely unstoppable over there
and<00:04:10.829> they<00:04:10.890> just<00:04:11.040> keep<00:04:11.220> spawning<00:04:11.549> there<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.329> I

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and they just keep spawning there so I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.720 
and they just keep spawning there so I
think<00:04:12.480> resistance<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.590> likeliest<00:04:14.070> behind

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
think resistance is the likeliest behind

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.159 
think resistance is the likeliest behind
resistance<00:04:15.269> I'm<00:04:15.420> really<00:04:15.660> not<00:04:15.780> sure<00:04:15.840> what<00:04:16.109> I

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
resistance I'm really not sure what I

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.620 
resistance I'm really not sure what I
put<00:04:16.410> next<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.890> might<00:04:17.400> consider<00:04:17.549> c-town<00:04:18.299> next

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
put next I might consider c-town next

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.000 
put next I might consider c-town next
because<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.200> keep<00:04:19.380> spawning<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.919> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
because if they keep spawning on the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.029 
because if they keep spawning on the
right-hand<00:04:20.400> side<00:04:20.519> you're<00:04:21.150> pretty<00:04:21.419> much<00:04:21.479> set

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
right-hand side you're pretty much set

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.890 
right-hand side you're pretty much set
bootleg<00:04:23.039> not<00:04:23.460> as<00:04:23.640> much<00:04:23.820> only<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.660> don't

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
bootleg not as much only because I don't

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.570 
bootleg not as much only because I don't
know<00:04:24.930> bootleg<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:25.500> seems<00:04:25.680> too

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
know bootleg just seems too

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.369 
know bootleg just seems too
flip<00:04:27.000> sometimes<00:04:27.449> and<00:04:27.750> sometimes<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.110> goes<00:04:28.199> to

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
flip sometimes and sometimes it goes to

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.529 
flip sometimes and sometimes it goes to
the<00:04:28.470> left<00:04:28.590> hand<00:04:28.860> side<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.729> i<00:04:30.000> don't<00:04:30.389> really

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
the left hand side so i don't really

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.869 
the left hand side so i don't really
know<00:04:30.629> about<00:04:30.840> bootleg<00:04:31.349> interchange<00:04:32.280> maybe<00:04:32.669> if

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
know about bootleg interchange maybe if

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.610 
know about bootleg interchange maybe if
you<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.120> against<00:04:33.330> really<00:04:33.629> bad<00:04:33.780> enemies<00:04:34.199> but<00:04:34.439> i

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
you get against really bad enemies but i

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.770 
you get against really bad enemies but i
