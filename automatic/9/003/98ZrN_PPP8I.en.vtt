00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
all notable thing this session i think

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.110 
all notable thing this session i think
is<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.830> actually<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:11.400> through<00:00:11.460> multiple

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
is that we actually got through multiple

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.629 
is that we actually got through multiple
encounters<00:00:12.710> here<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.889> force<00:00:14.099> all<00:00:14.280> been<00:00:14.460> like

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
encounters here to force all been like

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.250 
encounters here to force all been like
pretty<00:00:14.910> much<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.080> more

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
pretty much like one I think more

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
pretty much like one I think more
networked<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:17.160> notably<00:00:19.400> this<00:00:20.400> section<00:00:20.939> and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
networked more notably this section and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.080 
networked more notably this section and
the<00:00:22.050> torture<00:00:22.410> chamber<00:00:22.439> thing<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.310> gotta<00:00:23.850> say<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the torture chamber thing I gotta say I

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820

where I lost my leg and I managed to hop

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
where I lost my leg and I managed to hop
this<00:00:39.450> far<00:00:39.780> before<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.290> lost<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.280> head<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
this far before I lost my head you can

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.500 
this far before I lost my head you can
see<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> trail<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> blood<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.940> introduced

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
see the trail of blood and we introduced

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.369 
see the trail of blood and we introduced
a<00:00:45.690> major<00:00:45.960> villain<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.629> traitor<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.809> her<00:00:49.200> own

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
a major villain a traitor to her own

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.500 
a major villain a traitor to her own
kind<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:51.620> hope<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.129> learned<00:00:53.430> splitting<00:00:54.390> up

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
kind I hope that we learned splitting up

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.189 
kind I hope that we learned splitting up
is<00:00:54.719> dangerous<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> potentially<00:00:55.890> deadly

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
is dangerous and potentially deadly

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.560 
is dangerous and potentially deadly
everyone's<00:00:58.199> looking<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.680> brigham<00:00:59.210> I<00:01:00.210> thought

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
everyone's looking at brigham I thought

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
everyone's looking at brigham I thought
it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> pretty<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.170> plan<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:04.220> thought<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it was a pretty good plan I I thought it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
it was a pretty good plan I I thought it
was<00:01:05.430> good<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.290> least

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
was good like it would take at least

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.570 
was good like it would take at least
four<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.740> five<00:01:07.860> turns<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.310> him<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> get

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
four or five turns for him to get

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.810 
four or five turns for him to get
through<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.909> net<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.960> this
