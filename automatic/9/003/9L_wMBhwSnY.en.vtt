sheep guides about the boots that
they've<00:00:32.720> been<00:00:32.870> using<00:00:33.080> what<00:00:33.410> they've<00:00:33.559> liked

it<00:00:44.330> into<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.629> boot<00:00:44.899> specifically<00:00:45.620> made<00:00:45.860> for

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
it into a boot specifically made for

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.990 
it into a boot specifically made for
hunters<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:48.590> is<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:49.489> is<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.820> first

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
hunters and this is this is the first

hunters and this is this is the first
effort<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.629> first<00:00:51.170> model<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.890> prototype<00:00:52.879> that

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
effort a first model and prototype that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.270 
effort a first model and prototype that
I've<00:00:53.390> been<00:00:53.480> testing<00:00:53.899> up<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.110> Alaska<00:00:54.620> this

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
I've been testing up in Alaska this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.130 
I've been testing up in Alaska this
boots<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.879> bit<00:00:56.300> unique<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:56.809> want<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.020> take

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
boots a bit unique and I want to take

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.840 
boots a bit unique and I want to take
you<00:00:57.260> through<00:00:57.500> some<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.010> some<00:00:58.699> of<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
you through some of the some of the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.010 
you through some of the some of the
features<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.149> I<00:00:59.360> really<00:00:59.570> like<00:00:59.719> about<00:00:59.840> this

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
features that I really like about this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.869 
features that I really like about this
but<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.500> does<00:01:00.680> come<00:01:00.860> with<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.039> full<00:01:01.190> shank<00:01:01.489> so

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
but it does come with a full shank so

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.790 
but it does come with a full shank so
it's<00:01:02.030> going<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.210> give<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:02.510> nice<00:01:02.809> stiff<00:01:03.440> sole

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
it's going to give you a nice stiff sole

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.060 
it's going to give you a nice stiff sole
which<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.789> really<00:01:05.300> an<00:01:05.660> advantage<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.649> steep

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
which is really an advantage in steep

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.719 
which is really an advantage in steep
technical<00:01:07.640> terrain<00:01:08.770> especially<00:01:09.770> under<00:01:10.340> heavy

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
technical terrain especially under heavy

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.730 
technical terrain especially under heavy
loads<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:11.720> if<00:01:11.930> your<00:01:12.080> if<00:01:12.259> your<00:01:12.410> backpack

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
loads you know if your if your backpack

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.430 
loads you know if your if your backpack
hunting<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:14.180> does<00:01:14.390> have<00:01:14.539> a<00:01:14.600> nice<00:01:14.810> full<00:01:15.140> rand

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440

hunting it does have a nice full rand
with<00:01:15.710> great<00:01:15.979> coverage<00:01:16.220> comes<00:01:16.910> really<00:01:17.090> high<00:01:17.270> on

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
with great coverage comes really high on

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.940 
with great coverage comes really high on
the<00:01:17.509> heel<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.959> then<00:01:18.349> one<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.679> unique

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
the heel and then one of the unique

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.919 
the heel and then one of the unique
things<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:19.369> about<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.670> ram<00:01:19.849> is<00:01:20.119> how<00:01:20.780> it

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
things I like about the ram is how it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.999 
things I like about the ram is how it
comes<00:01:21.110> up<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.709> over<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.789> toe<00:01:24.009> Marko's

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
comes up and over the toe Marko's

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.010 
comes up and over the toe Marko's
amberlynn<00:01:25.490> designed<00:01:26.149> some<00:01:26.420> unique<00:01:26.660> hardware

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
amberlynn designed some unique hardware

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.749 
amberlynn designed some unique hardware
for<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.319> boot<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.679> does<00:01:27.830> have<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.130> full<00:01:28.429> pulley

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
for this boot it does have a full pulley

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.059 
for this boot it does have a full pulley
system<00:01:29.330> which<00:01:29.929> allows<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.319> laces<00:01:30.679> to<00:01:30.950> get

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
system which allows the laces to get

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.800 
system which allows the laces to get
nice<00:01:31.310> tight<00:01:31.789> fit<00:01:32.090> through<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.390> bottom<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.720> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
nice tight fit through the bottom of the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.370 
nice tight fit through the bottom of the
boot<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.490> then<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.789> locking<00:01:35.690> mechanism<00:01:35.720> which

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
boot and then a locking mechanism which

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.469 
boot and then a locking mechanism which
is<00:01:36.560> unique<00:01:36.860> I've<00:01:37.009> never<00:01:37.190> seen<00:01:37.429> before<00:01:37.520> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
is unique I've never seen before that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.859 
is unique I've never seen before that
will<00:01:38.899> lock<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.349> laces<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:39.920> place<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.569> pull

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
will lock the laces in place so you pull

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.479 
will lock the laces in place so you pull
the<00:01:42.080> laces<00:01:42.259> up<00:01:42.560> through<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.009> locking

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.489 
the laces up through this locking

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.620 
the laces up through this locking
mechanism<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.550> keeps<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.759> laces<00:01:47.479> from

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
mechanism and keeps the laces from

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.809 
mechanism and keeps the laces from
backing<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:49.190> when<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.399> want<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.640> loosen

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
backing out and when you want to loosen

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.180 
backing out and when you want to loosen
you<00:01:50.209> pull<00:01:50.599> it<00:01:50.690> out<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:51.110> release<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:51.860> laces

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
you pull it out in release the laces

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.309 
you pull it out in release the laces
let's<00:01:52.700> let<00:01:52.849> you<00:01:53.000> get<00:01:53.149> again<00:01:53.479> nice<00:01:53.750> tight<00:01:54.050> fit
