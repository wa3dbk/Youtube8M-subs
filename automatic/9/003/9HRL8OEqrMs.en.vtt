stainless steel grill itself there's a
new<00:02:37.430> product<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:37.910> we've<00:02:38.060> been<00:02:38.180> working<00:02:38.360> with

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
new product that we've been working with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.660 
new product that we've been working with
called<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.990> grill<00:02:39.260> grate<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.680> what<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.400> is

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
called the grill grate and what it is is

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.700 
called the grill grate and what it is is
an<00:02:40.790> oxidized<00:02:41.330> aluminum<00:02:41.570> grilling<00:02:42.500> surface

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
an oxidized aluminum grilling surface

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.660 
an oxidized aluminum grilling surface
that<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:44.350> creating<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.710> best<00:02:45.740> grilling

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
that is creating the best grilling

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.950 
that is creating the best grilling
experience<00:02:46.910> imaginable<00:02:47.660> watch<00:02:48.530> how<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:48.830> works

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
experience imaginable watch how it works

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.590 
experience imaginable watch how it works
so<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.110> thing<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.320> now<00:02:51.620> past<00:02:52.580> 700<00:02:53.270> degrees

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
so this thing is now past 700 degrees

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.460 
so this thing is now past 700 degrees
we're<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.500> open<00:02:54.770> slowly<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:57.080> got<00:02:57.200> full

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
flame in there and here we go we're

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.590 
flame in there and here we go we're
going<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.750> start<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.050> sear<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.290> steak<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.450> it's

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
going to start to sear a steak so it's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.090 
going to start to sear a steak so it's
nice<00:03:02.780> about<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.140> grill<00:03:03.350> grates<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.710> few<00:03:03.920> things

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
nice about the grill grates a few things

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.860 
nice about the grill grates a few things
number<00:03:04.340> one<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.820> prevents<00:03:05.210> flare-ups<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
number one it prevents flare-ups and a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.110 
number one it prevents flare-ups and a
rib<00:03:06.050> eye<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.200> quite<00:03:06.560> fatty<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.610> none<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
rib eye is quite fatty so none of the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.790 
rib eye is quite fatty so none of the
drips<00:03:08.450> are<00:03:08.600> going<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.780> create<00:03:08.990> huge<00:03:09.320> flare-ups

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
drips are going to create huge flare-ups

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.620 
drips are going to create huge flare-ups
which<00:03:09.950> could<00:03:10.160> burn<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.550> meat<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.330> other<00:03:11.450> nice

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
which could burn the meat the other nice

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.150 
which could burn the meat the other nice
thing<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:11.990> it<00:03:12.110> gives<00:03:12.290> air<00:03:12.500> space<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:13.040> between

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
thing is it gives air space in between

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.250 
thing is it gives air space in between
so<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:13.790> getting<00:03:13.880> circulating<00:03:14.720> convection

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
so you're getting circulating convection

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260 
so you're getting circulating convection
air<00:03:15.440> in<00:03:15.590> between<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.790> happens<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.150> be

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
air in between and it happens to be

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.090 
air in between and it happens to be
nonstick<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.380> really<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.680> trifecta

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
nonstick so it's really the trifecta

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.780 
nonstick so it's really the trifecta
here<00:03:19.520> comes<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.030> flip<00:03:21.370> look<00:03:22.370> at<00:03:22.460> those<00:03:22.580> grill

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
here comes a flip look at those grill

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.900 
here comes a flip look at those grill
marks<00:03:23.260> absolutely<00:03:24.260> perfection<00:03:24.710> that's<00:03:25.580> like

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
marks absolutely perfection that's like

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.130 
marks absolutely perfection that's like
a<00:03:26.000> solid<00:03:26.450> nice<00:03:26.630> crust<00:03:27.190> look<00:03:28.190> at<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.550> sear<00:03:29.140> off

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
a solid nice crust look at that sear off

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.910 
a solid nice crust look at that sear off
