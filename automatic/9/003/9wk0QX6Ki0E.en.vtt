more<00:02:09.869> -<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> interesting<00:02:10.800> isn't<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
more - that is interesting isn't it the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490 
more - that is interesting isn't it the
thing<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.569> mode<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
thing is mode one

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the throttle is on distich but that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.650 
the throttle is on distich but that
straightaway<00:02:17.280> rivers<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.850> what<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.450> done

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
straightaway rivers to what we have done

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.410 
straightaway rivers to what we have done
and<00:02:18.990> more<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.310> throttle<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.940> distich

and more to the throttle is on distich

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.530 
and more to the throttle is on distich
that's<00:02:22.290> would<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.620> always<00:02:23.040> -<00:02:23.460> yeah<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.180> I'll

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
that's would be always - yeah so I'll

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.290 
that's would be always - yeah so I'll
show<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.840> how<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.430> put<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.060> more

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
show you how to put it on what one more

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.540 
show you how to put it on what one more
-<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.960> thing<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.920> press

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
- the thing is that you have to press

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.660 
- the thing is that you have to press
the<00:02:30.210> right<00:02:30.360> stick<00:02:30.750> inside<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.830> then<00:02:32.370> switch

the right stick inside and then switch

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180 
the right stick inside and then switch
on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.940> transmitter<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.200> way<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.800> can

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
on the transmitter in that way you can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.790 
on the transmitter in that way you can
switch<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.850> mode<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.690> -<00:02:36.930> okay

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
switch it on to mode one or more - okay

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
switch it on to mode one or more - okay

switch it on always turn on the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.910 
switch it on always turn on the
transmitter<00:03:06.780> first<00:03:07.350> before<00:03:07.770> you're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
transmitter first before you're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.430 
transmitter first before you're
connecting<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.790> plane<00:03:09.660> switching<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.350> the

connecting the plane switching on the
plane<00:03:10.650> because<00:03:10.860> if<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:11.970> another

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
plane because if there's another

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.670 
plane because if there's another
transmitter<00:03:12.840> working<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> same

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
transmitter working on the same

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.160 
transmitter working on the same
frequency<00:03:14.459> then<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.690> might<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:15.990> an

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
frequency then there might be an

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.960 
frequency then there might be an
interference<00:03:16.410> problem<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.310> your<00:03:17.430> plane<00:03:17.700> can

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
interference problem and your plane can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
interference problem and your plane can
go<00:03:18.140> align<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.410> transmitter<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
go align with that transmitter and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.030 
go align with that transmitter and
sometimes<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> may<00:03:21.209> even<00:03:21.630> lead<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:22.050> crash<00:03:22.350> so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
sometimes it may even lead to a crash so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370 
sometimes it may even lead to a crash so
always<00:03:23.550> turn<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> transmitter<00:03:24.630> fuss<00:03:25.110> it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
always turn on the transmitter fuss it's

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.290 
always turn on the transmitter fuss it's
very<00:03:25.560> easy<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.890> remember<00:03:26.160> turn<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.150> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
very easy to remember turn on the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.449 
very easy to remember turn on the
transmitter<00:03:27.510> first<00:03:28.080> turn<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> plane

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
transmitter first turn on the plane

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.860 
transmitter first turn on the plane
second<00:03:29.940> turn<00:03:30.600> off<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.440> plane<00:03:31.850> first<00:03:32.850> turn<00:03:33.630> off

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
second turn off the plane first turn off

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.830 
second turn off the plane first turn off
the<00:03:34.380> transmitter<00:03:34.650> last<00:03:35.300> okay<00:03:36.300> now<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:36.510> have

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the transmitter last okay now we have

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
the transmitter last okay now we have
similarly<00:03:37.320> displays<00:03:37.800> your<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.280> six<00:03:38.519> point

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
similarly displays your that six point

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.340 
similarly displays your that six point
zero<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.300> voltage<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.900> transmitter

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
zero is the voltage of the transmitter

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.080 
zero is the voltage of the transmitter
then<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.340> would<00:03:41.459> send<00:03:41.610> more<00:03:41.850> -<00:03:42.530> okay<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.280> now

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
then I would send more - okay so now

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:55.860 
then I would send more - okay so now
let's<00:03:45.330> go<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.600> plug<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.230> clinic

we cannot fly it and wilt because this

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.370 
we cannot fly it and wilt because this
is<00:04:23.889> almost<00:04:24.889> 30<00:04:25.699> grams<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.389> might<00:04:26.930> blow<00:04:27.229> away

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
is almost 30 grams and might blow away

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.050 
is almost 30 grams and might blow away
with<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.830> wind<00:04:28.039> hey<00:04:28.910> show<00:04:29.090> me<00:04:29.650> then<00:04:30.680> yeah<00:04:31.280> the
