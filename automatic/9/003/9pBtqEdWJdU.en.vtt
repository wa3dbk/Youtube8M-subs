by making bigger and better buildings

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.579 
by making bigger and better buildings
okay<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.570> each<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> us<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:02.070> our<00:01:02.250> house<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
okay so each one of us has our house and

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
okay so each one of us has our house and
in<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.860> we'll<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.189> collecting<00:01:05.850> these

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
in here we'll be collecting these

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.020 
in here we'll be collecting these
neighborhood<00:01:07.290> tiles<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.520> stack<00:01:08.850> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
neighborhood tiles which will stack in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
neighborhood tiles which will stack in
here<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.650> move<00:01:10.680> them<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.159> here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
here and then as we move them into here

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
here and then as we move them into here
there<00:01:11.670> they're<00:01:12.030> usable<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> actually

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
there they're usable so we can actually

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.429 
there they're usable so we can actually
build<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.220> into<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.060> city<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.020> you'll

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
build them out into the city so you'll

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
build them out into the city so you'll
see<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.460> hexagons

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
see that these are kind of like hexagons

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390 
see that these are kind of like hexagons
what<00:01:18.600> we're<00:01:18.780> trying<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.530> build<00:01:20.009> into

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
what we're trying to do is build into

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
what we're trying to do is build into
the<00:01:20.490> hexagons<00:01:20.970> various<00:01:21.890> types<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> these

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the hexagons various types of these

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
the hexagons various types of these
neighborhoods<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.960> complete<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
neighborhoods and when we complete a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.679 
neighborhoods and when we complete a
hexagon<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> ability<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
hexagon we will have the ability to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
hexagon we will have the ability to
place<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> building<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.950> central

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
place a building there a central

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.670 
place a building there a central
building<00:01:29.759> okay<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.560> have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
building okay right so I don't have

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
building okay right so I don't have
these<00:01:31.799> punched<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.460> yet<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
these punched at all yet but there are

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.319 
these punched at all yet but there are
temples<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.950> amphitheaters<00:01:35.790> there

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
temples there are amphitheaters there

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.620 
temples there are amphitheaters there
are

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.780 

fountains<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.630> some<00:01:41.630> Colosseum's<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:43.550> that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
fountains and some Colosseum's like that

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.820 
fountains and some Colosseum's like that
so<00:01:44.120> we<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> variety<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.960> buildings<00:01:45.140> okay

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
so we have a variety of buildings okay

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.150 
so we have a variety of buildings okay
and<00:01:46.700> each<00:01:47.210> one<00:01:47.480> is<00:01:47.630> worth<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:48.050> points<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:48.920> you

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
and each one is worth more points if you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.330 
and each one is worth more points if you
know<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.400> bigger<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.310> when<00:01:52.310> I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
know the bigger that it is so when I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.280 
know the bigger that it is so when I
play<00:01:52.670> from<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.480> will<00:01:53.720> bring<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
play from here I will bring a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.050 
play from here I will bring a
neighborhood<00:01:54.950> child<00:01:55.220> out<00:01:55.460> I'll<00:01:55.670> place<00:01:55.910> it

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
neighborhood child out I'll place it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.590 
neighborhood child out I'll place it

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
two actions so I can actually add

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.880 
two actions so I can actually add
actions<00:03:26.150> by<00:03:26.450> spending<00:03:26.780> Imperium<00:03:27.410> I'm<00:03:27.740> like

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
actions by spending Imperium I'm like

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.560 
actions by spending Imperium I'm like
I'm<00:03:28.010> important<00:03:28.550> get<00:03:28.670> out<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:28.910> way<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.270> have

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
I'm important get out of the way I have

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.330 
I'm important get out of the way I have
more<00:03:29.720> things<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.080> do<00:03:30.200> all<00:03:30.950> right

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
more things to do all right

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.130 
more things to do all right
so<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.310> very<00:03:34.520> simplistic<00:03:35.030> game<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.660> yet

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
so it's a very simplistic game and yet

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.590 
so it's a very simplistic game and yet
very<00:03:36.380> deep<00:03:37.130> strategy<00:03:37.430> because<00:03:38.090> you're

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
very deep strategy because you're

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.560 
very deep strategy because you're
playing<00:03:39.280> with<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.610> other<00:03:40.730> people<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.240> try<00:03:41.300> to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
playing with the other people to try to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300 
playing with the other people to try to
get<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.200> different<00:03:42.500> buildings<00:03:42.830> built

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
get the different buildings built

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.190 
get the different buildings built
you<00:03:43.580> obviously<00:03:44.000> want<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.270> most<00:03:44.450> buildings<00:03:44.810> if

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
you obviously want the most buildings if

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.340 
you obviously want the most buildings if
there's<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.470> clash<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.670> don't<00:03:46.970> agree<00:03:47.350> maybe

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
there's a clash and we don't agree maybe

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.380 
there's a clash and we don't agree maybe
you<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.710> three<00:03:48.950> red<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.490> had<00:03:49.700> three<00:03:49.970> green

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
you have three red and I had three green

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.080 
you have three red and I had three green
all<00:03:51.110> right<00:03:51.230> well<00:03:51.950> we're<00:03:52.490> gonna<00:03:52.610> basically<00:03:52.850> be

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
all right well we're gonna basically be

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.420 
all right well we're gonna basically be
equal<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.750> know<00:03:53.930> if<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.710> had<00:03:54.860> three<00:03:55.100> red<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.400> I

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
equal I know if you had three red and I

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.370 
equal I know if you had three red and I
had<00:03:55.610> three<00:03:55.790> red<00:03:55.970> we're<00:03:56.360> gonna<00:03:56.450> be<00:03:56.630> equal<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.140> we

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
had three red we're gonna be equal so we

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.840 
had three red we're gonna be equal so we
can't<00:03:57.680> build<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.190> we<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.550> decide

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
can't build that in it we have to decide

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.030 
can't build that in it we have to decide
to<00:03:59.000> build<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.210> fountain<00:03:59.570> there<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.260> whoever

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
to build a fountain there so whoever

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.890 
to build a fountain there so whoever
builds<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.430> fountain<00:04:01.790> gets<00:04:02.090> only<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.570> coin

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
builds the fountain gets only a coin

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.480 
builds the fountain gets only a coin
it's<00:04:03.200> coins<00:04:03.500> are<00:04:03.740> worth<00:04:03.770> points<00:04:04.220> at<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.400> end

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
it's coins are worth points at the end

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.070 
it's coins are worth points at the end
of<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.640> game<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.540> not<00:04:05.630> what<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.930> really

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
of the game but it's not what you really

not what you really want you want the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.440 
not what you really want you want the
big<00:04:07.970> building<00:04:08.330> you<00:04:08.450> want<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.780> edifice<00:04:10.450> so

big building you want the edifice so

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.730 
big building you want the edifice so
that's<00:04:11.600> pretty<00:04:11.840> pretty<00:04:12.110> much<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.440> game<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.680> a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
that's pretty pretty much the game in a

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.280 
that's pretty pretty much the game in a
nutshell<00:04:12.830> not<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:13.760> there<00:04:14.300> are<00:04:14.480> aqueducts<00:04:15.080> in

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
nutshell not it's there are aqueducts in

nutshell not it's there are aqueducts in
the<00:04:15.380> game<00:04:15.580> aqueducts<00:04:16.580> can<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:16.940> built<00:04:17.180> outward

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.010 
the game they're actually laying them
out<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> they<00:04:29.090> says<00:04:29.360> they<00:04:29.600> connect<00:04:29.900> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
out so they says they connect the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.180 
out so they says they connect the
fountains<00:04:30.440> you're<00:04:30.560> gonna<00:04:30.680> get<00:04:30.830> more<00:04:31.010> points
