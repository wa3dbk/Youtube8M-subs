boss came and took over because we're
almost<00:03:15.890> near<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.340> end<00:03:16.670> when<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:18.020> to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
almost near the end when it's going to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:28.339 
almost near the end when it's going to
let<00:03:18.230> go<00:03:18.410> from<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.740> sides<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.220> pot<00:03:21.940> show<00:03:22.940> me

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.160 

so<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.129> trick<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.430> fudge<00:03:29.969> is<00:03:30.329> knowing<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
so the trick with fudge is knowing the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.289 
so the trick with fudge is knowing the
right<00:03:31.439> time<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:32.819> get<00:03:32.999> it<00:03:33.120> off<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.420> stove

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
right time to get it off on the stove

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.190 
right time to get it off on the stove
see<00:03:36.299> how<00:03:36.420> it's<00:03:36.569> letting<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:36.870> from<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.230> pot<00:03:39.200> so

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
see how it's letting go from the pot so

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020 
see how it's letting go from the pot so
I<00:03:40.260> guess<00:03:40.439> we<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.769> few<00:03:41.069> more<00:03:41.159> minutes<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.549> go

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
I guess we have a few more minutes to go

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.300 
I guess we have a few more minutes to go
and<00:03:42.780> we're<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.079> get<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> greased

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
you saw that the trick was that we have

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.110 
you saw that the trick was that we have
to<00:04:51.950> get<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.250> out<00:04:52.400> pretty<00:04:52.669> quickly<00:04:52.880> while<00:04:53.000> it

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
to get that out pretty quickly while it

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.030 
to get that out pretty quickly while it
was<00:04:53.270> hot<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.750> spread<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.260> as<00:04:54.380> thin<00:04:54.620> as<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:54.770> need

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
was hot and spread it as thin as we need

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040 
was hot and spread it as thin as we need
for<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.400> go<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:56.180> then<00:04:56.450> when<00:04:56.600> it's<00:04:56.750> cooled

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
for it to go and then when it's cooled

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.350 
for it to go and then when it's cooled
down<00:04:57.230> we're<00:04:57.560> gonna<00:04:57.710> cut<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.400> into<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.180> different

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
down we're gonna cut it into a different

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.260 
down we're gonna cut it into a different
size<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.870> any<00:05:00.020> way<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:00.230> do<00:05:00.350> brownie<00:05:01.270> we're

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
size of any way you do brownie we're

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.680 
size of any way you do brownie we're
gonna<00:05:02.419> mark<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.900> first<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.470> then<00:05:03.980> cut<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.690> so

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
gonna mark it first and then cut it so

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.500 
gonna mark it first and then cut it so
let's<00:05:06.500> give<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.770> few<00:05:06.800> minutes<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.310> cool<00:05:07.460> down

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.400 

Perle<00:05:10.720> marking<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.950> fudge

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.170 

into<00:05:17.160> serving<00:05:17.670> serving<00:05:18.600> sizes<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.940> you<00:05:21.150> can

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
into serving serving sizes and you can

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.970 
into serving serving sizes and you can
make<00:05:21.450> it<00:05:21.570> as<00:05:21.660> big<00:05:21.840> as<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.110> want<00:05:22.350> or<00:05:22.650> as<00:05:22.680> small
