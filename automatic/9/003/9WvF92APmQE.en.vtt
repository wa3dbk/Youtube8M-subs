00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
this is very well balanced now I've

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.319 
this is very well balanced now I've
checked<00:04:10.590> out<00:04:10.769> tried<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.099> mine<00:04:11.400> some<00:04:11.729> and<00:04:12.030> that

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
checked out tried to mine some and that

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.149 
checked out tried to mine some and that
it's<00:04:12.629> fair<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.199> very<00:04:13.470> well<00:04:13.709> bounced<00:04:13.949> i

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
it's fair it's very well bounced i

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.089 
it's fair it's very well bounced i
assure<00:04:14.609> you<00:04:14.639> of<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.389> so<00:04:16.349> it's<00:04:16.799> not

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
assure you of that and so it's not

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.009 
assure you of that and so it's not
overpowered<00:04:17.699> it's<00:04:17.909> very<00:04:18.150> nicely<00:04:18.419> done<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
overpowered it's very nicely done and

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.990 
overpowered it's very nicely done and
the<00:04:19.500> one<00:04:19.680> thing<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.949> I'd<00:04:20.159> like<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.549> see<00:04:20.789> it's

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the one thing that I'd like to see it's

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
the one thing that I'd like to see it's
maybe<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.269> little<00:04:21.359> bit<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.720> more<00:04:21.930> armor<00:04:22.409> costume

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
maybe a little bit of more armor costume

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.129 
maybe a little bit of more armor costume
because<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.460> gun<00:04:23.669> variation<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.450> very<00:04:24.900> like

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
because the gun variation is very like

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.050 
because the gun variation is very like
