reason they're lying fallow so the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
reason they're lying fallow so the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
places secure leases on them and then

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
places secure leases on them and then
start<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> fence<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.680> they're<00:01:22.890> protected

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
start to fence them so they're protected

no one to speak up for us in the right
places<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.920> carp<00:04:58.160> society<00:04:58.580> was<00:04:58.730> set<00:04:58.880> up<00:04:58.910> many

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
places the carp society was set up many

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.660 
places the carp society was set up many
years<00:04:59.480> ago<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.810> do<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.440> that's<00:05:01.040> pretty<00:05:01.430> much

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
years ago to do that that's pretty much

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.460 
years ago to do that that's pretty much
fizzled<00:05:02.240> away<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.840> has<00:05:02.990> basically<00:05:03.380> just

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
fizzled away and has basically just

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.310 
fizzled away and has basically just
become<00:05:03.950> an<00:05:04.070> angling<00:05:04.460> Club<00:05:04.730> now<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.660> paj<00:05:05.990> are

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
become an angling Club now the paj are

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.080 
become an angling Club now the paj are

basically<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.650> get<00:05:15.800> our<00:05:15.980> argument<00:05:16.520> heard<00:05:16.760> and

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
basically to get our argument heard and

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.480 
basically to get our argument heard and
to<00:05:17.630> give<00:05:17.840> us<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.200> voice<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:18.650> that's<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.980> long<00:05:19.250> way

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
to give us a voice but that's a long way

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.820 
to give us a voice but that's a long way
down<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.910> line<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.720> begin<00:05:20.990> with<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.410> think<00:05:21.680> the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
down the line to begin with I think the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.920 
down the line to begin with I think the
thing<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.160> can<00:05:22.340> do<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.640> best<00:05:22.670> is<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.390> create

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
thing I can do the best is to create

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.230 
thing I can do the best is to create
more<00:05:23.960> fisheries<00:05:24.710> secure<00:05:25.490> more<00:05:25.730> fisheries

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
more fisheries secure more fisheries

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.520 
more fisheries secure more fisheries
that's<00:05:26.480> going<00:05:26.630> to<00:05:26.690> make<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:26.990> most<00:05:27.260> difference

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
that's going to make the most difference

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.190 
that's going to make the most difference
to<00:05:27.830> carp<00:05:28.040> angling<00:05:28.490> in<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.910> short<00:05:29.180> term<00:05:29.420> if<00:05:29.690> we

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
to carp angling in the short term if we

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.810 
to carp angling in the short term if we
just<00:05:30.410> wait<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.800> fight<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.160> argument<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:31.730> it

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
just wait to fight the argument and it

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.910 
just wait to fight the argument and it
takes<00:05:32.060> ten<00:05:32.300> or<00:05:32.420> fifteen<00:05:32.810> years<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:33.620> get<00:05:33.770> into

them how to feed them so there's a

strains all around the country they're

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.480 
strains all around the country they're
being<00:06:06.080> brought<00:06:06.410> on<00:06:06.620> because<00:06:07.040> there's<00:06:07.370> a

being brought on because there's a

massive resource there that isn't being

massive resource there that isn't being
taken<00:06:10.340> advantage<00:06:10.820> of<00:06:10.940> these<00:06:11.150> fish<00:06:11.390> is

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
taken advantage of these fish is

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.930 
taken advantage of these fish is
spawning<00:06:11.780> every<00:06:12.200> year<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:13.040> most<00:06:13.160> mortality

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
spawning every year the most mortality

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.270 
spawning every year the most mortality
rate<00:06:14.150> is<00:06:14.360> 99<00:06:15.169> percent<00:06:15.200> or<00:06:15.770> higher<00:06:15.950> in<00:06:16.250> most

lakes so hardly anything gets through if

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.620 
lakes so hardly anything gets through if
we<00:06:18.830> show<00:06:19.250> people<00:06:19.550> how<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.090> dig<00:06:20.419> their<00:06:20.600> own

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
we show people how to dig their own

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.690 
we show people how to dig their own
little<00:06:21.050> pits<00:06:21.350> there<00:06:22.070> are<00:06:22.190> little<00:06:22.400> stocked

they can start bringing fish on
