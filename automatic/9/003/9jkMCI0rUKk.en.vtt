hey guys and welcome back to the fourth
video<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:28.910> this<00:00:29.210> series<00:00:29.989> in<00:00:30.640> this<00:00:31.640> case<00:00:31.820> we

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
video of this series in this case we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.170 
video of this series in this case we
have<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.300> adopt<00:00:32.659> premier<00:00:33.019> rendering<00:00:33.379> times

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
have the adopt premier rendering times

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410 
have the adopt premier rendering times
on<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.540> Mac<00:00:35.750> Mini<00:00:36.760> comparison<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.940> see<00:00:38.149> how

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
on the Mac Mini comparison to see how

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.200 
on the Mac Mini comparison to see how
good<00:00:38.860> this<00:00:39.860> machine<00:00:40.280> goes<00:00:40.519> on<00:00:40.850> this

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
good this machine goes on this

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.889 
good this machine goes on this
particular<00:00:41.839> software<00:00:42.769> so<00:00:43.760> in<00:00:44.390> here<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:44.870> are

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
particular software so in here we are

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.460 
particular software so in here we are
using<00:00:45.229> a<00:00:45.649> ten<00:00:46.159> minutes<00:00:46.489> footage<00:00:47.470> h.264

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
using a ten minutes footage h.264

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.119 
using a ten minutes footage h.264
rendering<00:00:49.460> with<00:00:49.790> no<00:00:50.089> effects<00:00:50.509> at<00:00:50.570> all<00:00:50.659> so<00:00:51.290> if

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
rendering with no effects at all so if

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.119 
rendering with no effects at all so if
you<00:00:52.939> are<00:00:53.089> planning<00:00:53.540> on<00:00:53.809> using<00:00:54.650> your<00:00:54.949> machine

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
you are planning on using your machine

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.329 
you are planning on using your machine
and<00:00:55.580> if<00:00:56.299> you<00:00:56.479> are<00:00:56.600> planning<00:00:56.839> not<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.409> to<00:00:58.129> use

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
and if you are planning not to to use

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.749 
and if you are planning not to to use
effects<00:00:59.470> here's<00:01:00.470> an<00:01:00.650> idea<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.369> timings

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:01.759 
effects here's an idea of the timings

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.819 
effects here's an idea of the timings
that<00:01:01.790> you<00:01:02.030> can<00:01:02.210> get<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.689> let's<00:01:03.379> take<00:01:03.619> a<00:01:03.650> look

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
that you can get and let's take a look

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.490 
that you can get and let's take a look
at<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.100> graphic<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.630> Mac<00:01:05.780> Mini<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:06.200> render

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
at a graphic so the Mac Mini to render

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.880 
at a graphic so the Mac Mini to render
out<00:01:06.650> these<00:01:07.460> ten<00:01:07.759> minutes<00:01:08.060> took<00:01:08.530> 14<00:01:09.530> minutes

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
out these ten minutes took 14 minutes

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.569 
out these ten minutes took 14 minutes
and<00:01:10.130> 6<00:01:10.610> seconds<00:01:11.470> as<00:01:12.470> we<00:01:12.829> can<00:01:12.979> see<00:01:13.189> in<00:01:13.369> the

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
and 6 seconds as we can see in the

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.859 
and 6 seconds as we can see in the
screenshot<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.390> output<00:01:14.930> here<00:01:16.360> took<00:01:17.360> 14

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
screenshot that output here took 14

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.170 
screenshot that output here took 14
minutes<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.590> render<00:01:18.829> 10<00:01:19.159> minutes<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.640> not<00:01:19.880> a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
minutes to render 10 minutes is not a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.230 
minutes to render 10 minutes is not a
great<00:01:20.600> time<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.070> capable<00:01:22.550> and<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:23.000> can

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
great time but is capable and you can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.520 
great time but is capable and you can
have<00:01:23.690> managed<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.140> work<00:01:24.470> with<00:01:24.940> as<00:01:25.940> long<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
have managed to work with as long the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.000 
have managed to work with as long the
MacBook<00:01:27.979> Pro<00:01:28.250> took<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:30.290> if<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.710> haven't

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
MacBook Pro took and if you haven't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.070 
MacBook Pro took and if you haven't
watched<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.460> specs<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.210> MacBook<00:01:32.540> Pro<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
watched the specs of the MacBook Pro and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.770 
watched the specs of the MacBook Pro and
which<00:01:33.740> might<00:01:33.950> project<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.060> earlier<00:01:35.360> videos

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
which might project the earlier videos

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.630 
which might project the earlier videos
where<00:01:36.440> I'll<00:01:36.560> talk<00:01:36.710> about<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.340> machines

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
where I'll talk about all the machines

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.719 
where I'll talk about all the machines
that<00:01:37.729> I'm<00:01:38.360> testing<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:40.190> MacBook<00:01:40.520> Pro

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that I'm testing out the MacBook Pro

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.490 
that I'm testing out the MacBook Pro
took<00:01:41.060> 11<00:01:41.900> minutes<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.470> one<00:01:43.630> second<00:01:44.690> my<00:01:45.200> main

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
took 11 minutes and one second my main

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.250 
took 11 minutes and one second my main
workstation<00:01:46.220> took<00:01:46.460> 7<00:01:47.150> minutes<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.659> 18

workstation took 7 minutes and 18

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.969 
workstation took 7 minutes and 18
seconds<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.830> half<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.820> time<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.740> Mac

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
seconds so half of the time of the Mac

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.170 
seconds so half of the time of the Mac
Mini<00:01:52.600> regarding<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:54.790> software<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.880> dog

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
Mini regarding this software a dog

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.890 
Mini regarding this software a dog
premiere<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.760> well<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.939> be<00:01:59.030> honest<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.510> can

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
premiere and well to be honest you can

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.080 
premiere and well to be honest you can
work<00:02:00.200> with<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.799> will<00:02:00.920> lose<00:02:01.130> time<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.970> are

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
work with it you will lose time we are

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.940 
work with it you will lose time we are
talking<00:02:02.210> about<00:02:02.390> 10<00:02:02.720> minutes<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.500> if<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.770> are

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
talking about 10 minutes so if you are

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.580 
talking about 10 minutes so if you are
working<00:02:04.159> with<00:02:04.460> big<00:02:04.760> video<00:02:05.090> files<00:02:05.380> one<00:02:06.380> hour

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
working with big video files one hour

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.479 
working with big video files one hour
and<00:02:07.369> things<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.269> documental<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:10.250> will

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and things like that documental it will

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.839 
and things like that documental it will
take<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:11.140> multiply<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:13.400> will<00:02:13.519> see<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
take just multiply and you will see the

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.330 
take just multiply and you will see the
time<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.480> will<00:02:14.629> lose<00:02:17.049> on<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.319> other<00:02:18.470> on

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
time that you will lose on the other on

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.300 
time that you will lose on the other on
the<00:02:19.519> other<00:02:19.549> systems<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:21.620> let's<00:02:22.010> take<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the other systems so now let's take a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.250 
the other systems so now let's take a
look<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.900> top<00:02:24.529> premiere<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:26.299> we<00:02:26.810> defects

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
look at a top premiere but we defects

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.200 
look at a top premiere but we defects
and<00:02:27.529> these<00:02:27.709> effects<00:02:28.099> are

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
and these effects are

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.630 
and these effects are
just<00:02:30.210> for<00:02:30.720> example<00:02:31.080> proposes<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:34.640> for

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
just for example proposes but for

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 
just for example proposes but for
instance<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.090> curves<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.660> always<00:02:36.990> use<00:02:37.200> curves

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
instance the curves I always use curves

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.150 
instance the curves I always use curves
and<00:02:38.270> fast<00:02:39.270> color<00:02:39.510> correction<00:02:40.020> almost<00:02:40.860> always

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and fast color correction almost always

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.480 
and fast color correction almost always
when<00:02:41.520> necessary<00:02:42.140> sharpen<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.040> much<00:02:44.220> but

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
when necessary sharpen not so much but

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.120 
when necessary sharpen not so much but
but<00:02:44.730> still<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.210> these<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.710> ones<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
but still and these are the ones that I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.580 
but still and these are the ones that I
use<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.640> benchmarking<00:02:48.510> which<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:49.170> pushes

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
use for benchmarking which really pushes

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.760 
use for benchmarking which really pushes
the<00:02:49.620> GPU<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.450> course<00:02:51.660> Mac<00:02:52.050> Mini<00:02:52.350> doesn't
