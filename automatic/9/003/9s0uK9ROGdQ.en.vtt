00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
 I have to wear a sheath after surgery 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.430
 the use of a protection 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 in the form of a glue particularly 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.499
 a strong 140 deniers 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.400
 each sheath made to measure 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.789
 and extremely useful 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.610
 I consider it indispensable in the first few days 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 ie the first week the first 15 days 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.960
 because clearly to make this fabric that I somehow unstuck 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.540
 remains 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.110
 warning sends back compressed and therefore the cicatrization is formed and not yes 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.440
 they form empty spaces that could be instead of invitations from secretions 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.230
 with production of so-called sirones 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.650
 or the very first phase of the loved ones 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 the how much to bring this sheath well depends 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 from the treated areas 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 if they were important as an extension oh - treasury salaries a 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.180
 abdomen compresses for more time than for example the knees 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 normally I recommend patients keep it up even a month 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.380
 some pro after 15 days to get rid of with the ancient of the sheath 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.340
 this is very relative 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.980
 it is clear, however, that there are patients who benefit from this 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.930
 look. for the abdomen maybe for more than a month 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.530
 it will also depend on whether it was winter 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.180
 because clearly a glue a sheath is quite little breathable 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 however the indication of this type of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.850
 Post-operative supervision is given very carefully by the brun staff 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.860
 I am fortunate to have one of my extremely attentive collaborators and 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.290
 that I follow patients in the post-operative phase, advising not only with 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 performing certain treatments against sounds with endermologie massages 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 but also in giving specific advice if in certain cases the patient 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.470
 evening poggiali never born - 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.880
 obviously everything comes from 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 photo of direct control 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.470
 why 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.120
 post surgery is certainly not as important as little melinda popper at 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.879
 however extremely 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.749
 tiring for the patient if left to herself
