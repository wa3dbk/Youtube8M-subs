00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi this is Steve just shown this joke

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:18.800 
hi this is Steve just shown this joke
has<00:00:14.630> got<00:00:15.630> beautiful<00:00:16.109> flame<00:00:16.590> back<00:00:17.600> it's<00:00:18.600> kind

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
has got beautiful flame back it's kind

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.630 
has got beautiful flame back it's kind
of<00:00:18.840> hard<00:00:19.080> prior<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> seeing<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> webcam

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of hard prior to seeing it in the webcam

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.189 
of hard prior to seeing it in the webcam
here<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.830> pretty<00:00:23.130> back<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
here but it's really a pretty back I

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.630 
here but it's really a pretty back I
guess<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> hard<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> capture<00:00:26.279> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
guess that's kind of hard to capture it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.730 
guess that's kind of hard to capture it
with<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.019> look<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> photos

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
with this but you can look at the photos

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.820 
with this but you can look at the photos
on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.460> actual<00:00:29.699> ad<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.510> okay<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
on the actual ad and see it okay this is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
on the actual ad and see it okay this is
really<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.640> interesting<00:00:32.880> sounding

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
really really an interesting sounding

00:00:33.420 --> 00:01:46.420 
really really an interesting sounding
guitars<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> great<00:00:34.320> resonance<00:00:34.710> to

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.260 

then<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:47.550> probably<00:01:47.760> getting<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:48.060> lot<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then I'm probably getting a lot of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
then I'm probably getting a lot of
distortion<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:49.080> but<00:01:49.260> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.410> could<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
distortion here but if you could use a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
distortion here but if you could use a
really<00:01:50.100> nice<00:01:50.280> jazz<00:01:50.640> box<00:01:50.970> folks<00:01:51.300> without

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
really nice jazz box folks without

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.060 
really nice jazz box folks without
spending<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> money<00:01:52.410> I<00:01:52.620> mean<00:01:52.830> my<00:01:52.920> whole

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
spending a lot of money I mean my whole

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.040 
spending a lot of money I mean my whole
life<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.520> about<00:01:53.700> chasing<00:01:54.210> great<00:01:54.420> guitar<00:01:54.780> ism

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
life is about chasing great guitar ism

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.500 
life is about chasing great guitar ism
I'm<00:01:55.740> 57<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.729> playing<00:01:56.910> guitar<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.300> long

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
I'm 57 of them playing guitar a long

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.870 
I'm 57 of them playing guitar a long
time<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.260> just<00:01:58.740> love<00:01:58.950> great<00:01:59.190> guitars<00:01:59.550> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
time and I just love great guitars and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
time and I just love great guitars and
that<00:01:59.910> like<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.840> said<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.170> ad<00:02:01.260> I<00:02:01.410> took<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
that like I said in my ad I took a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.290 
that like I said in my ad I took a
couple<00:02:01.830> lessons<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.400> Ted<00:02:02.640> green<00:02:02.910> prob<00:02:03.180> about

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
couple lessons from Ted green prob about

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.120 
couple lessons from Ted green prob about
five<00:02:03.600> years<00:02:03.810> ago<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.320> he<00:02:04.410> had<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> guitar<00:02:04.770> very

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
five years ago and he had a guitar very

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
five years ago and he had a guitar very
similar<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.350> has

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
similar to this and this one really has

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
similar to this and this one really has
a<00:02:07.710> voice<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.160> know<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.429> hard<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> capture<00:02:08.940> with

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
a voice I know it's hard to capture with

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.949 
a voice I know it's hard to capture with
the<00:02:09.630> webcam<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> certain<00:02:12.720> kind<00:02:12.900> of

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the webcam here it's a certain kind of

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.479 
the webcam here it's a certain kind of
holographic<00:02:13.500> Tom<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> sound<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.280> kind

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
holographic Tom but the sound just kind

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.640 
holographic Tom but the sound just kind
of<00:02:17.550> comes<00:02:17.790> through<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> guitar<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.080> terms<00:02:19.380> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.470 

is<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.950> rich<00:02:23.190> weighty<00:02:23.610> tome<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.300> also

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
is it a rich weighty tome but it's also

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.140 
is it a rich weighty tome but it's also
got<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.959> bloom<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.310> got<00:02:26.489> space

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
got like bloom to it and it's got space

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.210 
got like bloom to it and it's got space
around<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> notes<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> notes<00:02:28.350> are<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
around the notes like the notes are the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.180 
around the notes like the notes are the
notes<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> chords<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> defined<00:02:31.190> has

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
notes and the chords are defined has

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.790 
notes and the chords are defined has
articulation<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.150> definition<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> same

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
articulation and definition but the same

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.220 
articulation and definition but the same
time<00:02:35.070> there's<00:02:35.280> space<00:02:35.840> around<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.050> note

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
time there's space around the note

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.690 
time there's space around the note
that's<00:02:37.410> why<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> use<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.830> term<00:02:37.980> holographic

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that's why I use the term holographic

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.180 
that's why I use the term holographic
but<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.720> use<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> great<00:02:40.170> jazz<00:02:40.440> box<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:41.010> think

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
but you can use a great jazz box I think

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.289 
but you can use a great jazz box I think
you'd<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.489> happy<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.120> guitar

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
you'd be really happy with this guitar

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:58.450 
you'd be really happy with this guitar
it's<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:42.840> nice

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.640 

take<00:02:59.460> care
