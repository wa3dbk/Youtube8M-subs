00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.769
 Your smartphone is low on memory. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.960
 the type that loads the gadget with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.179
 applications music videos and photos until 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 I can no longer receive the protests here 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.170
 in tech channel this device of the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.910
 kingston o mobile o sg 2 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 it is the size of a smartphone of 5 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.300
 inches a little thicker and has 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.109
 the mission of expanding the memory of your 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.750
 telephone 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 card reader service and pen drives 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.779
 twist as a router and even 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 charge your device's battery 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 A few moments but we'll see how he 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.530
 behaves in practice in each 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 these functions so that the work is g2 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 I need to download a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 application in the apple store or in the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 google play there you have a login and password 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.079
 to protect the wifi network that will be 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 formed from the gadget 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.350
 then g2 will ask you to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 also connect an internet network 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980
 and applications will take care of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.629
 make a bridge by connecting the network 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.579
 knows that you just created the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.260
 next to the application is like a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.120
 wifi network inside the other 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 from then the application will pass 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 to show all files present 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 not only in your smartphone's memory 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 also on the cards and pen drives that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.090
 are connected to the mobile lite and there 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 you can move files from one place 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 for the other to play them erase them 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.580
 Finally you manage all the screen 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 your smartphone 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 in our tests it worked very well 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 and made our smartphones 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.330
 to earn an overnight 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 almost infinite memory since 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.869
 just change the card the pen drive to 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.869
 that other information is read 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.460
 connecting your smart tv computer or 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.350
 any device to the wifi network created 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.090
 For g2 you can access all 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.189
 files contained in the pen drive the card 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.380
 Yes , it's easy to share photos 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.240
 videos and any document for various 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.039
 local people at the same time 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.470
 in our tests the videos ran without 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.659
 gags even in full hd and on screens 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.130
 speed large TV just gets 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.479
 compromised when more than one device 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.149
 is revisiting data simultaneously 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.149
 something logical but worth mentioning here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.159
 another functionality of g2 is to act 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.659
 as a portable router 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.489
 imagine that you are in the hotel where the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.500
 weak wifi signal but there is a 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.780
 wired in the room for you to win 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.269
 only plug the network cable into the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.280
 and you can navigate to the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.110
 on your tablet or 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 desktop from the wifi network created 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.230
 by the system 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.239
 Here the problem is the scope of the sign 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.829
 g20 is made to cover large areas and 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.930
 only accepts up to eight simultaneous connections 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.930
 but it breaks the twig unexpected situations 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.150
 the mobile lite wireless g2 allows 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.980
 you transfer the battery charge 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.170
 of four thousand six hundred and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.940
 forty thousand skins on your smartphone 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.609
 so just plug the cable into the outlet 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.230
 Press the power button and the 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.139
 wait until the device wins 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 autonomy for a better understanding if the g20 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.670
 the full battery can be charged up to 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.160
 twice the iphone 5 battery or a 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.630
 your galaxy s 5 time counting 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.549
 since the appliance needs to be 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.720
 connected to charge it too. 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.720
 is consuming some of that energy 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.120
 no doubt the mobile lite wars 2 is a good one 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.560
 mainly for 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.780
 professionals who are already leaving 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.549
 desktops on a few occasions and 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.349
 trusting all the activities on the small screen 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.209
 tablet or smartphone 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.190
 people need to be connected in 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.079
 any place at any time 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.900
 producing and sharing content with 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.819
 several people in a single three gadget 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.920
 frequent problems in the lives of 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.900
 people are solved extra battery 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.420
 router for emergencies and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.290
 possibility of le pen drives and cards 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.980

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.030
 tablet 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.579
 the great villain of this story 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.079
 especially in Brazil is the price 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.030
 this toy is being sold to 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.680
 five hundred and sixty-seven reais and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.599
 twenty cents at 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.190
 kingston brazil on investment for 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.959
 any pocket thinking that it's about 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.459
 something somewhat more superfluous than 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.290
 What exactly necessary essential 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.790
 in people's lives 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.739
