finally<00:01:54.930> finish<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.520> outline<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.600> said

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
finally finish the outline like I said

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
finally finish the outline like I said
it<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.170> didn't<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.560> how<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.740> looked<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.700> just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it I didn't like how it looked so I just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
it I didn't like how it looked so I just
grabbed<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.180> little<00:02:00.390> copic<00:02:00.750> multiliner<00:02:00.930> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
grabbed my little copic multiliner I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.160 
grabbed my little copic multiliner I
think<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> point<00:02:02.490> 0<00:02:02.670> 3<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.299> wish<00:02:03.990> I'd

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
think this is the point 0 3 I wish I'd

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
think this is the point 0 3 I wish I'd
had<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> wider<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> only<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.700> I've

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
had a wider on this is the only one I've

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.059 
had a wider on this is the only one I've
got<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.229> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> went<00:02:07.590> around<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
got so I just kind of went around and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
got so I just kind of went around and
even<00:02:08.310> though<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.759> wide<00:02:09.000> enough<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.539> did

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
even though it's not wide enough it did

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170 
even though it's not wide enough it did
the<00:02:10.170> trick<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.340> really

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the trick you can see it just really

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.380 
the trick you can see it just really
helps<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.569> image<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.050> stand

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
helps the image to stand

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.840 
helps the image to stand
a little<00:02:13.780> bit<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.250> quickly<00:02:15.490> went

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
a little bit more so I just quickly went

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.570 
a little bit more so I just quickly went
over<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> lines<00:02:16.390> no<00:02:16.950> nothing<00:02:17.950> special<00:02:18.220> I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
over the lines no nothing special I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.010 
over the lines no nothing special I
didn't<00:02:18.850> go<00:02:19.060> over<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> line<00:02:19.660> completely

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
didn't go over the line completely

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.960 
didn't go over the line completely
because<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> line<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.770> thicker<00:02:21.220> than<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.640> pen

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
because the line is thicker than the pen

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.809 
because the line is thicker than the pen
i'm<00:02:22.120> using<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.770> worked<00:02:24.069> enough<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
i'm using but it just worked enough to

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.670 
i'm using but it just worked enough to
kind<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.090> fill<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.360> some<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.110> little<00:02:26.380> bits

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
kind of fill in some of the little bits

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.460 
kind of fill in some of the little bits
and<00:02:26.950> gaps<00:02:27.250> from<00:02:27.670> not<00:02:28.630> having<00:02:28.780> enough<00:02:29.110> ink<00:02:29.319> on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and gaps from not having enough ink on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.780 
and gaps from not having enough ink on
the<00:02:29.620> staff<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.040> kind<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> what<00:02:30.370> i<00:02:30.400> assume

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790

pretty sure I just need to arrange it so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.550 
pretty sure I just need to arrange it so
once<00:02:42.760> i<00:02:42.880> was<00:02:42.970> done<00:02:43.030> filling<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.780> because

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
once i was done filling that in because

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
once i was done filling that in because
it<00:02:44.800> was<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> kopeck<00:02:45.280> multiliner<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.300> still

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
it was a kopeck multiliner you can still

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.060 
it was a kopeck multiliner you can still
keep<00:02:46.810> coloring<00:02:47.080> over<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.709> i<00:02:47.770> wanted<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
keep coloring over it and i wanted to

keep coloring over it and i wanted to
add<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.640> shading<00:02:48.940> just<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.390> kind

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540

of finish him off and give him a bit of

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.340 
of finish him off and give him a bit of
depth<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.790> i<00:02:51.820> tried<00:02:52.209> w1<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:52.959> was<00:02:53.050> too<00:02:53.170> light

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
depth so i tried w1 but it was too light

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.030 
depth so i tried w1 but it was too light
so<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.500> grabbed<00:02:53.709> my<00:02:53.830> w3<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:55.590> added<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.739> little

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
so I grabbed my w3 and added that little

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.530 
so I grabbed my w3 and added that little
bit<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.280> shading<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.970> finished<00:02:58.269> him<00:02:58.420> off

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
bit of shading and just finished him off

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.740 
bit of shading and just finished him off
so<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.860> sentiment<00:03:00.310> um<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.150> monster<00:03:01.720> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
so for the sentiment um the monster is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.140 
so for the sentiment um the monster is
from<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.290> same<00:03:02.590> falling<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.430> set<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:04.120> I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150

not<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.540> same<00:04:58.780> for<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.440> just

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
not do the same for this so I just

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.290 
not do the same for this so I just
grabbed<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.340> envelope<00:05:00.730> I<00:05:00.910> was<00:05:01.060> going<00:05:01.210> to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
grabbed the envelope I was going to

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300 
grabbed the envelope I was going to
include<00:05:01.480> with<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.169> did<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.890> exact<00:05:03.220> same

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
include with this and did the exact same

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.760 
include with this and did the exact same
thing<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.210> did<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.260> inside<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
thing that I did on the inside of the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.560 
thing that I did on the inside of the
card<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.550> was<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.850> just<00:05:07.060> inked<00:05:07.300> up<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
card and that was to just inked up the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.740 
card and that was to just inked up the
stamps<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.260> same<00:05:09.010> two<00:05:09.430> memento<00:05:10.240> inks<00:05:10.570> and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
stamps in the same two memento inks and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.659 
stamps in the same two memento inks and
stamped<00:05:11.710> all<00:05:11.800> along<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.280> bottom<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.610> the

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
stamped all along the bottom of the

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.340 
stamped all along the bottom of the
cards<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.390> just<00:05:13.600> kind<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:13.930> goes<00:05:14.110> together

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
cards so it just kind of goes together

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.800 
cards so it just kind of goes together
so<00:05:14.650> it's<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.830> fun<00:05:15.040> little<00:05:15.190> matching<00:05:15.490> set<00:05:15.880> it's

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
so it's a fun little matching set it's
