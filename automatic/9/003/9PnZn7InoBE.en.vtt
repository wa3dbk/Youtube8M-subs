this is the old seat belt bolt so I made

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.270 
this is the old seat belt bolt so I made
sure<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.759> was<00:00:11.940> still<00:00:12.030> intact<00:00:13.099> but<00:00:14.099> when<00:00:14.250> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
sure it was still intact but when I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.039 
sure it was still intact but when I
released<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> come-along<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.480> thing<00:00:15.750> still

flexes<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> little<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> makes<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.580> door<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
flexes out a little and makes my door a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
flexes out a little and makes my door a
little<00:00:18.180> loose<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.529> did<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.010> drilled

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
little loose so what I did was I drilled

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.810 
little loose so what I did was I drilled
a<00:00:20.789> hole<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:22.070> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:24.859> in<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> roll<00:00:26.220> bar<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.670> was

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
a hole here in the in the roll bar I was

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
a hole here in the in the roll bar I was
thinking<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.359> welding<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.680> knob<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
thinking of welding a little knob a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429 
thinking of welding a little knob a
little<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:30.090> tab<00:00:30.330> between<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> side<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
little little tab between the side of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.950 
little little tab between the side of
the<00:00:31.500> Jeep<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> roll<00:00:32.579> bar<00:00:32.820> hold<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> sturdy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the Jeep and the roll bar hold it sturdy

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
the Jeep and the roll bar hold it sturdy
and<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.200> thought<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.590> lot<00:00:34.770> neater<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and I thought a lot neater if I put a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510 
and I thought a lot neater if I put a
little<00:00:35.790> tab<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.440> way<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.890> weld<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
little tab in that that way I can weld a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.580 
little tab in that that way I can weld a
piece<00:00:39.500> right<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> hole<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
piece right in here and with a hole in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.260 
piece right in here and with a hole in
it<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.399> put<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.640> bolt<00:00:45.000> through

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it and then I put that bolt through

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
it and then I put that bolt through
there<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.230> way<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.559> ever<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
there that way I ever want to take a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
there that way I ever want to take a
roll<00:00:47.460> bar<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.270> unbolt<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.960> slip

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
roll bar out I can unbolt that and slip

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
roll bar out I can unbolt that and slip
it<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.280> makes<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.329> sense

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it out it just makes a lot more sense

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
it out it just makes a lot more sense
and<00:00:52.079> seems<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.590> eater<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> plication<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and seems like an eater a plication so I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.160 
and seems like an eater a plication so I
went<00:00:54.870> ahead<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.510> little<00:00:57.510> threading

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
went ahead and got my little threading

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.920 
went ahead and got my little threading
dies<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.780> threaded<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
dies and threaded that out and I got it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.299 
dies and threaded that out and I got it
where<00:01:04.080> bolt<00:01:04.350> will<00:01:04.500> fit<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
where bolt will fit in there so now I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
where bolt will fit in there so now I
got<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> welding<00:01:06.030> nav<00:01:06.330> right<00:01:06.570> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
got to do the welding nav right here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.740 
got to do the welding nav right here
with<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> hole<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.640> attach<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.450> side
