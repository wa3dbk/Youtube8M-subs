much<00:04:46.160> as<00:04:46.310> if<00:04:46.510> sophisticated<00:04:47.710> philosophical

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
much as if sophisticated philosophical

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.710 
much as if sophisticated philosophical
think<00:04:48.980> were<00:04:49.370> two<00:04:49.610> things<00:04:49.820> in<00:04:50.030> these<00:04:50.150> cultural

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
think were two things in these cultural

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.379 
think were two things in these cultural
wars<00:04:51.650> between<00:04:51.919> this<00:04:52.340> side<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.940> that's<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.210> but

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
wars between this side and that's a but

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.390 
wars between this side and that's a but
much<00:04:53.870> more<00:04:54.080> as<00:04:54.230> down-to-earth<00:04:54.530> person<00:04:55.070> who

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
much more as down-to-earth person who

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.360 
much more as down-to-earth person who
loved<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.730> place<00:04:56.000> card<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:57.050> New<00:04:57.230> Year<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.740> go

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
into the mountains and and and I think

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.360 
into the mountains and and and I think
this<00:05:00.800> this<00:05:00.980> side<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:02.919> picking<00:05:03.919> this<00:05:04.100> theme

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
this this side of of picking this theme

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.510 
this this side of of picking this theme
is<00:05:04.610> twister<00:05:05.300> is<00:05:05.450> his<00:05:05.720> wish<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.680> go<00:05:06.919> into<00:05:06.950> a<00:05:07.280> more

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
is twister is his wish to go into a more

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.100 
is twister is his wish to go into a more
sophisticated<00:05:07.930> philosophical<00:05:08.930> discourse

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
sophisticated philosophical discourse

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.680 
sophisticated philosophical discourse
but<00:05:09.440> actually<00:05:09.770> that's<00:05:09.889> not<00:05:10.040> his<00:05:10.610> nature<00:05:10.910> you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
but actually that's not his nature you

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.050 
but actually that's not his nature you
know<00:05:11.780> he'd<00:05:12.320> like<00:05:12.530> he<00:05:12.770> likes<00:05:12.979> likes<00:05:13.760> he<00:05:14.270> likes

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
know he'd like he likes likes he likes

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.909 
know he'd like he likes likes he likes
religion<00:05:17.060> in<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.300> way<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.630> he<00:05:17.750> loves<00:05:18.680> nature

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919

religion in a way and he loves nature
and<00:05:19.310> so<00:05:20.030> it's<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.050> bit<00:05:21.200> of<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:22.210> two-sided<00:05:23.210> thing<00:05:23.600> I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
and so it's a bit of a two-sided thing I

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.040 
and so it's a bit of a two-sided thing I
