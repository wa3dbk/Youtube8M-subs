00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
famous crimes took place but it sure is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.630 
famous crimes took place but it sure is
a<00:00:47.789> fiction<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:49.020> historical<00:00:49.620> fiction<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
a fiction and it's historical fiction so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
a fiction and it's historical fiction so
it<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> challenge<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it kind of it's a challenge to get to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
it kind of it's a challenge to get to
the<00:00:53.010> authenticity<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.760> era<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.480> also

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the authenticity of that era but also

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.959 
the authenticity of that era but also
offers<00:00:54.989> us<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.350> exciting<00:00:55.800> opportunity

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
offers us an exciting opportunity

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.779 
offers us an exciting opportunity
because<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.149> fictional<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:58.550> deeper<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
because it's fictional to go deeper and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
because it's fictional to go deeper and
beyond<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.840> could<00:01:01.109> possibly<00:01:01.320> know

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
beyond what we could possibly know

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.390 
beyond what we could possibly know
without<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.730> being<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:02.969> ourselves

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.190 

and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.270> filming<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> show<00:01:10.020> like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and then when you're filming a show like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
and then when you're filming a show like
this<00:01:10.409> obviously<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.310> dramatic<00:01:11.490> how<00:01:12.270> do

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this obviously it's very dramatic how do

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.890 
this obviously it's very dramatic how do
you<00:01:12.510> keep<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.080> light<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.619> set<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:17.900> think

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you keep it light on set I think

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
you keep it light on set I think
everyone<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> cast<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> crew<00:01:19.979> ages<00:01:20.400> were

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so light naturally that it doesn't

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
so light naturally that it doesn't
really<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> try<00:01:23.549> too<00:01:23.610> hard<00:01:23.729> you
