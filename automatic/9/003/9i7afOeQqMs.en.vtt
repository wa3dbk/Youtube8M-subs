is<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:39.100> very<00:00:39.489> fast<00:00:40.090> machine<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.829> actually

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
is a very fast machine and it's actually

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.799 
is a very fast machine and it's actually
cheaper<00:00:42.430> than<00:00:42.780> those<00:00:43.780> imacs<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:46.660> we

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
cheaper than those imacs and here we

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.020 
cheaper than those imacs and here we

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
squirrels 788 which is okay next up we

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.920 
squirrels 788 which is okay next up we
have<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.870> desk<00:00:59.469> speed<00:00:59.980> test<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:01.090> write<00:01:01.449> speeds

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
have a desk speed test the write speeds

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.690 
have a desk speed test the write speeds
of<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.410> drive<00:01:02.710> far<00:01:03.070> around<00:01:03.630> 88<00:01:04.630> and<00:01:05.520> 90<00:01:06.520> and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
of the drive far around 88 and 90 and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.810 
of the drive far around 88 and 90 and
the<00:01:07.690> three<00:01:07.960> speeds<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.920> driver<00:01:09.310> also

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the three speeds of the driver also

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.970 
the three speeds of the driver also
around<00:01:10.510> AAA<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.920> 90<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.510> both<00:01:13.870> rien<00:01:14.470> right<00:01:14.740> are

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
around AAA and 90 so both rien right are

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.650 
around AAA and 90 so both rien right are
90<00:01:15.730> witches<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:17.500> course<00:01:18.040> pretty<00:01:18.610> slow<00:01:18.910> because

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
90 witches of course pretty slow because

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.790 
90 witches of course pretty slow because
it<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.230> a<00:01:20.260> 5400<00:01:21.250> RPM<00:01:21.790> hard<00:01:22.000> drive<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.840> i<00:01:23.470> highly

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
it is a 5400 RPM hard drive and i highly

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.450 
it is a 5400 RPM hard drive and i highly
recommend<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.670> pin<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.710> 7200<00:01:26.710> RPM<00:01:27.130> hard<00:01:27.310> drive

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
recommend a pin to a 7200 RPM hard drive

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
recommend a pin to a 7200 RPM hard drive
or<00:01:27.960> SSD<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.770> increase<00:01:30.280> their<00:01:30.490> dry<00:01:30.790> performance

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
or SSD to increase their dry performance

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.330 
or SSD to increase their dry performance
and<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:33.880> cenobite<00:01:34.870> release<00:01:35.350> 11.5

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
and here we have cenobite release 11.5

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.150 
and here we have cenobite release 11.5
and<00:01:36.640> has<00:01:37.330> gotten<00:01:37.830> opengl<00:01:38.830> full<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.540> 19.6<00:01:40.540> 9

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
and has gotten opengl full of 19.6 9

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.340 
and has gotten opengl full of 19.6 9
which<00:01:42.160> is<00:01:42.460> pretty<00:01:43.120> good<00:01:43.270> for<00:01:43.480> integrated

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
which is pretty good for integrated

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.370 
which is pretty good for integrated
graphics<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.510> celebrate<00:01:46.510> also<00:01:46.840> have<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.080> see

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
graphics and celebrate also have a see

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.920 
graphics and celebrate also have a see
if<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.770> pour<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.520> have<00:01:49.330> gone<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.810> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
if you pour and have gone in a

if you pour and have gone in a
squad<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:51.030> 3.38<00:01:52.030> which<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:52.870> also<00:01:53.350> very<00:01:53.620> good

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
squad of 3.38 which is also very good

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
squad of 3.38 which is also very good
for<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.420> dual-core<00:01:55.420> mobile<00:01:55.480> processor<00:01:57.150> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
for a dual-core mobile processor and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880 
for a dual-core mobile processor and
here<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.320> have<00:01:59.680> an<00:01:59.980> iMovie<00:02:00.880> export<00:02:01.390> test<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.500> i

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
here we have an iMovie export test and i

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.990 
here we have an iMovie export test and i
exported<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.700> one-minute<00:02:04.330> video<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.870> tiny<00:02:05.170> pee

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
exported a one-minute video and tiny pee

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.590 
exported a one-minute video and tiny pee
and<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.390> took<00:02:07.720> three<00:02:08.619> minutes<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.399> 20<00:02:09.970> seconds

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
and it took three minutes and 20 seconds

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.020 
and it took three minutes and 20 seconds
to<00:02:11.170> complete

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to complete

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.020 
to complete
s

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.210 

you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.030 

lastly<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.330> are<00:02:23.390> going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.780> open<00:02:24.040> 32

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
lastly we are going to open 32

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.790 
lastly we are going to open 32
applications<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.270> i<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:26.960> my<00:02:27.170> computer

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
applications that i have on my computer

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.820 
applications that i have on my computer
and<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.610> process<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.330> actually<00:02:29.840> pretty<00:02:30.350> slow

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and this process is actually pretty slow

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.640 
and this process is actually pretty slow
because<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.030> hard<00:02:32.300> drive<00:02:32.570> speed<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
because of the hard drive speed and it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.390 
because of the hard drive speed and it
took<00:02:34.150> 1<00:02:35.150> minute<00:02:35.180> 40<00:02:36.020> seconds<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> complete<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
took 1 minute 40 seconds to complete the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.810 
took 1 minute 40 seconds to complete the
test<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.930> ssds<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.980> basically<00:02:40.460> finished

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
test and for ssds it basically finished

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.840 
test and for ssds it basically finished
in<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.240> 20-30<00:02:41.840> seconds<00:02:42.770> just<00:02:43.190> cut<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
in like 20-30 seconds just cut it and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.030 
in like 20-30 seconds just cut it and
say<00:02:44.090> those<00:02:44.600> sense<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.110> watching<00:02:45.620> guys<00:02:45.740> I'm

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
say those sense of watching guys I'm
