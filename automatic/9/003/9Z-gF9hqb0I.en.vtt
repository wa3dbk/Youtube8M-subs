00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.230
 what is special about the sensation 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.910
 hannes the sensation heinz is different 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.769
 in some key points of 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.799
 ordinary dog harness or the 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.480
 using a normal neck band in 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.650
 the development of sensation hannes has 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.119
 get away from the trainings and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.230
 Educational methods in horses 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.180
 be inspired 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.950
 because horses and dogs react completely 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.020
 similar imprint and touch 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.700
 of course, there is no need to go along with it 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.800
 Rod and whip meant in the opposite 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.900
 gentle training and leadership 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.809
 Based on the pressure of the rider with the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.430
 Been exercising dogs react 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.650
 quite similar to this kind of leadership 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.860
 and that's the sensation hannes 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.180
 to use how it works easily 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.079
 explains if you get the sensation 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.090
 hannes looks 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.710
 in contrast to ordinary harnesses 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.960
 the leash will be under the front 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.050
 fixed in the chest and doing exactly that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.910
 the big difference from the sensation 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.250
 Hannes does not work against the dog in 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 it makes the dog heavier in this way 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.790
 Like the neck ties of the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.469
 case or the same with the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.390
 Use of ordinary neck bands 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.759
 where you only wore one against 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.110
 the dog is holding back the sensation 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.010
 hannes helps to connect with the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.690
 dog to produce 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.330
 the on the normal instincts of the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.340
 dogs are due to the tap senses 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.680
 the dog instinctively what we got from him 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.840
 if he should turn to us if 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.860
 he should come back if a curve 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.990
 should do left 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.720
 this allows a very effective 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.420
 and gentle training of the dog that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.680
 holder and the dog is fun 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.150
 the cock disturbs the dog at all 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.040
 he does not need a big one either 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.990
 getting used to it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.580
 you can go directly to the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.170
 Most watch one immediately 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.590
 drastic change in the behavior of the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.420
 dog 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 Here is an e-mail I just got 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.040

 collar and dishes selected and me 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.000

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.340
 dogs with general problems at the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.829
 Leash the dog pulls he jumps jumps 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.539
 up or jump forward 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.150
 dogs are extremely nervous and shy 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.470
 anxious are taken in the reason is appropriate 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.920
 the dishes for all the bigger ones 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.050
 dogs are not perfect 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.550
 a go and look at everyday life and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.040
 training for yourself and the dog 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.970
