00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.960 
on top of the bow or they they do
something<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.640> good<00:02:23.850> practice

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
something so it's really good practice

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
something so it's really good practice
to<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.569> play<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.080> note<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.040> check<00:02:26.310> your

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to just play a note and then check your

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
to just play a note and then check your
bow<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.600> move<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.019> playing<00:02:28.380> two

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
bow and then move on to playing two

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.949 
bow and then move on to playing two
notes<00:02:28.850> before<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> check<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.810> can

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
notes before you check and then you can

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.930 
notes before you check and then you can
play<00:02:31.140> three<00:02:31.410> notes<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.220> check<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
play three notes and then check and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.660 
play three notes and then check and
gradually<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:33.959> longer<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.670> if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
gradually make it a little longer and if

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.850 
gradually make it a little longer and if
everything's<00:02:36.120> good<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
everything's good then you can make it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.039 
everything's good then you can make it
even<00:02:38.160> longer<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.690> good<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.900> do

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
even longer but it's really good to do

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.080 
even longer but it's really good to do
that<00:02:40.200> while<00:02:40.799> you're<00:02:40.950> learning<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.760> make<00:02:41.880> sure

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that while you're learning to make sure

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.539 
that while you're learning to make sure
that<00:02:42.209> your<00:02:42.420> bow<00:02:42.569> hold<00:02:42.720> isn't<00:02:43.220> changing<00:02:44.220> while

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that your bow hold isn't changing while

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.890 
that your bow hold isn't changing while
you're<00:02:44.730> playing<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:45.630> often

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you're playing because that will often

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.289 
you're playing because that will often
happen<00:02:46.340> we'd<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.430> dinner<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.090> they

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
happen we'd be dinner so they don't they

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.500 
happen we'd be dinner so they don't they
don't<00:02:48.329> realize<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.390> good<00:02:51.450> thing

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
don't realize it so that's a good thing

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.289 
don't realize it so that's a good thing
