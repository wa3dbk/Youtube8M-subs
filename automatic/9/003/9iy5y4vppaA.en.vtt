overview this video I'll be taking a
look<00:00:05.279> at<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.700> new<00:00:06.029> level<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.450> I've<00:00:06.569> been

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
look at the new level that I've been

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.799 
look at the new level that I've been
working<00:00:07.049> on<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.730> some<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.059> assets<00:00:09.360> that

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
working on and some of the assets that

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.259 
working on and some of the assets that
I've<00:00:09.960> had<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.320> create<00:00:11.040> or<00:00:11.280> change<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.880> order<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
I've had to create or change in order to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.220 
I've had to create or change in order to
make<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:14.240> for<00:00:15.240> several<00:00:15.450> months<00:00:15.690> I've<00:00:15.960> been

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
make it for several months I've been

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.950 
make it for several months I've been
working<00:00:16.800> towards<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> goal<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.640> making<00:00:18.420> more

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
working towards the goal of making more

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
working towards the goal of making more
complete<00:00:19.380> looking<00:00:19.740> levels<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.760> better

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
complete looking levels that have better

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.130 
complete looking levels that have better
gameplay<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:23.490> order<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> achieve<00:00:24.810> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
gameplay and in order to achieve that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
gameplay and in order to achieve that
goal<00:00:25.199> I've<00:00:25.650> had<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.070> rework<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
goal I've had to rework a lot of the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.259 
goal I've had to rework a lot of the
existing<00:00:27.660> assets<00:00:28.400> I've<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.580> had<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> create

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
existing assets I've also had to create

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
existing assets I've also had to create
some<00:00:30.599> new<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.009> better

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
some new things here and there to better

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.370 
some new things here and there to better
utilize<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.090> systems<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.930> had<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> place

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
utilize the systems that we had in place

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
utilize the systems that we had in place
for<00:00:34.770> example<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.579> detail<00:00:36.120> objects<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
for example the detail objects on the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.590 
for example the detail objects on the
terrain<00:00:40.460> here's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> new<00:00:41.700> tree<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> started

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
terrain here's a new tree that I started

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.490 
terrain here's a new tree that I started
on<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.920> uses<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.430> existing<00:00:44.940> texture<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.140> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
on it uses an existing texture but it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
on it uses an existing texture but it
has<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> new<00:00:46.920> trunk<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> uses<00:00:48.420> some<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
has a new trunk and uses some of the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
has a new trunk and uses some of the
current<00:00:49.350> engine<00:00:49.530> features<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.610> better<00:00:52.850> for

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
current engine features a bit better for

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
current engine features a bit better for
example<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.199> original<00:00:55.770> trunk<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> left

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
example the original trunk on the left

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.139 
example the original trunk on the left
is<00:00:57.030> tinted<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> dark<00:00:58.289> color<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> new<00:00:59.969> one

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
is tinted a dark color but the new one

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
is tinted a dark color but the new one
is<00:01:00.329> designed<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.050> tinted<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.460> editor

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is designed to be tinted in the editor

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
is designed to be tinted in the editor
and<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.750> lighter<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and so it's much lighter you can make it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
and so it's much lighter you can make it
whatever<00:01:05.100> color<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.880> also<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
whatever color you want also because it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.280 
whatever color you want also because it
uses<00:01:07.290> detailed<00:01:08.070> textures<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.840> can<00:01:09.840> scale<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
uses detailed textures I can scale it to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
uses detailed textures I can scale it to
whatever<00:01:10.530> size<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.310> whereas<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.090> old<00:01:12.210> one

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
whatever size I like whereas the old one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.090 
whatever size I like whereas the old one
used<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> tiling<00:01:13.590> texture<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.939> said

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
used a tiling texture that was said

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
used a tiling texture that was said
another<00:01:17.100> feature<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.700> our<00:01:17.880> detailed<00:01:18.270> textures

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
another feature of our detailed textures

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.510 
another feature of our detailed textures
is<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.000> seamless<00:01:21.840> blending<00:01:22.290> between

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
is that it has seamless blending between

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
is that it has seamless blending between
different<00:01:23.520> texture<00:01:23.970> types<00:01:24.259> finally<00:01:25.259> because

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
different texture types finally because

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
different texture types finally because
it<00:01:25.860> has<00:01:26.070> object<00:01:27.030> normal<00:01:27.509> maps<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.040> tiling

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it has object normal maps and tiling

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
it has object normal maps and tiling
normal<00:01:29.369> maps<00:01:29.549> has<00:01:29.970> better<00:01:30.240> overall<00:01:30.540> shading

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
normal maps has better overall shading

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
normal maps has better overall shading
in<00:01:31.200> addition<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> texture<00:01:32.729> tweaks<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.240> minor

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
in addition to texture tweaks and minor

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380 
in addition to texture tweaks and minor
updates<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.680> level<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> couple<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
updates for that level I did a couple of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
updates for that level I did a couple of
sword<00:01:36.689> scabbards<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> may<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:37.920> seen

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sword scabbards which you may have seen

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.590 
sword scabbards which you may have seen

more<00:01:44.090> weapons<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:44.900> right<00:01:45.080> now<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.950> made<00:01:46.430> a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
more weapons but right now I just made a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.170 
more weapons but right now I just made a
scabbard<00:01:46.820> for<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.810> dog<00:01:48.110> sword<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.909> cat

scabbard for the dog sword and the cat
rapier<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.930> did<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.560> couple<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.250> different<00:01:52.580> color

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
rapier I did a couple of different color
