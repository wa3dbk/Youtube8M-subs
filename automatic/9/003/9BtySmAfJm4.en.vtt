00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.920 
right so in this case I will shift this
way<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:05.060> course<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.360> don't<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.780> be

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
way and of course you don't have to be

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.929 
way and of course you don't have to be
in<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.259> row<00:02:06.409> your<00:02:07.189> opponent<00:02:07.580> doesn't<00:02:07.700> have<00:02:07.850> to

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
in the row your opponent doesn't have to

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.369 
in the row your opponent doesn't have to
be<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.209> row<00:02:08.359> you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.689> shift<00:02:08.869> any<00:02:09.109> row<00:02:09.349> or

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
be in the row you can shift any row or

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.550 
be in the row you can shift any row or
any<00:02:09.739> column<00:02:10.159> regardless<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:12.680> inspector

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
any column regardless the inspector

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
any column regardless the inspector
can<00:02:14.489> also<00:02:14.640> shift<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.569> much<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.959> same<00:02:16.140> way

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
can also shift in this much the same way

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.490 
can also shift in this much the same way
so<00:02:16.770> as<00:02:16.800> inspector<00:02:17.340> i<00:02:17.370> could<00:02:17.610> shift<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.000> row

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.220 

the<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.890> killer<00:02:23.069> second<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.670> action<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.959> kill

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the the killer second of action to kill

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.800 
the the killer second of action to kill
is<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:26.459> same<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:26.790> before<00:02:27.090> he<00:02:27.300> chooses<00:02:27.690> someone

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
is the same as before he chooses someone

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
is the same as before he chooses someone
adjacent<00:02:28.349> his<00:02:28.440> secret<00:02:28.709> identity<00:02:28.800> which<00:02:29.400> may

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
adjacent his secret identity which may

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.920 
adjacent his secret identity which may
be<00:02:29.640> different<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.450> things<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.750> moved

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
be different know that things have moved

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.130 
be different know that things have moved
around<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.500> flips<00:02:32.489> them<00:02:32.610> down<00:02:32.849> now<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
around and flips them down now that the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.839 
around and flips them down now that the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
inspector secret identity is somewhere

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.059 
inspector secret identity is somewhere
on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> board<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.140> killer<00:02:37.380> manages<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
on the board if the killer manages to

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.380 
on the board if the killer manages to
kill<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> inspector<00:02:38.819> he<00:02:38.970> wins<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> game<00:02:41.390> the
