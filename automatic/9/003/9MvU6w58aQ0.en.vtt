steel
this<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.890> made<00:02:09.160> exactly<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.630> looks<00:02:10.840> like

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this is made exactly so it looks like

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
are just made so so one is premature if

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.650 
are just made so so one is premature if
I<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:21.160> now<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> one<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.940> more<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:22.480> less<00:02:22.630> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
I can now the one is more or less a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.800 
I can now the one is more or less a
survival<00:02:23.470> ten<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.660> have

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
survival ten so but I can I can have

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.010 
survival ten so but I can I can have
those<00:02:26.020> two<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.830> can<00:02:27.010> flip<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.790> over<00:02:28.090> switch

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
those two and I can flip it over switch

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.480 
those two and I can flip it over switch
them<00:02:29.170> around<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.880> feel<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.459> I
