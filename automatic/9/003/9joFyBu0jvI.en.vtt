ideas and I'm not a little experiment

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.359 
ideas and I'm not a little experiment
here<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.640> my<00:00:23.699> backyard<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.630> want<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
here in my backyard because I want to

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.390 
here in my backyard because I want to
increase<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.699> yields<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:27.810> chickens<00:00:28.400> feed

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
increase the yields of my chickens feed

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.190 
increase the yields of my chickens feed
and<00:00:30.619> some<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> already<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.840> how<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> do

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and some of you already know how to do

and some of you already know how to do
this<00:00:35.840> growing<00:00:36.840> fodder<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> actually

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this growing fodder this is actually

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.520 
this growing fodder this is actually
from<00:00:40.230> scratch<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> Peck<00:00:41.660> feeds<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:43.320> where

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
from scratch and Peck feeds that's where

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.799 
from scratch and Peck feeds that's where
I<00:00:43.559> buy<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.610> seeds<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> stuff

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I buy all my my seeds and all that stuff

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
I buy all my my seeds and all that stuff
our<00:00:45.960> Maya<00:00:46.200> chicken<00:00:46.950> feed

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
our Maya chicken feed

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
our Maya chicken feed
and<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.390> their<00:00:48.510> scratch<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and this is actually their scratch and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.880 
and this is actually their scratch and
their<00:00:50.010> scratch<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> bunch<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.899> seeds

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
their scratch just has a bunch of seeds

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.630 
their scratch just has a bunch of seeds
mostly<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.789> believe<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.510> wheatgrass<00:00:55.640> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mostly I believe it's wheatgrass but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299 
mostly I believe it's wheatgrass but
anyway<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.899> running<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.260> tiny<00:00:58.530> experiment

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
anyway I'm running a tiny experiment

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
anyway I'm running a tiny experiment
because<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> wanted<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.329> how

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
because I wanted to see you know how how

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.219 
because I wanted to see you know how how
how<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> grows<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.559> everything<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.280> so

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
how it grows and everything like that so

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
how it grows and everything like that so
because<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> feed<00:01:07.890> blocks<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.790> fodder

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because I want to feed blocks of fodder

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.859 
because I want to feed blocks of fodder
to<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.960> chickens<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> that's<00:01:12.510> basically

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to my chickens and so that's basically

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.280 
to my chickens and so that's basically
just<00:01:13.170> blocks<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> sprouted<00:01:14.250> seeds<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.290> this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just blocks of sprouted seeds and this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
just blocks of sprouted seeds and this
is<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> six<00:01:17.400> day<00:01:17.729> period<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.689> even

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
is about a six day period here even

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.789 
is about a six day period here even
though<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.229> only<00:01:19.290> four<00:01:19.740> block<00:01:20.040> holes<00:01:20.540> I

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
though there's only four block holes I

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.350 
though there's only four block holes I
only<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> four<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.210> I'm

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
only have four right now because I'm

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.350 
only have four right now because I'm
gonna<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.630> building<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.049> system<00:01:25.290> basically<00:01:26.360> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
gonna be building a system basically and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
gonna be building a system basically and
I<00:01:27.450> wanted<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.259> build<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I wanted to see if I was gonna build a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.569 
I wanted to see if I was gonna build a
system<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.829> days<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.400> just

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
system and so this for days I just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.870 
system and so this for days I just
watered<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:34.229> draining<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:34.880> but

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
watered it I was draining right now but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.039 
watered it I was draining right now but
basically<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> want<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
basically what you want to do is you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
basically what you want to do is you
want<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> soak<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> more<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
want to soak it I'm gonna do a more in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.289 
want to soak it I'm gonna do a more in
depth<00:01:39.509> video<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.259> my<00:01:40.439> mic<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.210> know

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
depth video when I get my mic you know

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.490 
depth video when I get my mic you know
my<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:43.439> version<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:45.049> smaller<00:01:46.049> version<00:01:46.350> because

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
my my version of smaller version because

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
my my version of smaller version because
I<00:01:46.560> only<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> three<00:01:47.040> chickens<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.140> all

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I only have three chickens and so all

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.429 
I only have three chickens and so all
the<00:01:49.350> fodder<00:01:50.210> things<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> help

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the fodder things that are going to help

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
the fodder things that are going to help
you<00:01:52.560> sprout<00:01:52.950> fodder<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.670> chickens

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you sprout fodder for your chickens

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.459 
you sprout fodder for your chickens
they're<00:01:54.960> generally<00:01:55.829> bigger<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.290> don't

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
they're generally bigger and I don't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.740 
they're generally bigger and I don't
have<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.159> but<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> wanted<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> increase

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
have that so but I wanted to increase

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.010 
have that so but I wanted to increase
the<00:02:00.869> yields<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:02.149> my<00:02:03.149> basically<00:02:03.570> my<00:02:03.689> chicken

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the yields of my my basically my chicken

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
the yields of my my basically my chicken
feed<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.920> supposed<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> increase<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
feed and this is supposed to increase it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.979 
feed and this is supposed to increase it
by<00:02:06.119> about<00:02:06.149> 80%<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.610> anyway<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> want

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
by about 80% and so anyway what you want

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
by about 80% and so anyway what you want
to<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> soak<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> seed<00:02:11.220> for

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to do is you want to soak the seed for

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.330 
to do is you want to soak the seed for
24<00:02:12.150> hours<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
24 hours just to get it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
24 hours just to get it
to<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.939> want<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.299> sprout<00:02:15.629> more<00:02:15.959> or

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to where it's want to sprout more or

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
to where it's want to sprout more or
easily<00:02:17.719> then<00:02:18.719> after<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.319> take<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.799> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
easily then after that you take it you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.660 
easily then after that you take it you
drain<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:21.019> each<00:02:22.019> container<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.920> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
drain it into each container and this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.809 
drain it into each container and this
stuff<00:02:23.939> sprouts<00:02:24.329> over<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.659> nine<00:02:24.930> day<00:02:25.109> period<00:02:25.819> to

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
stuff sprouts over a nine day period to

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.880 
stuff sprouts over a nine day period to
its<00:02:27.299> full<00:02:27.709> potential

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
its full potential

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.970 
its full potential
and<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:30.599> then<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.409> can<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.859> whole

and and then your you can take the whole

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.080 
and and then your you can take the whole
block<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.519> can<00:02:32.549> feed<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.970> your

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.059 
important because if not this stuff will
rot<00:03:41.040> or<00:03:41.489> it'll<00:03:41.879> get<00:03:42.030> moldy<00:03:42.449> quick<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.799> as<00:03:43.949> you
