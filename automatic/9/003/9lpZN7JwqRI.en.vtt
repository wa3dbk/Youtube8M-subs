00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.759 
I've been doing for the last couple of
weeks<00:00:15.300> and<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:15.840> worked<00:00:16.019> me<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.590> really

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
weeks and it's worked me really really

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.230 
weeks and it's worked me really really
well<00:00:16.949> because<00:00:17.340> my<00:00:17.490> skin<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:17.789> been<00:00:18.000> quite

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
well because my skin has been quite

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.509 
well because my skin has been quite
dehydrated<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.230> eyes<00:00:19.410> ill<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.339> it's

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
dehydrated from my eyes ill and it's

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.550 
dehydrated from my eyes ill and it's
still<00:00:20.759> not<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.150> back<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.329> normal<00:00:21.839> so<00:00:22.199> I'm

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
still not really back to normal so I'm

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800 
still not really back to normal so I'm
using<00:00:22.919> slightly<00:00:23.369> different<00:00:23.519> products<00:00:24.210> than<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
using slightly different products than I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
using slightly different products than I
would<00:00:25.019> normally<00:00:25.409> use<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.909> they

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
would normally use but I think they

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.029 
would normally use but I think they
create<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.570> gorgeous<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.409> of<00:00:28.529> radiance

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.170 
they're too cool don't really sit well
on<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.440> skin<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.040> tone<00:04:20.280> doesn't<00:04:20.669> look<00:04:20.850> too

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
on the skin the tone doesn't look too

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.450 
on the skin the tone doesn't look too
right<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.720> really<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.440> gold<00:04:22.710> toned<00:04:23.010> ones<00:04:23.250> as

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
but this one with a rose tone I think is

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.469 
but this one with a rose tone I think is
really<00:04:26.370> really<00:04:26.820> pretty

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and it's not too strong so you don't

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.320 
and it's not too strong so you don't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
it's it's mousse like I suppose and when

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.610 
it's it's mousse like I suppose and when
you<00:05:06.150> apply<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.780> doesn't<00:05:07.110> affect<00:05:07.380> anything

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.140 
you apply it it doesn't affect anything
underneath<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.430> that's<00:05:08.550> why<00:05:08.760> I've<00:05:08.880> chosen

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
underneath so that's why I've chosen

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.840 
underneath so that's why I've chosen
this<00:05:09.390> one<00:05:09.630> just<00:05:10.230> as<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> final<00:05:10.710> layer<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.370> don't

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
this one just as a final layer I don't

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.240 
this one just as a final layer I don't
want<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.210> streaking<00:05:13.100> whatever<00:05:14.100> is

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
want to be streaking whatever is

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.010 
want to be streaking whatever is
underneath<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.820> making<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.330> patchy<00:05:15.660> and

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
underneath and making it all patchy and

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.920 
underneath and making it all patchy and
weird<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:17.310> sits<00:05:17.640> very<00:05:17.940> well<00:05:18.240> on<00:05:18.450> top<00:05:18.720> I

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
weird so that sits very well on top I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.290 
weird so that sits very well on top I
just<00:05:18.960> pop<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.470> little<00:05:19.590> bit<00:05:19.920> more<00:05:20.130> on<00:05:20.790> actually

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
just pop a little bit more on actually

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.990 
just pop a little bit more on actually
just<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.170> see<00:05:22.500> it's<00:05:23.010> got<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.460> dry

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
just so you can see it's got a dry

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.820 
just so you can see it's got a dry
finish<00:05:24.330> rather<00:05:24.750> than<00:05:25.020> anything<00:05:25.290> kind<00:05:25.770> of

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
finish rather than anything kind of

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.590 
finish rather than anything kind of
slippy<00:05:26.370> or<00:05:28.580> greasy<00:05:29.580> or<00:05:29.730> anything<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.180> I

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
slippy or greasy or anything like that I

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.510 
slippy or greasy or anything like that I
just<00:05:31.200> find<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.590> texture<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.070> this<00:05:32.220> quite

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
just find the texture of this quite

rather<00:06:11.610> on<00:06:11.850> my<00:06:11.970> eyes<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:13.040> this<00:06:14.040> is<00:06:14.100> actually

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
rather on my eyes and this is actually

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.610

longer<00:06:19.470> I<00:06:19.590> find<00:06:19.980> them<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.340> technique<00:06:20.700> chubby

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
longer I find them the technique chubby

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.520 
longer I find them the technique chubby
sticks<00:06:21.960> for<00:06:22.170> eyes<00:06:22.290> a<00:06:22.680> lot<00:06:23.580> longer<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:24.530> they're

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
sticks for eyes a lot longer and they're

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.200 
sticks for eyes a lot longer and they're
really<00:06:25.710> easy<00:06:25.800> to<00:06:26.190> blend<00:06:26.370> so<00:06:26.670> I've<00:06:26.790> drawn<00:06:27.030> this

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
really easy to blend so I've drawn this

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.420 
really easy to blend so I've drawn this
on<00:06:27.420> just<00:06:27.690> around<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.590> lash<00:06:28.800> line<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.370> then

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
on just around the lash line and then

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.160 
on just around the lash line and then
I've<00:06:29.820> buffed<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.300> in<00:06:30.390> really<00:06:30.690> really<00:06:30.960> quickly

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
I've buffed it in really really quickly

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.010 
I've buffed it in really really quickly
before<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:31.740> sets<00:06:32.040> with<00:06:32.340> a<00:06:32.760> stiff<00:06:33.420> kind<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:33.900> eye

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
before it sets with a stiff kind of eye

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.320 
before it sets with a stiff kind of eye
brushes<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:34.860> switch<00:06:35.070> now<00:06:35.340> it's<00:06:35.730> probably<00:06:36.150> not

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
brushes and switch now it's probably not

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.320 
brushes and switch now it's probably not
the<00:06:36.810> ideal<00:06:36.840> one<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.560> have<00:06:37.680> used<00:06:37.980> but<00:06:38.250> um<00:06:38.550> it

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
the ideal one to have used but um it

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.070 
the ideal one to have used but um it
worked<00:06:39.600> quite<00:06:39.780> well

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
worked quite well

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.320 
worked quite well
and<00:06:40.290> so<00:06:41.100> I've<00:06:41.340> buffed<00:06:41.610> it<00:06:41.790> in<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.150> it's<00:06:42.270> just

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
and so I've buffed it in and it's just

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.710 
and so I've buffed it in and it's just
given<00:06:43.260> a<00:06:43.710> little

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
given a little

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.510 
given a little
kind<00:06:45.720> of<00:06:45.810> definition<00:06:46.350> around<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.680> eye<00:06:46.710> it's<00:06:47.490> a

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
kind of definition around the eye it's a

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.550 
kind of definition around the eye it's a
very<00:06:47.759> easy<00:06:47.970> way<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.270> doing<00:06:48.630> it<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:49.050> that's

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
very easy way of doing it and that's

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.620 
very easy way of doing it and that's
quite<00:06:49.889> cheap<00:06:50.160> too<00:06:50.460> really<00:06:51.030> cheap<00:06:51.270> actually

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630

if you want to have a look at last

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
if you want to have a look at last
week's<00:07:13.740> tutorial<00:07:14.060> which<00:07:15.060> is<00:07:15.300> a<00:07:16.430> slightly

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
week's tutorial which is a slightly

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.170 
week's tutorial which is a slightly
different<00:07:17.639> effect<00:07:17.940> it's<00:07:18.419> more<00:07:20.000> under<00:07:21.000> those

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
different effect it's more under those

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.760 
different effect it's more under those
different<00:07:21.599> products<00:07:21.780> and<00:07:22.199> it's<00:07:22.530> different

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
different products and it's different

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.240 
different products and it's different
