00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
in this video we'll demonstrate how to

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.590 
in this video we'll demonstrate how to
winterize<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.149> motorcycle<00:00:03.929> or<00:00:04.200> ATV<00:00:05.600> it's

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
winterize a motorcycle or ATV it's

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.120 
winterize a motorcycle or ATV it's
important<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.319> store<00:00:07.620> your<00:00:07.770> machine

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
important that you store your machine

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.100 
important that you store your machine
the<00:00:08.280> correct<00:00:08.580> way<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.000> not<00:00:09.269> only<00:00:09.450> protect<00:00:09.690> it

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the correct way to not only protect it

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.259 
the correct way to not only protect it
but<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.800> also<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> ready<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> ride<00:00:11.910> and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
but to also have it ready to ride and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.310 
but to also have it ready to ride and
riding<00:00:12.630> season<00:00:12.960> comes<00:00:13.170> around<00:00:15.109> we've<00:00:16.109> put

riding season comes around we've put

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.870 
riding season comes around we've put
together<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.770> video<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.220> hit<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> main

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
together this video to hit all the main

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.370 
together this video to hit all the main
points<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.449> preparing<00:00:18.900> your<00:00:19.050> bike<00:00:19.199> for

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
points of preparing your bike for

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
points of preparing your bike for
storage<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.850> only<00:00:21.029> goes<00:00:21.270> for

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
storage and this not only goes for

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
storage and this not only goes for
winter<00:00:21.840> storage<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.949> also<00:00:23.100> be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
winter storage but it can also be

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.769 
winter storage but it can also be
applied<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.820> storing<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.240> bike<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.660> an

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
applied to storing your bike for an

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.130 
applied to storing your bike for an
extended<00:00:25.289> period<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> time<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:26.039> well<00:00:27.019> we'll<00:00:28.019> be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
extended period of time as well we'll be

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.470 
extended period of time as well we'll be
working<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> 1996<00:00:29.580> harley-davidson

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
working on a 1996 harley-davidson

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
working on a 1996 harley-davidson
Softail<00:00:30.660> Fat<00:00:31.199> Boy<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:32.099> steps<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.640> used

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
Softail Fat Boy these steps can be used

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
Softail Fat Boy these steps can be used
to<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.809> machine<00:00:34.170> ready<00:00:34.380> for

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to get just about any machine ready for

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.479 
to get just about any machine ready for
storage<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> first<00:00:37.649> step<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> winterizing

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
storage so the first step of winterizing

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
storage so the first step of winterizing
is<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.030> basically<00:00:39.239> perform<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> full<00:00:40.260> service

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
is to basically perform a full service

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
is to basically perform a full service
on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> motorcycle<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.480> Harley<00:00:42.840> Owners

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
on the motorcycle for your Harley Owners

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.690 
on the motorcycle for your Harley Owners
this<00:00:43.410> means<00:00:43.649> changing<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> motor<00:00:44.280> oil<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this means changing the motor oil and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.910 
this means changing the motor oil and
filter<00:00:45.469> along<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> tranny<00:00:46.980> oil<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
filter along with the tranny oil and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.600 
filter along with the tranny oil and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
primary case oil for those shaft driven

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
primary case oil for those shaft driven
bikes<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.420> good<00:00:57.570> idea<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.870> change<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bikes it's a good idea to change the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
bikes it's a good idea to change the
rear<00:00:58.500> diff<00:00:58.739> case<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.250> final<00:00:59.699> drive<00:00:59.940> fluid<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
rear diff case or final drive fluid and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
rear diff case or final drive fluid and
you<00:01:00.690> change<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> motor<00:01:01.260> oil<00:01:01.579> we're<00:01:02.579> doing

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you change the motor oil we're doing

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
you change the motor oil we're doing
this<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> remove<00:01:03.300> any<00:01:03.480> contaminants<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this to remove any contaminants that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
this to remove any contaminants that
have<00:01:04.500> made<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.250> oil<00:01:05.460> or

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have made the way into your oil or

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
have made the way into your oil or
fluids<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.510> could<00:01:06.689> potentially<00:01:07.320> cause

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
fluids which could potentially cause

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
fluids which could potentially cause
damage<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.580> left<00:01:08.790> inside<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> bike

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
damage if they are left inside the bike

damage if they are left inside the bike
during<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> storage<00:01:11.090> make<00:01:12.090> sure<00:01:12.330> you're

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
during the storage make sure you're

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
during the storage make sure you're
replacing<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> crush<00:01:13.409> washers<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.130> o-rings

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
replacing the crush washers or o-rings

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.990 
replacing the crush washers or o-rings
on<00:01:14.909> each<00:01:15.119> strain<00:01:15.479> bolt<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.020> prevent<00:01:16.350> any<00:01:16.530> leaks

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
on each strain bolt to prevent any leaks

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.219 
on each strain bolt to prevent any leaks
it's<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:18.479> idea<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.810> check<00:01:19.049> your

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it's also a good idea to check your

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.100 
it's also a good idea to check your
bike's<00:01:19.409> coolant<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.310> liquid<00:01:20.520> cooled

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
bike's coolant if it's liquid cooled

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.030 
bike's coolant if it's liquid cooled
antifreeze<00:01:22.110> typically<00:01:22.650> lasts<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> couple

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
antifreeze typically lasts a couple

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370 
antifreeze typically lasts a couple
years<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.450> unsure<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.990> condition

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
years so if you're unsure the condition

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
years so if you're unsure the condition
I'd<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.590> coolant<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.189> best<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.610> go

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'd be coolant it's best to just go

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.990 
I'd be coolant it's best to just go
ahead<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> change<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.690
