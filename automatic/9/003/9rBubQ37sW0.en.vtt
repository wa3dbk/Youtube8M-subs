00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.460 
was a 16 year old junior in high school
I<00:02:25.450> was<00:02:26.450> dreaming<00:02:26.750> about<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.170> my<00:02:27.230> first

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
I was dreaming about one in my first

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.820 
I was dreaming about one in my first
muscle<00:02:27.860> car<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.970> saw<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.360> black<00:02:29.540> 67<00:02:30.440> rs/ss

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.250 
muscle car and I saw this black 67 rs/ss
come<00:02:31.220> out<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.270> movie<00:02:32.540> better<00:02:32.750> off<00:02:32.960> dead

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
come out and the movie better off dead

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.730
