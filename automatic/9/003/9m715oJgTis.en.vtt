 is not that the game is weird what happens 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.070
 we all know that there are games that 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.630
 they have file content and others that do not 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.100
 they have file content which is what 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.860
 It happens that many people do not see that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 file the content is scared will be alarmed and 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.199

 I do this because there are questions that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.960
 I see that they are very interesting for all 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.430

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.979
 that's why I want to answer if you have 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.890
 Any question is worth any question 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.100
 you put it in this video and yes I think 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.920
 what is important for all of us 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.229

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.050
 what comments subscribe I would like 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.600
 Well, it is not clear to everyone to think that it is 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.789
 impossible to do is that thanks to all 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.710
 you want to subscribe and subscribe 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.780
 comment and above all that you give me support 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.150
 so you make this possible yes no 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.070
 we covered videos so well let's go to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.130
 mess you first have to have in 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 account that when you download a game or 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.770
 dlc whatever and the folder is content 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.040
 the first one has to configure the usb 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.159
 the system configuration console 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.920
 storage and you give the usb and you 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.140
 configure and everything is ready to 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.810
 put the computer and pass it by horizon 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.480
 those of content have to happen yes or yes 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.670
 Now I'm going to show you the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 default the file there are many 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.920
 7 files found only in contain 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 the usb is not configured in the console 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.190
 normal already works ok here you have a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.920
 example this is not is not configured 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.750
 OK is normal and this is configured 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670
 in the difference is that if it is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.310
 configured by the console you see that it is 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.610
 full it's worth but inside it's not there's no 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.510
 nothing will do nothing but be inside 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.310
 of some games is not the east but the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 what we are going to do today is this client is 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.450
 by vale as you download the game 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.270
 you see there are many files here is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.360
 the fire the people it scares because it 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.710
 download the game ostia we have no content 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.230
 until we erase what we have done wrong 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.330
 brito you're a bastard then what what 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.020
 we have to do before to do 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.450
 these things 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.100
 look at this tutorial of course first 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.010
 let's go through the content folder 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.110
 you have to have the horizon program 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 me on my facebook facebook page 99 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.150
 or by private message I pass the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.450
 Download link is worth you at the level of 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.090
 Virus and free download voucher 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.209
 free on all that but you have to do 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.180
 is when it's been configured or 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.410
 you will recognize it you have to put 6 with 96 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.170
 gigas 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.240
 what to do is injun fail this for the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.880
 games or times they have folder 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.240
 contain I repeat because no 9 more title 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.100
 OK 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.960
 here I have the folder contemplate for 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.470
 contain put here to have it more to 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.140
 hand and sometimes this is a style of doing 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.850
 is for example this one we do not imagine 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.480
 which is a game worth the numbers 0 2 x 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.780
 of the file open then it will be passed 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.230
 It depends on what is late what is not 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.780
 it weighs nothing is worth it would be the way 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.270
 pass the game with ten 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.500
 this is an lcd as a fast partner but 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.290
 If it is a game, it will try a little 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.810
 it's better this is happy and now if 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.390
 we want to pass these files of faul 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.200
 It's worth nheolis what you have to do is 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:30.230
 this is very simple put your usb is and 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.660
 configure what this is worth and what 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.320
 you have to do is 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.120
 look for the game worth you jump all the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.940
 files first then you have to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.800
 create a separate folder that 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.960
 put the name of the game in this 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.070
 case as was kinect sports because it 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.000
 comes after I passed it all on your rest 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.610
 will be just dance 2015 the only thing 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.220
 what to do select drag and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.840
 leave it here is worth what happens as 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.370
 I already have it, it's silly, you see they're 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.590
 all the files now we will proceed to 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.420
 see it in the fifteenth is has already passed all 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.220
 the files to all the judges that 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.160
 we have to go to managers of 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.200
 file be careful with these things that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.970
 we have to look for the usb in principle 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.830
 it seems to me that this is the one in 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.250
 content you will see here the 300 this folder 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.690
 and here is what is being the tlc 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.030
 if you have put a game here it is done 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.950
 game then playing from here to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.630
 then play from here or if you want 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.990
 move to hard drives only going to 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.990
 be like that 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.830
 and give him to move x is already worth that in 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.860
 beginning the conte 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.630
 once has already done with we have general 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.900
 We are interested in the 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:52.770
 which brings more headaches we go 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.930
 to usb then this one is not this one 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.360
 is this worth it because you see are 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.740
 many folders and here is the client 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.229
 It is by xerais 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.810
 our contemplate if it is of favor I have 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.889
 that giving this game a foul payment is 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.590
 the one that I said you have to have the 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.419
 answer yes no it will not work then 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.590
 As you can see, the game is the only thing 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.569
 what we have to do is connect the 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.710
 kinect and be well placed 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.710
 I will try it before 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.710
 but 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.210
 as you can see that it works there is no fucking 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:47.630
 game resist you know what 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.630
 to the best and best points 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.250
 let's go to the mess
