00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.290
 for the second part of the river 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.250
 we are coming 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.119
 the second part of the code legacy 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.119
 Start now 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.230
 and finally I received a blow from 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.730
 whereabouts of my editor is in the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.590
 springs and are about to send it to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 secret place you can not imagine what 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.099
 important that we find it 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.110
 before boarding you do not have to 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.610
 jure what looks to be worked 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.890
 in something very serious so that the dvd 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.030
 We were trying to find out the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.500
 truth about how the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 drivers asked them how 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.390
 you got your powers not suddenly a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.660
 day based on being a simple tough guy to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.820
 be a hard one with powers and editor and I 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.290
 received information that the PP has 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270
 been involved in the mass dissemination 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 of the constructor gene during the past 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.450
 five 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.040
 I think they somehow discovered that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.810
 caused the drivers to return 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.820
 and they figured out how to get hold of it or 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.620
 control it to use them at will 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.270
 that's why today there are so many 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.980
 drivers sanctioned by man 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.230
 first they do something they can not 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.740
 control and then try to control what 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.250
 typical of the dv I will find your editor no 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.250
 you worry 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.719

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.480
 suddenly found that it was about this 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.170
