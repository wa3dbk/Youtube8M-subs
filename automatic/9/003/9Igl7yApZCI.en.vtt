mind<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.289> D<00:00:31.500> shoes<00:00:31.769> come<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.369> blue<00:00:32.669> laces

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
mind the D shoes come with blue laces

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
mind the D shoes come with blue laces
but<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.380> replaced<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.010> blue<00:00:35.190> laces<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.910> white

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
but I replaced the blue laces with white

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.560 
but I replaced the blue laces with white
laces<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.100> blue<00:00:38.489> laces<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> was

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
laces because the blue laces when I was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
laces because the blue laces when I was
tying<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.020> shoes<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.649> day<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.579> shoelace

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
tying my shoes one day the shoelace

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.770 
tying my shoes one day the shoelace
actually<00:00:42.629> ripped<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.350> half<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.420> replaced

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
actually ripped in half so i replaced

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.430 
actually ripped in half so i replaced
the<00:00:46.879> laces<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> i<00:00:48.960> don't<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the laces and i don't think that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.959 
the laces and i don't think that
anything<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.010> guys<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.340> worry<00:00:50.489> about<00:00:50.579> i

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
anything you guys should worry about i

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.760 
anything you guys should worry about i
think<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> defect<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> laces

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
think it was just a defect in the laces

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
think it was just a defect in the laces
that<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> happen<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:54.989> hop<00:00:55.140> right

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and the only problem I've really had

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.350 
and the only problem I've really had
with<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.210> shoes<00:01:39.680> was<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.009> supra<00:01:41.909> logo

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
with these shoes was the supra logo

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.280 
with these shoes was the supra logo
glued<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.920> back<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.520> shoe<00:01:44.790> actually

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
glued on the back of the shoe actually

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
glued on the back of the shoe actually
came<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.009> shoes<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.689> one

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
came off one of my shoes and on this one

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.880 
came off one of my shoes and on this one
it's<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> peeling<00:01:50.340> off<00:01:51.140> which<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it's kind of peeling off which kind of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
it's kind of peeling off which kind of
stinks<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.210> only<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> one

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
stinks you know because I only have one

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
stinks you know because I only have one
logo<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> i'm<00:01:55.619> thinking<00:01:55.799> i<00:01:56.009> might<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.250> peel

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
logo and i'm thinking i might just peel

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
logo and i'm thinking i might just peel
this<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.969> off<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.450> make<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.719> look<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> same

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
but otherwise it's a really comfortable

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.969 
but otherwise it's a really comfortable
shoe<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:04.579> thinly<00:02:05.579> padded<00:02:06.320> rim<00:02:07.320> around
