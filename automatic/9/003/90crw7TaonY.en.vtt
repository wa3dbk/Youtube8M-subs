00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.740 
it is kind of like a pulsing breathing
sort<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.399> thing<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.300> actually<00:02:10.450> even

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
sort of thing you can actually even

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.660 
sort of thing you can actually even
adjust<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.349> brightness<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.519> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
adjust the brightness of it and the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.960 
adjust the brightness of it and the
frequency<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.709> as<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.640> can<00:02:15.700> see<00:02:15.879> it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
frequency of it so the as you can see it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.910 
frequency of it so the as you can see it
pulses<00:02:16.390> through<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.170> pretty<00:02:17.440> cool<00:02:17.620> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
pulses through it is pretty cool this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.369 
pulses through it is pretty cool this
isn't<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> coolest<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.849> them<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.810> let's

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
isn't the coolest of them all so let's

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.660 
isn't the coolest of them all so let's
go<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.800> second<00:02:21.190> one<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.680> second<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
go to the second one the second one is a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.330 
go to the second one the second one is a
wave<00:02:25.300> marquee<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:26.950> looks<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.250> bit

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
wave marquee so this looks a bit

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
wave marquee so this looks a bit
headachy<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:27.970> moment<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.569> let<00:02:28.720> me<00:02:28.750> just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
headachy at the moment so let me just

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.539 
headachy at the moment so let me just
put<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.230> down<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:29.980> oh<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
put it down and it's like oh it's like a

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.780 
put it down and it's like oh it's like a
ripple<00:02:30.970> wave<00:02:31.450> sort<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.230> thing<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.370> one

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
ripple wave sort of thing so this one

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.880 
ripple wave sort of thing so this one
you<00:02:34.000> can't<00:02:34.420> really<00:02:34.989> adjust<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> brightness

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
you can't really adjust the brightness

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.890 
you can't really adjust the brightness
you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.489> just<00:02:36.640> adjust<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.000> speed<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
you can just adjust the speed so that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.460 
you can just adjust the speed so that
looks<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.349> quite<00:02:38.590> epileptic<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:39.640> like

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
looks like quite epileptic so it's like

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.530 
looks like quite epileptic so it's like
yep<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.519> remember<00:02:42.610> those<00:02:42.940> or<00:02:43.239> eight

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
yep and do you remember those or eight

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
yep and do you remember those or eight
to<00:02:43.690> 10<00:02:43.870> headphones<00:02:44.319> where<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.560> had<00:02:44.709> all<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
to 10 headphones where you had all the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.009 
to 10 headphones where you had all the
crazy<00:02:45.549> lights<00:02:45.880> when<00:02:46.030> someone<00:02:46.269> told<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.599> yeah

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
crazy lights when someone told you yeah

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.780 
crazy lights when someone told you yeah
this<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:48.670> your

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
this is like that just but just for your

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.339 
this is like that just but just for your
keyboard<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.900> next<00:02:50.230> mode<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.049> called

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
keyboard so next mode is it is called

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.339 
keyboard so next mode is it is called
the<00:02:53.739> snake<00:02:54.040> marquee<00:02:54.430> mode<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.360> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.110> it's

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
the snake marquee mode you can see it's

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.809 
the snake marquee mode you can see it's
like<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.709> game<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.069> state<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.459> guess<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
like the game of state I guess the

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.420 
like the game of state I guess the
people<00:02:58.120> at<00:02:58.209> ducky<00:02:58.540> offense<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.069> Nokia

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
people at ducky offense of the the Nokia

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.580 
people at ducky offense of the the Nokia
game<00:03:00.610> snake<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.540> speed<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:01.989> up<00:03:02.170> really

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
game snake so you can speed it up really

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.009 
game snake so you can speed it up really
quick<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.209> put<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.660> down<00:03:04.780> really

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
quick or you can put it down really

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.789 
quick or you can put it down really
slowly<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:09.069> cool<00:03:09.459> i<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.940> this

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
slowly this is really cool i like this

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.140 
slowly this is really cool i like this
it's<00:03:11.799> more<00:03:12.069> distracting<00:03:12.549> anything<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> know

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it's more distracting anything you know

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.190 
it's more distracting anything you know
when<00:03:13.239> you're<00:03:13.329> playing<00:03:13.480> dota<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.049> looks

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
when you're playing dota and so it looks

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.699 
when you're playing dota and so it looks
over<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.829> you<00:03:15.459> probably<00:03:15.700> strike<00:03:16.060> them

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
over you and you probably strike them

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.039 
over you and you probably strike them
next<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:17.980> are<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.549> reactive<00:03:19.000> mode<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.630> let's

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
next one are the reactive mode so let's

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.680 
next one are the reactive mode so let's
go<00:03:20.350> into<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.889> reactive<00:03:21.250> modes<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.389> you<00:03:22.480> see

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
go into the reactive modes so you see

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.900 
go into the reactive modes so you see
probably<00:03:23.230> think<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.680> know<00:03:23.799> what<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.700> a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
probably think you know what it's just a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
probably think you know what it's just a
black<00:03:25.329> hole<00:03:26.310> check<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.519> out<00:03:27.549> way<00:03:28.540> too<00:03:28.600> fast

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
black hole check that out way too fast

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.289 
black hole check that out way too fast
I'll<00:03:29.200> slow<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:30.040> down<00:03:30.069> for<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:31.500> check<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.680> out

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
I'll slow that down for you check it out

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.030 
I'll slow that down for you check it out
every<00:03:34.299> time<00:03:34.389> you<00:03:34.480> put<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.690> key<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.980> will

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
every time you put the key it will

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.090 
every time you put the key it will
ripple<00:03:36.579> out<00:03:36.730> just<00:03:37.660> like<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.079> this<00:03:38.500> one<00:03:38.799> when

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
ripple out just like this this one when

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.009 
ripple out just like this this one when
I<00:03:39.130> saw<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.850> was<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.030> I'm<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.660> using<00:03:40.870> a

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
I saw it I was like I'm not using a

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.830 
I saw it I was like I'm not using a
keyboard<00:03:41.200> without<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:42.160> anymore<00:03:42.720> ripple<00:03:43.720> out

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
keyboard without this anymore ripple out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.530 
keyboard without this anymore ripple out
that's<00:03:44.470> not<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.829> cool<00:03:45.160> bit<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.810> next<00:03:47.109> one<00:03:47.290> is

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that's not the cool bit the next one is

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.870 
that's not the cool bit the next one is
the<00:03:49.540> same<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.049> with<00:03:50.230> horizontal<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
the same but with horizontal with in the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.240 
the same but with horizontal with in the
horizontal<00:03:52.150> plane<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.989> i<00:03:53.230> usually<00:03:53.500> whoops

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
horizontal plane so i usually whoops

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.920 
horizontal plane so i usually whoops
wrong<00:03:54.340> one<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.730> usually<00:03:55.030> want<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.420> make<00:03:55.810> this

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
wrong one I usually want to make this

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.440 
wrong one I usually want to make this
really<00:03:56.139> fast<00:03:56.380> it's<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.920> do<00:03:57.450> something

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
really fast it's like to do something

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.379 
really fast it's like to do something
for<00:03:58.690> space<00:03:58.870> invaders<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.519> you<00:04:00.519> so<00:04:01.180> that's

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
for space invaders to you so that's

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.509 
for space invaders to you so that's
pretty<00:04:01.599> cool<00:04:01.690> as<00:04:01.930> well<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.410> let's<00:04:03.069> go<00:04:03.280> keep

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
pretty cool as well so let's go keep

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.210 
pretty cool as well so let's go keep
going<00:04:03.549> on<00:04:04.030> there<00:04:04.269> more<00:04:04.709> likely<00:04:05.709> modes<00:04:05.919> let's

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
going on there more likely modes let's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.539 
going on there more likely modes let's
go<00:04:06.370> another<00:04:07.180> one<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:08.069> this<00:04:09.069> is<00:04:09.190> actually<00:04:09.430> like

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
go another one is this is actually like

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.240 
go another one is this is actually like
a<00:04:09.700> motion

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
a motion

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.830 
a motion
so<00:04:10.520> there<00:04:10.820> are<00:04:10.940> no<00:04:11.090> more<00:04:11.240> lighting<00:04:11.510> modes

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
so there are no more lighting modes

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.670 
so there are no more lighting modes
everything<00:04:12.680> all<00:04:13.280> leads<00:04:13.790> are<00:04:14.000> off<00:04:14.380> but<00:04:15.380> one

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
everything all leads are off but one

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.349 
everything all leads are off but one
more<00:04:16.160> last<00:04:16.519> thing<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:16.940> can<00:04:16.970> do<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
more last thing you can do with the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.580 
more last thing you can do with the
light<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.109> actually<00:04:18.260> change

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
light is that you can actually change

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.729 
light is that you can actually change
the<00:04:18.950> color<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.150> space<00:04:20.359> bar<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:21.530> funny

the color of the space bar the funny

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.140 
the color of the space bar the funny
thing<00:04:21.829> is<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.760> be<00:04:22.880> operated

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
thing is it can be operated

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730 
thing is it can be operated
independently<00:04:23.510> from<00:04:23.990> any<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.440> these<00:04:24.560> other

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
independently from any of these other

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.820 
independently from any of these other
keys<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.420> look<00:04:26.660> at<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.810> here<00:04:27.320> now<00:04:27.620> it's

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
keys and if you look at it here now it's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.640 
keys and if you look at it here now it's
just<00:04:28.070> red<00:04:28.400> I'm<00:04:28.670> gonna<00:04:28.970> enable<00:04:29.540> switching<00:04:30.500> of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
just red I'm gonna enable switching of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.940 
just red I'm gonna enable switching of
the<00:04:31.190> space<00:04:31.700> bar<00:04:31.880> color<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.570> this<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.200> red<00:04:33.680> green

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
the space bar color so this is red green

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.240 
the space bar color so this is red green
blue<00:04:34.190> channel<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:35.510> know<00:04:35.690> colors<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.890> will

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
blue channel you know colors it will

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.250 
blue channel you know colors it will
increase<00:04:38.530> blue<00:04:39.530> here<00:04:40.300> green<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:41.930> just<00:04:42.110> going

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
increase blue here green I'm just going

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.900 
increase blue here green I'm just going
to<00:04:42.320> increase<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.890> so<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.220> becomes<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.520> bit<00:04:43.640> teal

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
to increase it so it becomes a bit teal

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.350 
to increase it so it becomes a bit teal
yeah<00:04:44.810> there<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.200> go<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.410> pull<00:04:46.280> up<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.490> rib<00:04:46.669> so

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
yeah there we go to pull up the rib so

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.820 
yeah there we go to pull up the rib so
if<00:04:47.450> you'd<00:04:47.570> want<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.870> think<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.290> what<00:04:48.440> color<00:04:48.650> you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
if you'd want to think of what color you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.710 
if you'd want to think of what color you
want<00:04:49.010> uh<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.669> guys<00:04:49.760> can<00:04:50.030> make<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.240> easy<00:04:50.419> and

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
want uh you guys can make it easy and

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.990 
want uh you guys can make it easy and
some<00:04:51.290> demo<00:04:51.470> demo<00:04:51.860> mode<00:04:52.130> where<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.790> will

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
some demo demo mode where it will

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.210 
some demo demo mode where it will
actually<00:04:53.770> cycle<00:04:54.770> through<00:04:54.919> some<00:04:55.070> of<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
actually cycle through some of the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.700 
actually cycle through some of the
colors<00:04:55.520> which<00:04:55.850> makes<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.600> really<00:04:56.990> different

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
colors which makes it really different

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.080 
colors which makes it really different
so<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.040> center<00:04:58.310> one<00:04:58.430> always<00:04:58.640> has<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:58.880> red

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
so the center one always has to be red

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.250 
so the center one always has to be red
but<00:04:59.270> the<00:05:00.020> sides<00:05:00.500> will<00:05:01.160> change<00:05:01.730> color<00:05:02.000> right<00:05:02.990> so

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
but the sides will change color right so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.409 
but the sides will change color right so
that's<00:05:03.470> all<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:04.970> stuff<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> can

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
that's all for the for the stuff you can

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.720 
that's all for the for the stuff you can
do<00:05:05.570> with<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.960> LEDs<00:05:06.350> I'm<00:05:06.500> sure<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.160> found<00:05:07.430> your

you know when you're gaming you don't

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.400 
you know when you're gaming you don't

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
of doing that in software but and I

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.450 
of doing that in software but and I
think<00:05:39.590> still<00:05:39.770> series<00:05:40.010> has<00:05:40.130> one<00:05:40.310> way

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
think still series has one way

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460 
think still series has one way
permanently<00:05:41.060> disables<00:05:41.479> anyway<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:41.960> ships<00:05:42.320> it

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
permanently disables anyway and ships it

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.740 
permanently disables anyway and ships it
over<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.800> side<00:05:43.010> but<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:44.210> gives<00:05:44.510> you<00:05:44.720> a

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
over to the side but this gives you a

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.159 
over to the side but this gives you a
jumper<00:05:45.410> option<00:05:45.860> of<00:05:46.070> to<00:05:46.970> enable<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.020> disable
