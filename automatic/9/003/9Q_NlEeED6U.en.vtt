00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
ported it to the PC and that's a little

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.429 
ported it to the PC and that's a little
mean<00:01:58.799> actually<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:03.150> because<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> cars<00:02:03.990> all

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
mean actually just because the cars all

mean actually just because the cars all
feels<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.460> many<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.760> them<00:02:05.880> should<00:02:06.090> feel

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
feels well many of them should feel

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.259 
feels well many of them should feel
similar<00:02:06.689> they're<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.470> bad<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.399> fact<00:02:08.939> I<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
dirt too more and grid one more but that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.710 
dirt too more and grid one more but that
doesn't<00:02:16.560> mean<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.010> isn't<00:02:17.640> any<00:02:17.970> less<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.599> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
doesn't mean this isn't any less of a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.019 
doesn't mean this isn't any less of a
game<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.609> doesn't<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.969> any

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:21.029 
game it's it just doesn't have any
