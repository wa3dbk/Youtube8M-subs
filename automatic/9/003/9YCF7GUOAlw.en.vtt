00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.950 
I just started hitting them off and I
came<00:01:52.940> up<00:01:53.000> with<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> melody<00:01:53.540> which<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:53.750> thought

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
came up with a melody which I thought

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.070 
came up with a melody which I thought
was<00:01:54.170> good<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.490> where<00:01:55.820> logic<00:01:56.210> pro<00:01:56.570> x<00:01:56.720> helps

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
was good this is where logic pro x helps

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.140 
was good this is where logic pro x helps
me<00:01:57.230> out<00:01:57.370> when<00:01:58.370> you're<00:01:58.490> using<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.820> software

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
me out when you're using a software

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.660 
me out when you're using a software
instrument<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.870> making<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.620> melody<00:02:00.950> let's<00:02:01.550> say

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
instrument and making a melody let's say

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.040 
instrument and making a melody let's say
you<00:02:01.760> just<00:02:01.970> make<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> good<00:02:02.420> melody<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:02.900> this

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
you just make a good melody but this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.140 
you just make a good melody but this
melody<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.500> not<00:02:03.680> in<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.920> same<00:02:04.490> key<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
melody is not in the same key and in the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.090 
melody is not in the same key and in the
right<00:02:05.330> chord<00:02:05.660> what<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.470> basically<00:02:06.680> do<00:02:07.070> is

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
right chord what you basically do is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.840 
right chord what you basically do is
open<00:02:07.700> up<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.300> your<00:02:08.539> MIDI<00:02:09.050> effects<00:02:09.530> section

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
something called transpose ax that's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680 
something called transpose ax that's
right<00:02:13.100> what<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.550> did<00:02:13.820> was<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.150> open<00:02:14.510> this

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
these notes to play exactly in the e-

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.780 
these notes to play exactly in the e-
scale<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.740> what<00:02:48.950> they<00:02:49.070> sound<00:02:49.310> like<00:02:49.400> after

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
scale this is what they sound like after

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.250 
scale this is what they sound like after
I<00:02:49.820> put<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.060> transposer<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.210> go<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
nice you just needed to get it in key

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.350 
nice you just needed to get it in key
instead<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.310> taking<00:03:04.610> every<00:03:04.910> note<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
instead of taking every note and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.840 
instead of taking every note and
adjusting<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.020> put<00:03:06.830> on<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.070> transposer<00:03:07.550> and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
adjusting it put on the transposer and

come<00:03:25.010> down<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> breakdown<00:03:25.670> where<00:03:25.850> we

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
come down to the breakdown where we

come down to the breakdown where we
introduces<00:03:26.570> melody<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.740> in<00:03:27.950> getting<00:03:28.250> deep
