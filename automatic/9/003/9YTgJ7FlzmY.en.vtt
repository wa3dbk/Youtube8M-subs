00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
so this is the new alienware area-51 so

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.240 
so this is the new alienware area-51 so
all<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.080> technologies<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.799> needs<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.070> talk

amazing piece of hardware but how would
we<00:02:08.560> design<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> triangle<00:02:09.459> with<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.840> triangle

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
we design a triangle with the triangle
