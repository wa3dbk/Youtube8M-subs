never been the same

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.289 
never been the same
solving<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:14.639> water-soluble

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
solving was the first water-soluble

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.990 
solving was the first water-soluble
topping<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.500> still<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> best<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.580> guess

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
topping and it's still the best I guess

way for removal well of course

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.859 
way for removal well of course
I<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.310> spray<00:01:44.640> bottle<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.540> part

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I like my spray bottle with one part

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
I like my spray bottle with one part
fabric<00:01:46.380> softener<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> twelve<00:01:47.610> parts<00:01:48.030> water

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
fabric softener and twelve parts water

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.690 
fabric softener and twelve parts water
because<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.100> dissolves<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> salty

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because that dissolves the salty

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.899 
because that dissolves the salty
instantly<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> leaves<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.290> nice<00:01:52.470> fresh<00:01:52.829> scent

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
instantly and leaves a nice fresh scent

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.959 
instantly and leaves a nice fresh scent
but<00:01:53.909> sometimes<00:01:54.899> their<00:01:55.259> fabrics<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.969> that

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
but sometimes their fabrics that that

then I'm moisten a q-tip and just dab
those<00:02:08.819> small<00:02:09.209> areas<00:02:09.479> where<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.619> bits<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.160> sabi

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

wonderful kiss Deborah how do you like
to<00:02:17.829> store<00:02:18.069> your<00:02:18.280> salty<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.939> important<00:02:19.540> I

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
to store your salty that's important I

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.080 
to store your salty that's important I
think<00:02:19.689> yes<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.650> because<00:02:20.920> solving<00:02:21.760> is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
think yes it is because solving is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.199 
think yes it is because solving is
obviously<00:02:22.840> sensitive<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> moisture<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
obviously sensitive to moisture and it

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.660 
obviously sensitive to moisture and it
can<00:02:25.359> also<00:02:25.510> dry<00:02:25.959> out<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.799> you<00:02:26.859> want<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.519> keep

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
can also dry out so you want to keep

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.819 
can also dry out so you want to keep
yourself<00:02:27.849> either<00:02:28.420> wrapped<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:29.049> plastic<00:02:29.319> or

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
yourself either wrapped in plastic or

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.740 
yourself either wrapped in plastic or
store<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.459> container<00:02:30.819> with<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.180> lid<00:02:31.480> until

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
store it in a container with a lid until

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.869 
store it in a container with a lid until
you're<00:02:32.019> ready<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.349> use<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.099> here's<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
selling tip related to solve e I keep a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.000 
selling tip related to solve e I keep a
sample<00:02:37.120> shirt<00:02:37.359> in<00:02:37.510> my<00:02:37.659> carry<00:02:37.959> bag<00:02:38.260> with<00:02:38.799> the
