00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.520 
involved with the xbox one process and
it<00:05:07.140> being<00:05:07.440> an<00:05:07.920> xbox<00:05:08.460> system<00:05:08.690> then<00:05:09.690> that's

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
it being an xbox system then that's

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.590 
it being an xbox system then that's
unfortunate<00:05:10.860> because<00:05:11.730> they<00:05:11.970> don't<00:05:12.210> want<00:05:12.510> to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
unfortunate because they don't want to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.660 
unfortunate because they don't want to
take<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.870> away<00:05:13.050> from<00:05:13.170> the<00:05:13.650> Xbox<00:05:14.040> users<00:05:14.460> they

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
take it away from the Xbox users they

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.280 
take it away from the Xbox users they
don't<00:05:14.850> think<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.180> xbox<00:05:15.750> users<00:05:15.990> should<00:05:16.170> be

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
don't think that xbox users should be

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.470 
don't think that xbox users should be
punished<00:05:16.620> necessarily<00:05:17.610> for<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.970> so<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.360> game

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
punished necessarily for it so the game

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.900 
punished necessarily for it so the game
will<00:05:18.660> be<00:05:18.750> coming<00:05:18.960> out<00:05:19.140> on<00:05:19.290> xbox<00:05:19.680> one<00:05:19.860> ps4<00:05:20.370> and

it it will only be on xbox one and it'll
only<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:29.250> because<00:05:29.760> Microsoft<00:05:30.720> insisted<00:05:31.380> on<00:05:31.470> it

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
only be because Microsoft insisted on it
