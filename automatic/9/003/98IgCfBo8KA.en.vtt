guess<00:03:48.610> in<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.630> way<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.780> transform<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.769> it's

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
guess in a way you transform this it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.080 
guess in a way you transform this it's
really<00:03:51.970> neat<00:03:52.239> unique<00:03:52.989> um<00:03:53.290> uh<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.850> is<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
really neat unique um uh this is a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.340 
really neat unique um uh this is a
buying<00:03:55.750> dragon<00:03:56.739> bear<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:59.170> monkey<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.120> turtle

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
so that was very good and has a screw on

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.300 
so that was very good and has a screw on
the<00:04:06.280> paper<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.500> was<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.830> power

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the paper and so that was the power

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.410 
the paper and so that was the power
range<00:04:09.519> Shriners<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.380> think<00:04:11.380> that's

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
range Shriners I think that's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.050 
range Shriners I think that's
