it right up to the surface there we go I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
it right up to the surface there we go I
took<00:01:33.479> both<00:01:33.750> threads<00:01:34.079> underneath<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:34.829> foot<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
took both threads underneath my foot and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
took both threads underneath my foot and
then<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.790> start<00:01:36.150> stitching<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.229> start<00:01:37.590> slow

times so that is the inside of the
spiral<00:04:14.430> knocked<00:04:15.300> out<00:04:15.570> I'm<00:04:15.870> shifting

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
spiral knocked out I'm shifting

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.170 
spiral knocked out I'm shifting
everything<00:04:16.799> around<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.519> I'm<00:04:17.580> gonna<00:04:17.700> back<00:04:18.000> up

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
so that's how we knock out one of our

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.990 
so that's how we knock out one of our
teardrop<00:05:38.170> motifs<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:39.160> wash<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.430> repeat

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.660 
them over the whole surface of the quilt
now<00:05:44.740> one<00:05:44.980> other<00:05:45.100> thing<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.430> might<00:05:45.610> be

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
wondering about what do we do with these

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.890 
wondering about what do we do with these
thread<00:05:48.100> tails<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:48.940> I'll<00:05:49.090> give<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.330> tips<00:05:49.630> on

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
thread tails so I'll give you tips on

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.270 
thread tails so I'll give you tips on
how<00:05:50.170> to<00:05:50.200> hide<00:05:50.530> those<00:05:50.800> next<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.320> every<00:05:53.800> time<00:05:54.040> we

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
how to hide those next so every time we

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.250 
how to hide those next so every time we
start<00:05:54.670> and<00:05:55.030> stop<00:05:55.330> stitching<00:05:55.900> we're<00:05:56.050> always

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
start and stop stitching we're always

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.470 
start and stop stitching we're always
going<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.620> end<00:05:56.770> up<00:05:56.950> with<00:05:57.070> loose<00:05:57.370> threads<00:05:57.820> now<00:05:58.450> a

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
going to end up with loose threads now a

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.270 
going to end up with loose threads now a
lot<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.840> quilters<00:05:59.260> like<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.560> just<00:05:59.740> build<00:06:00.040> up

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
lot of quilters like to just build up

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.640 
lot of quilters like to just build up
thread<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.880> clip<00:06:01.210> off<00:06:01.390> these<00:06:01.660> tails<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:02.290> don't

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
thread and clip off these tails I don't

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.840 
thread and clip off these tails I don't
like<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.860> do<00:06:02.980> it<00:06:03.070> that<00:06:03.130> way<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.370> just<00:06:03.460> don't

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
like to do it that way I just don't

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.720 
like to do it that way I just don't
think<00:06:04.030> it's<00:06:04.180> very<00:06:04.240> secure<00:06:04.780> so<00:06:05.650> instead<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.430> give

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
think it's very secure so instead I give

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.300 
think it's very secure so instead I give
that<00:06:06.940> top<00:06:07.210> thread<00:06:07.510> of<00:06:07.690> tug<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.290> that'll<00:06:09.190> that

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
that top thread of tug and that'll that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.700 
that top thread of tug and that'll that
brings<00:06:09.580> up<00:06:09.760> this<00:06:09.910> little<00:06:10.270> loop<00:06:10.570> can<00:06:11.440> take<00:06:11.680> a

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
brings up this little loop can take a

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.730 
brings up this little loop can take a
needle<00:06:12.010> and<00:06:12.400> pick<00:06:12.850> up<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.210> loop<00:06:13.480> and<00:06:13.780> that

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
needle and pick up that loop and that

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.560 
needle and pick up that loop and that
way<00:06:15.040> both<00:06:15.400> threads<00:06:15.760> will<00:06:16.000> be<00:06:16.120> brought<00:06:16.330> to<00:06:16.450> the

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
way both threads will be brought to the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
way both threads will be brought to the
surface<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.170> quilt

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
surface of the quilt

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.270 
surface of the quilt
now<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.370> tie<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:18.970> two<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.810> knot<00:06:20.080> it's<00:06:20.980> just<00:06:21.160> a

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
now I tie the two and a knot it's just a

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.340 
now I tie the two and a knot it's just a
simple<00:06:21.670> overhand<00:06:21.970> knot<00:06:22.270> make<00:06:22.720> a<00:06:22.750> loop<00:06:23.110> and

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
simple overhand knot make a loop and

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.370 
simple overhand knot make a loop and
bring<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.190> tails<00:06:24.430> through<00:06:25.180> that<00:06:25.390> loop<00:06:25.660> now

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
bring the tails through that loop now

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.440 
bring the tails through that loop now
here's<00:06:26.620> another<00:06:26.680> tip<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.550> don't<00:06:28.150> want<00:06:28.360> to

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
here's another tip you don't want to

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.500 
here's another tip you don't want to
bring<00:06:28.660> this<00:06:29.470> knot<00:06:29.770> all<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.400> way<00:06:30.520> down<00:06:30.820> to<00:06:31.360> the

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
bring this knot all the way down to the

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.240 
bring this knot all the way down to the
surface<00:06:32.170> of<00:06:32.350> the<00:06:32.470> quilt<00:06:32.710> you<00:06:32.830> want<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.130> bring

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
surface of the quilt you want to bring

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.640 
surface of the quilt you want to bring
it<00:06:33.370> about<00:06:33.520> an<00:06:33.670> eighth<00:06:33.910> of<00:06:34.090> an<00:06:34.240> inch<00:06:34.360> and<00:06:34.810> that's

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
it about an eighth of an inch and that's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.680 
it about an eighth of an inch and that's
because<00:06:36.400> if<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:36.910> bring<00:06:37.150> it<00:06:37.270> all<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.390> way<00:06:37.480> down

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
because if you bring it all the way down

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.930 
because if you bring it all the way down
it<00:06:37.840> really<00:06:38.140> likes<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:38.830> set<00:06:39.100> on<00:06:39.250> this<00:06:39.370> surface

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
it really likes to set on this surface
