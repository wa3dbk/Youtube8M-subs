00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.630
 it is considered that tillers 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.790
 This is a seasonal technique and its main 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.660
 the functionality it performs first in spring and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.960
 until late autumn 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.240
 and then with the motoblock it merges fuel 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 he washes this is a deserved winter level 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.669
 rest in truth is not really 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.099
 so in winter, tillers can also 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.550
 operated in most cases 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.140
 with their help, there is no cleaning and today we 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.140
 still consider one of these tips 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.550
 but in order for your walker to be secure 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.170
 worked in the winter time is necessary 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.850
 comply with the conditions for its storage 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.649
 that is, the technique must be in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.390
 heated room and not exposed 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.390
 negative temperatures 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 due to exposure to low temperatures 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.460
 the breather tube may be frozen 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.589
 and the air filters accumulate and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.659
 freeze condensate in this case the risk 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.979
 engine breakdowns are extremely large also for 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.960
 work in winter 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.110
 It is necessary to replace the engine oil with 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.369
 summer to winter and now let's 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.509
 go out of town to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.509
 continue the review went 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 so we came out of town to 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.220
 in field conditions try as 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.729
 walking caiman vario land with him 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.670
 equipment 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.060
 We previously filled the winter photoblog 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.220
 oil according to specification 530 and equipped 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 its additional locks 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.280
 differentials 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.290
 as you can see before 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.580
 shooting we already had to take advantage 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.900
 the caiman vario motor -block with a hinge plate for 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.060
 order to make their way home 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.830
 let's learn more about this 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.400
 walking tractor this walker caiman vario 60 with 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.769
 production france 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.470
 walking tractor equipped with a Japanese engine 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.239
 6 horsepower subaru has 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.160
 two forward gears and one gear 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.140
 backwards 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.670
 walking tractor is designed to work on 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.110
 plots of land up to two 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.150
 half thousand square meters 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.100
 powerful aggressive wheel protector 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 installed on walk-behind tractor designed to 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.810
 It works both in winter and summer, walk-behind tractor 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.549
 equipped with a collapsible color gear 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.590
 lifelong lubrication and provide 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.390
 minimum output power loss 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.299
 comfortable elliptical handle 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 Adjustable four planes and easy 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.940
 set up a walk-behind tractor 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.489
 caiman vario is equipped with innovative 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
 gear box 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.620
 joint development of the factory pubert and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.459
 one of the leading french 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.260
 automakers drive mounted 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.850
 equipment of the motor-block is carried out 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.209
 using an external pulley 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.380
 installed on the motor-shaft 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.720
 additionally differentials that we 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.120
 installed on walker allow with 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.019
 ease on the spot deploy enough 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.850
 heavy car weight tiller along with 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.220
 installed on wesg aibolit 110 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.100
 kilogram and now let's consider 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.170
 mounted on the motoblock 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.810
 Rotary snow dura-ace target width 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.440
 Capture 60 centimeters and with height 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.680
 Capture of 25 centimeters of snow to 1 1 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.850
 cascade and auger driven 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.850
 at the expense of the belt 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.849
 snow control throwing manual 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.609
 carried out with the help of these 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.530
 levers choose the side where you will 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.900
 throwing snow and using this 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.900
 leverage control height get out a 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:12.849
 now let's try this block with 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:15.250
 nozzle in the work of the plant motoblock itself 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.269
 temperature makes it work a little 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.269
 idle ceiling 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.120
 our order is ready to work 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.010
 elevation of fresh snow released to 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.010
 10 meters 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.980
 as you see no high enough 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.780
 but our motoblock wave with not cope 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.520
 for greater efficiency of course better 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.330
 all of it additionally and demolish yet 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.330
 weighting 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:53.379
 so we finished work on the tillers 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:54.819
 now we will clear it from snow and we will put 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.639
 for storage in heated rooms 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:00.990
 then the technique will serve you for a long time and not 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.990
 let you down neither in winter nor in summer 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.220
 data much more equipment with 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.400
 full warranty technical support 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.700
 You can buy in the company Unis 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.040
