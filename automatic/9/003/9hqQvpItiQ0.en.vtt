 special tea blend for 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.700
 making tea in one little and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 local tradition the beginning of which 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 put smugglers who live 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.450
 lived on the border between holland and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 Germany in the area which is called 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 eastern pension for making this 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 tea we need a few tricks 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.350
 trick first special composition like 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.340
 rule such a blend is made up of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.710
 Indian teas 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 because of itself and even with dominant a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 this mixture itself is small because tea 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 must brew very hard why 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 you will understand a bit later the secret of the second 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 this tea must be insisted on 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 candle he must brew not only 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 hard but constantly be very hot 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 otherwise, the main sound will not work. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.600
 the effect of this tea while our tea 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 brews and turns out very, very 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.729
 East Friske I will say a few words about 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 local tea traditions in general 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.540
 the main charm of tea culture is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 in that it can be localized 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 gift from each family 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 I learned from my father to drink tea and principle 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 with these tea parties which were not 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 some kind of solemn and especially mine 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 just accompanied and sometimes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.860
 sometimes interesting to tell 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 remarks who should drink tea 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
 started my interest in tea tea culture 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.759
 In general, in every Russian family they drink tea 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.619
 in its own way but this is not a feature of ours 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.320
 countries in any normal tea country 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.479
 everything is just the same small 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 local tradition she is always very 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.189
 interesting because it allows you to pull out 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 some elements of tea culture 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.530
 associated with life associated with small 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.509
 cities with little villages and things and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 by the way 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.680
 interesting that when such cultures 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 sanded you refined from them 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 get out quite unexpectedly sometimes 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.180
 very faddish things at one time 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.019
 it was friske tea that struck me that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 it prizes that are usually in tea 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.269
 are irrelevant external sound 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.579
 kind of unexpected effects and stuff stuff 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.870
 Other what's the secret 3 through phrases 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.049
 whom tea is very simple 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.150
 we need very very hot tea why 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.650
 the frieze needs very hot tea 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750
 in order to cracked the garden 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.849
 if the tea is not hot enough 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
 only historical saccharin those who 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.939
 cutters throw in their tea will not 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.980
 explode 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.870
 and if it is hot everything clicks like 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.090
 it is necessary and here comes the first 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.639
 erotic moment we throw a piece 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
 sugar and it clicks the bigger the sugar 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.650
 the more we sat down we throw another and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.139
 sugar clicks again we throw 3 and he 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.269
 again it clicks sometimes cracks but it is still 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.859
 not all the cutter turned out to be people who 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 generally like visual effects and 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.629
 so they neatly neatly 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.939
 the very edge of the cup is added to this 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.680
 tea cream or milk cream is best at 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.180
 my hands are shaking can not be me 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.810
 get as good as it gets 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.299
 for the friezes, but the less the fact is that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.319
 cream sinking to the bottom afterwards 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.260
 go up 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.389
 any spiers some obscure 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.159
 figures eventually form on 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.019
 cup surface marble drawing 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.019
 happy you can add a little more 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.790
 then there will be more marble in tea 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.810
 here the main effect is what the cream 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.209
 sink to the bottom 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.010
 trickle and then rise from the middle 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 it's very interesting to watch 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.930
 Second from about to about to about to go that ta ta in 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.389
 I have never been able to but also this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.090
 not the thing is that friske tea is not 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.400
 he is stirred here in this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.810
 completely incomprehensible state not 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.459
 just because it's interesting to him 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.560
 look but also because its 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.879
 interesting to drink if you do not forget we 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.919
 sugar is thrown into it 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.259
 crystalline which is very slow 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.659
 dissolves and when we drink 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.459
 such tea is not stirred at first we 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.470
 drink a few sips of tea 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.389
 unsweetened then he gets a little bit 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.599
 sweeter and finally at the very end 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.979
 practically sugar syrup turns 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.409
 Friesian tea drinking consists of several 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:16.229
 very interesting stages first with us 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.909
 very hot tea sugar cracks then we 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.340
 add with visual effects there 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.659
 cream and milk and finally we drink tea and 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.040
 wonder how gradually 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.840
 its taste changes 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.840
 from not very sweet to very sweet 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.470
 strong frisky tea already with milk already 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.180
 very hot 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.180
 still not sweet tea see you
