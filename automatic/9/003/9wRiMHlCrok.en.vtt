lengthening in my previous tapes the
only<00:00:37.110> change<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.559> might<00:00:37.770> make<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

only change I might make is that in the
shoulder<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> sit<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.829> look

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
shoulder in I like to sit and look

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
shoulder in I like to sit and look
straight<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.640> alongside<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> makes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
straight down alongside and that makes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.830 
straight down alongside and that makes
it<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> achieve<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it easy for me to achieve the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
it easy for me to achieve the
straightness<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> medium<00:00:47.010> trial<00:00:47.450> here's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
straightness in the medium trial here's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
straightness in the medium trial here's
too<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.809> angle<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.280> reins<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.700> too

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
too much angle here my reins are too

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
too much angle here my reins are too
long<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.480> lose<00:00:51.809> control<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> haunches<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
long I lose control of the haunches I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
long I lose control of the haunches I
need<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.059> abrupt<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.989> strength

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
need to be abrupt in my strength

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
need to be abrupt in my strength
straightening<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> lengthening

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
straightening so that the lengthening

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
straightening so that the lengthening
has

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
has

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.399 
has
I'm<00:01:00.390> even<00:01:00.930> different<00:01:01.290> level<00:01:01.680> steps

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.770 

here<00:01:09.409> is<00:01:09.530> loss<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.950> rhythm<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.640> use<00:01:11.180> way<00:01:11.750> too

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
here is loss of rhythm I use way too

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.620 
here is loss of rhythm I use way too
much<00:01:12.259> leg<00:01:12.799> my<00:01:13.310> horse<00:01:13.640> Cantor's<00:01:14.090> because<00:01:14.450> he
