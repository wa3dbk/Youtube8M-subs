00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.590 

we'll<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> find<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.950> real<00:02:02.100> fast<00:02:02.369> left<00:02:02.670> set<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
we'll just find a real fast left set the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600 
we'll just find a real fast left set the
pattern<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.020> shut<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.469> switch<00:02:04.770> off<00:02:04.979> go

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
pattern you like shut the switch off go

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.650 
pattern you like shut the switch off go
to<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.670> hit<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:08.940> momentary<00:02:09.479> but

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to right you and hit them momentary but

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.240 
to right you and hit them momentary but
until<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> find<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> pattern<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.619> shut

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
until you find the pattern you like shut

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
until you find the pattern you like shut
the<00:02:11.310> switch<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.569> at<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> center<00:02:12.959> out

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the switch off but at the center out

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.120 
the switch off but at the center out
which<00:02:13.800> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
which is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.850

again<00:02:16.860> touch<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> flash<00:02:17.640> pattern<00:02:18.380> find<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
again touch the flash pattern find the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.600 
again touch the flash pattern find the
pattern<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:19.920> best

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
