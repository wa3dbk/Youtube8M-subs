or<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.350> behaves<00:00:25.980> differently<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> have

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
or just behaves differently so I have

pictures<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.850> won't<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.180> into

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
pictures all of that so I won't go into

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
pictures all of that so I won't go into
too<00:00:42.420> much<00:00:42.600> detail<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> why<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.920> this

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
too much detail as to why I like this

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.549 
too much detail as to why I like this
but<00:00:44.280> essentially<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.210> performs<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.379> has

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
but essentially it performs all it has

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
but essentially it performs all it has
all<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.399> properties<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.149> just

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
all of these same properties that I just

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
all of these same properties that I just
talked<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.719> loving<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> foundation<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
talked about loving in a foundation the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
talked about loving in a foundation the
somewhat<00:00:50.969> mattifying<00:00:51.539> effect<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.739> full

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
somewhat mattifying effect the more full

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.069 
somewhat mattifying effect the more full
coverage<00:00:53.070> effect<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> yet<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> three<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
coverage effect and yet this is three to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
coverage effect and yet this is three to
four<00:00:55.230> dollars<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.860> two<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> made

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
four dollars of two so really it made

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
four dollars of two so really it made
the<00:00:57.420> top<00:00:57.600> 5<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.710> easily<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> most

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the top 5 because it is easily the most

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
the top 5 because it is easily the most
affordable<00:00:59.820> foundation<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> talk

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
affordable foundation I'm going to talk

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
affordable foundation I'm going to talk
about<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> 5<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.850> mention<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
about of the 5 I'm going to mention in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
about of the 5 I'm going to mention in
this<00:01:03.270> video<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:04.049> next<00:01:04.350> foundation<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.890> find

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this video this next foundation I find

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
this video this next foundation I find
to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> most<00:01:05.430> versatile<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to be the most versatile and it's the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
to be the most versatile and it's the
L'Oreal<00:01:06.960> True<00:01:07.290> Match<00:01:07.320> super<00:01:08.010> blendable

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
L'Oreal True Match super blendable

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
L'Oreal True Match super blendable
foundation<00:01:09.000> again<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> same<00:01:10.320> kind

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
foundation again it has that same kind

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.100 
foundation again it has that same kind
of<00:01:10.890> semi<00:01:11.280> matte<00:01:11.760> finish<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.420> dewy<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of semi matte finish not dewy in the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.719 
of semi matte finish not dewy in the
least<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> wouldn't<00:01:13.740> say<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.520> most

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
least I wouldn't say but it's most

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
least I wouldn't say but it's most
versatile<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.689> find<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> easiest<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
versatile because I find it easiest to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
versatile because I find it easiest to
layer<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.460> apply<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> thin<00:01:18.150> layer<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
layer I can apply a thin layer and it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690 
layer I can apply a thin layer and it
provides<00:01:19.080> light<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> medium<00:01:19.890> coverage<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
provides light to medium coverage and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
provides light to medium coverage and
yet<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.600> still<00:01:21.869> layer<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> build<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
yet I can still layer it and build it to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
yet I can still layer it and build it to
create<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> somewhat<00:01:23.850> heavier<00:01:24.180> coverage<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
create a somewhat heavier coverage and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.330 
create a somewhat heavier coverage and
it<00:01:24.810> doesn't<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.229> cakey<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.890> doesn't<00:01:26.189> look

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it doesn't get cakey it doesn't look

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
it doesn't get cakey it doesn't look
unnatural<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.450> when<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.689> traveling<00:01:28.170> this

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
unnatural so when I'm traveling this

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
unnatural so when I'm traveling this
will<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.920> go-to<00:01:29.130> foundation<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
will be my go-to foundation because it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
Lumi healthy luminous makeup and I
thought<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.140> important<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> add<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
thought it was important to add this in

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
thought it was important to add this in
here<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:48.090> anyone<00:01:48.570> else<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.020> like

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
here because like anyone else I do like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
here because like anyone else I do like
to<00:01:49.380> change<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> finish<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to change up the kind of finish that I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.789 
to change up the kind of finish that I
have<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.509> makeup<00:01:51.750> somedays<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.590> need

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
have with my makeup somedays I just need

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.889 
have with my makeup somedays I just need
a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.040> bit<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.549> extra<00:01:54.060> help<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.720> comes

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
a little bit of extra help when it comes

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
a little bit of extra help when it comes
to<00:01:55.020> getting<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> lit-from-within<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to getting that lit-from-within look and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
to getting that lit-from-within look and
so<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.689> dewy<00:01:57.960> makeup

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so I will go for a more dewy makeup

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
so I will go for a more dewy makeup
despite<00:01:58.950> generally<00:01:59.939> leaning<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.390> towards

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
despite generally leaning more towards

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.510 
despite generally leaning more towards
the<00:02:00.899> semi<00:02:01.140> matte<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.590> matte<00:02:01.799> finishes<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the semi matte to matte finishes and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.600 
the semi matte to matte finishes and
this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
this is what I go for because I know

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
this is what I go for because I know
it<00:02:04.850> doesn't<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> does<00:02:05.600> develop<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:06.140> little<00:02:06.410> bit

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
it doesn't it does develop a little bit

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.200 
it doesn't it does develop a little bit
more<00:02:06.680> doing<00:02:06.980> this<00:02:07.070> throughout<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.550> day<00:02:07.580> but
