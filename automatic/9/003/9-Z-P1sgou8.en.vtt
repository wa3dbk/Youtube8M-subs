the Hobby sets that Lego made there in

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.519 
the Hobby sets that Lego made there in
the<00:00:22.010> mid<00:00:22.160> 70s<00:00:22.730> they<00:00:23.360> had<00:00:23.540> different<00:00:23.779> vehicles

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
the mid 70s they had different vehicles

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.190 
the mid 70s they had different vehicles
motorcycles<00:00:24.950> cars<00:00:25.550> even<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.600> train<00:00:26.840> locomotive

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
motorcycles cars even a train locomotive

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.470 
motorcycles cars even a train locomotive
and<00:00:27.710> they<00:00:28.640> had<00:00:29.110> customized<00:00:30.110> stickers<00:00:30.770> and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
they were like models for display I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.180 
they were like models for display I
think<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:34.940> was<00:00:35.150> an<00:00:35.449> early<00:00:35.750> attempt<00:00:36.230> by<00:00:36.739> Lego

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
think this was an early attempt by Lego

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.240 
think this was an early attempt by Lego
to<00:00:37.250> appeal<00:00:37.699> to<00:00:37.730> older<00:00:38.830> youths<00:00:39.830> maybe

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250

white axles instead of the black that
you<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.710> today

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and these axle holders are a little

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.429 
and these axle holders are a little
different<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:50.540> one<00:01:51.280> here<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.900> is<00:01:57.140> one<00:01:57.320> of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
different so you one here this is one of

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.569 
different so you one here this is one of
the<00:01:58.119> one<00:01:59.119> by<00:01:59.299> twos<00:01:59.600> with<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.079> whole<00:02:00.320> epic<00:02:01.250> groove

the one by twos with a whole epic groove

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.880

on<00:02:02.000> either<00:02:02.119> side<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.619> these<00:02:03.829> are

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
on either side of it and then these are

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.420 
on either side of it and then these are
the<00:02:04.070> gray<00:02:04.430> ones<00:02:05.470> being<00:02:06.470> put<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.829> axles<00:02:07.189> in<00:02:07.340> a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
the gray ones being put the axles in a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.300 
the gray ones being put the axles in a
variety<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.880> ways<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.649> were<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:09.979> early

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
variety of ways so these were the early

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330 
variety of ways so these were the early
versions<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.239> Technic<00:02:11.660> pieces<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:13.130> by

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340

a FLH 1200 I guess is the type of
motorcycle<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.959> FLH<00:03:57.590> 1200<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.200> then<00:04:00.410> you

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
motorcycle it is FLH 1200 and then you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.370 
motorcycle it is FLH 1200 and then you
can<00:04:00.650> put<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.010> inside<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:02.060> box<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:06.260> then

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
can put this inside the box so and then

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.810 
can put this inside the box so and then

than the wheels today it's designed for

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.340 
than the wheels today it's designed for

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
one of these a gear to fit inside it got

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.450 
one of these a gear to fit inside it got
little<00:06:37.350> things<00:06:37.380> and<00:06:37.740> there's<00:06:38.040> kind<00:06:38.280> of<00:06:38.340> a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
little things and there's kind of a

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.430 
little things and there's kind of a
trick<00:06:38.670> tricky<00:06:39.600> to<00:06:39.720> get<00:06:39.810> these<00:06:39.960> things<00:06:40.260> on

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
trick tricky to get these things on

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.520 
trick tricky to get these things on
there<00:06:43.520> it's<00:06:44.520> too<00:06:44.670> much<00:06:44.820> work<00:06:45.000> for<00:06:45.060> me<00:06:45.300> no<00:06:46.290> hard

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
there it's too much work for me no hard

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.100 
there it's too much work for me no hard
time<00:06:46.680> getting<00:06:46.950> the<00:06:47.010> other<00:06:47.160> ones<00:06:47.310> on<00:06:47.490> this<00:06:48.110> to

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
time getting the other ones on this to

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.800 
time getting the other ones on this to
hold<00:06:49.320> the<00:06:49.470> gear<00:06:49.770> so<00:06:50.670> that's<00:06:51.330> a<00:06:51.570> little

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
hold the gear so that's a little

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.750 
hold the gear so that's a little
different<00:06:51.990> building<00:06:52.500> what<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.710> have<00:06:52.860> so<00:06:53.130> the

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
different building what you have so the
