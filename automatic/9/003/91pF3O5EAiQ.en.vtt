00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
get something that is ultra flat we're

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.630 
get something that is ultra flat we're
as<00:02:27.989> close<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.350> flat<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.799> possible<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.549> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
as close to flat is possible for the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.729 
as close to flat is possible for the
finish<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.510> doesn't<00:02:30.870> shine<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> really

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
finish it doesn't shine and it really

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.680 
finish it doesn't shine and it really
keeps<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.370> when<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> Sun<00:02:33.120> shines<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
keeps the when the Sun shines on it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
keeps the when the Sun shines on it
keeps<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.350> being<00:02:34.410> revealed<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
keeps it from being revealed so it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
keeps it from being revealed so it
maintains<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:36.150> camel<00:02:36.510> okay<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.049> got<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
maintains your camel okay so we got the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.490 
maintains your camel okay so we got the
base<00:02:37.590> coat<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:38.070> nice<00:02:38.640> thick<00:02:38.940> brown<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
base coat on nice thick brown and the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
base coat on nice thick brown and the
thicker<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.799> put<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.940> longer

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
thicker you put this on here the longer

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.300 
thicker you put this on here the longer
it's<00:02:42.480> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.629> take<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> dry<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.800> tend<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's going to take to dry so I tend to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
it's going to take to dry so I tend to
go<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:45.030> light<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.569> first<00:02:45.840> coat<00:02:46.080> but

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
go pretty light with that first coat but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.750 
go pretty light with that first coat but
enough<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> make<00:02:46.920> sure<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.489> get

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
enough to make sure that you really get

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.660 
enough to make sure that you really get
good<00:02:47.849> solid<00:02:48.500> coverage<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:50.099> all<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
good solid coverage of all of the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.059 
good solid coverage of all of the
surfaces<00:02:50.879> once<00:02:51.870> your<00:02:52.019> base<00:02:52.170> coat<00:02:52.379> is<00:02:52.530> dry<00:02:52.769> what

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
surfaces once your base coat is dry what

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.470 
surfaces once your base coat is dry what
you<00:02:53.159> got<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.459> get<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:53.819> camo<00:02:54.060> pattern

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
you got to do is get your camo pattern

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.380 
you got to do is get your camo pattern
so<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.079> can<00:02:55.349> get<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.829> custom-made<00:02:56.390> camel

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
so you can get a custom-made camel

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.970 
so you can get a custom-made camel
pattern<00:02:57.659> off<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> internet<00:02:58.319> or<00:02:58.620> print<00:02:58.860> make

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
pattern off the internet or print make

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.520 
pattern off the internet or print make
one<00:02:59.159> up<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.900> whatever<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> mean<00:03:01.409> I<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
I got some leaves here and we're going

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.819 
I got some leaves here and we're going
to<00:03:06.030> spray<00:03:06.450> paint<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.750> stage<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.230> camo<00:03:07.440> pattern

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
to spray paint a stage the camo pattern

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.440 
to spray paint a stage the camo pattern
looks<00:03:08.310> something<00:03:08.459> like<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.640> I've<00:03:09.030> sprayed

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
looks something like this I've sprayed

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.130 
looks something like this I've sprayed
with<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.500> flat<00:03:10.980> krylon<00:03:11.610> green<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.329> then<00:03:13.019> when

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
with a flat krylon green and then when

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.110 
with a flat krylon green and then when
you<00:03:13.230> pull<00:03:13.260> off<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:14.040> product<00:03:14.670> you're<00:03:14.909> left

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
you pull off your product you're left

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
you pull off your product you're left
with<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.390> color<00:03:15.629> underneath<00:03:16.189> okay<00:03:17.189> so

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
with that color underneath okay so

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
with that color underneath okay so
that's<00:03:17.579> basically<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.060> concept<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.659> we're

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
that's basically the concept that we're

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.039 
that's basically the concept that we're
going<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.640> when<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.239> do<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.840> next

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
going for so when I do this the next

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.440 
going for so when I do this the next
step<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.409> go<00:03:22.680> find<00:03:22.980> some<00:03:23.220> other<00:03:23.250> stuff<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:24.329> do

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
step I go find some other stuff to do

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420 
step I go find some other stuff to do
