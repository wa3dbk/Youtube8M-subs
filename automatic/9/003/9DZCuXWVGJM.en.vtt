00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
all these menus like all these different

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.430 
all these menus like all these different
menus<00:04:47.210> right<00:04:47.360> here<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.690> can<00:04:47.840> do<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> ton<00:04:48.410> of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
menus right here you can do a ton of

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.670 
menus right here you can do a ton of
different<00:04:48.680> stuff<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.640> I<00:04:50.360> think<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.810> multi

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
different stuff and I think this multi

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.409 
different stuff and I think this multi
mod<00:04:51.950> menu<00:04:52.190> is<00:04:52.430> good<00:04:52.669> because<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.300> have

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
mod menu is good because you have

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.380 
mod menu is good because you have
multiple<00:04:53.840> menus<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.830> don't<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.160> to

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
multiple menus and you don't have to

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.909 
multiple menus and you don't have to
switch<00:04:56.390> them<00:04:56.570> out<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.930> everything<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.620> it's

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
switch them out and everything and it's

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.550 
switch them out and everything and it's
just<00:04:58.160> way<00:04:58.820> more<00:04:58.850> convenient<00:04:59.600> and<00:04:59.930> stuff<00:05:00.289> and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
just way more convenient and stuff and

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.830 
just way more convenient and stuff and
just<00:05:01.160> showing<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.640> recon<00:05:02.240> plane<00:05:02.539> works

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
just showing you that recon plane works

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.760 
just showing you that recon plane works
right<00:05:03.050> there

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
right there

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.469 
right there
and<00:05:03.889> so<00:05:04.759> this<00:05:05.300> is<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.720> silent<00:05:06.229> assassin<00:05:06.979> menu

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
and so this is the silent assassin menu

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.400 
and so this is the silent assassin menu
say<00:05:08.479> as<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:08.690> can<00:05:08.810> see<00:05:08.930> right<00:05:08.960> there<00:05:09.259> it's

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
say as you can see right there it's

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.029 
say as you can see right there it's
silent<00:05:09.830> assassin<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.629> go<00:05:11.810> back<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.680> all
