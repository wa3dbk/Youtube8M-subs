unfortunately we lost we could say

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.900 
unfortunately we lost we could say
crucial<00:01:17.720> times<00:01:17.959> they've<00:01:18.259> it<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:19.490> gave<00:01:19.700> us

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
crucial times they've it that gave us

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.850 
crucial times they've it that gave us
the<00:01:20.539> idea<00:01:20.569> that<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:21.080> need<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.380> do<00:01:21.560> sort<00:01:21.830> of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
the idea that we need to do sort of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.620 
the idea that we need to do sort of
recoup<00:01:22.220> through<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.580> it'll<00:01:22.729> p<00:01:22.940> didn't<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.390> try

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
recoup through it it'll p didn't and try

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
recoup through it it'll p didn't and try
and<00:01:23.690> take<00:01:23.929> it<00:01:23.959> as<00:01:24.110> deep<00:01:24.289> as<00:01:24.440> possible<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:26.000> try

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and take it as deep as possible and try

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.169 
and take it as deep as possible and try
and<00:01:26.360> capitalize<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.080> last<00:01:27.289> five<00:01:27.470> hours

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
and capitalize in the last five hours

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.669 
and capitalize in the last five hours
yeah<00:01:29.179> like<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.509> said<00:01:29.690> I<00:01:29.720> mean<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:30.110> something

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
yeah like I said I mean it's something

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.740 
yeah like I said I mean it's something
we<00:01:30.800> can<00:01:31.009> definitely<00:01:31.220> assist<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.240> see<00:01:32.420> what<00:01:32.630> is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
we can definitely assist and see what is

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.350 
we can definitely assist and see what is
the<00:01:32.840> best<00:01:33.020> combinations<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.849> go<00:01:34.970> forward

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the best combinations to to go forward

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.719 
the best combinations to to go forward
it's<00:01:35.509> like<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.590> said<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:37.069> couple<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.429> days<00:01:37.550> ago

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729

it's it's a fresh deep so we're trying
to<00:01:40.039> figure<00:01:40.130> out<00:01:40.369> combinations<00:01:41.000> that's<00:01:41.209> going

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
to figure out combinations that's going

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.690 
to figure out combinations that's going
to<00:01:41.450> work<00:01:41.569> in<00:01:41.780> these<00:01:41.869> conditions<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.950> draw

experience<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:56.690> I've<00:02:56.780> seen

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
experience for you you know I've seen

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.080 
experience for you you know I've seen
him<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.920> couple<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.220> practice<00:02:58.610> matches<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
him in a couple of practice matches and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.480 
him in a couple of practice matches and
it's<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.300> great<00:02:59.480> either<00:02:59.690> great<00:02:59.990> prospect<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.680> I

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
it's a great either great prospect and I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.830 
it's a great either great prospect and I
think<00:03:01.850> he's<00:03:02.000> gonna<00:03:02.090> go<00:03:02.300> from<00:03:02.480> strength<00:03:02.780> to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
think he's gonna go from strength to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.949 
think he's gonna go from strength to
strength<00:03:02.960> especially<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:03.950> idea<00:03:04.959> look

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
strength especially in this idea look

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.290 
strength especially in this idea look
it's<00:03:06.110> gonna<00:03:06.400> have<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.520> assess<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.940> game<00:03:08.120> by

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
it's gonna have to assess it game by

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.760 
it's gonna have to assess it game by
game<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.720> see<00:03:08.870> what<00:03:09.080> are<00:03:09.200> what<00:03:09.530> are<00:03:09.560> our

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
game and see what are what are our

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.520 
game and see what are what are our
strategies<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.640> terms<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.840> conditions<00:03:12.380> we

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
strategies in terms of the conditions we

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.740 
strategies in terms of the conditions we
can<00:03:12.620> efface<00:03:12.890> like<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.000> mentioned<00:03:14.209> earlier<00:03:14.420> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
can efface like I mentioned earlier I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.260 
can efface like I mentioned earlier I
mean<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.140> very<00:03:15.770> different<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.280> what<00:03:16.489> what

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
mean this is very different to what what

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.090 
mean this is very different to what what
the<00:03:17.450> normal<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.110> your<00:03:18.290> night<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
the normal is that your night and the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.610 
the normal is that your night and the
norm<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.520> terms<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.910> Indian<00:03:20.270> pitches<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:21.500> is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
norm in terms of Indian pitches this is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.920 
norm in terms of Indian pitches this is
probably<00:03:21.890> more<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.489> it's<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:23.030> tintype<00:03:23.420> fuel<00:03:23.750> of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
probably more but it's a tintype fuel of

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.080 
probably more but it's a tintype fuel of
over<00:03:24.260> weekend<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.800> new<00:03:25.070> new<00:03:25.459> surface<00:03:25.910> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
over weekend it is a new new surface so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.120 
over weekend it is a new new surface so
