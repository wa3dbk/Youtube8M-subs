00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.990
 good I present you a little helmet that 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.510
 I bought on ebay 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.700
 it's a little press that his daughter and 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.380
 I enjoyed this headphone because 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.080
 that ultimately account for all 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.930
 case what you can see on the internet 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.940
 wireless the little adapter that's here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.920
 is really not taller I would say 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.210
 even he is even smaller than a 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:38.620
 lighter to give you an example there 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:41.800
 adapt killer the brick and go so 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.129
 really takes no place at all 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.649
 now this adapter goes on the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.940
 detector or elsewhere of course but 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.730
 it's convenient for those who do not have 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.860
 the means to buy at deus because 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.649
 it's good it's true it's 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 equipped with a wireless sensor 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.360
 but the country still remains 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.560
 alas this one what is funny is 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.729
 that his cat system looks like 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.689
 strongly to that of the deus ie 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:18.670
 you have a USB jack on which at 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.340
 fx tip and small breezes 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 this one plug into the adapter 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 who is here on the boulin 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:40.770
 and on the helmet it's here could see 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.570
 it's the brand equipped with a button for 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 decrease and increase the volume 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.399
 it is to make a focus here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 you can go down to the volume 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.780
 excuse me the headphones are 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 foldable which is not bad it does not 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.069
 do not take care in place good that's 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.039
 pity that it is not foldable thoroughly 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.100
 we will still gain space but I 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.500
 think we can not ask too much 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.370
 his autonomy then he has to be he 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 charged he has an autonomy of pretty much 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 I have more or less eight hours games that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.600
 is not bad 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 so he is delivered the charging cord a 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.209
 cord in case it would be more than enough 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.390
 responsible for putting live then 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.660
 I did not look at the length exactly 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.079
 I unfold it to see I want to make 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 small and a cigarette lighter charger 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.540
 which is not bad either because 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 while we make a broken pass 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 crust and ben we can put it back in 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.810
 charge that we fills him who gets 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.870
 fills and the cable is normal is going 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.420
 near 1 m it's a bit limited but they 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 sell extensions in the trade 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.030
 so I did a test this morning when 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.730
 I received them I want to go 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.510
 look for the abalone detector g1 g2 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.920
 or after us I'll take both 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.920
 years at least see with both 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 detectors 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:40.340
 the premium that g2 and the install both 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:51.010
 band 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:56.960
 we will start with housing two so 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:02.540
 you plug the small adapter on 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.330
 small adapter on the detector alice 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.930
 branch alone 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:12.040
 you put it together or that you 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.420
 seems best 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:21.520
 the better that's how you press 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:27.830
 the button and sap united to your blue and there 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:32.840
 we press the button here and that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:40.870
 blinks blue too and here I put in 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.870
 road a little bit you can hear 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 the helmet reacts very well 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:56.300
 hey it broke willy in safari 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.270
 but it goes really well at the level of 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.240
 sound at the volume is adjustable 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.120
 so if we like to have his forum and 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 strong if we like to make sense we will say 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.220
 between the two we are in between 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.750
 so there on the g2 good bah I'm two years old 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.060
 his world does not have a lot of sounds so 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.310
 it's true that it's not obvious I'm going 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.289
 you plug it on the penis assist 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.870
 but you will see that condiments 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:28.190
 road it's a smut not possible 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:35.199
 will shift the thing I turn off the g2 I 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:38.620
 remove adapter I take the premium this 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.620
 same operation 

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:48.039
 so on the premium this is a little more 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:06:02.189
 painful because as he has no 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:06:08.139
 little jack not obvious i have en route 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:11.559
 listen to the add the startup is that 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:17.679
 rips to the max that's good 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:25.539
 that I do last is not it 

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:33.579
 will be heard in the video the sound is 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:36.639
 hard enough i'll leave a little it's 

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:42.099
 because it is time that passes there 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:45.809
 so personally arrives for the 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:48.279
 price count a little more than 60 euros 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:51.610
 good it's still a good helmet it's enough 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.909
 aesthetic it has a beautiful the a beautiful 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.239
 mouth 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:59.679
 good if I do get it really 

00:06:54.239 --> 00:07:03.099
 a beautiful a nice mouth level 

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:07.659
 comfort on the ears we are well 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:10.629
 in that does not look too bad so that 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.519
 does not cost more than some 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.739
 helmets or if it can be a very small 

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:17.079
 little more expensive but what I liked 

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:20.639
 when I first told you 

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:25.779
 especially the adapter that is really 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:28.929
 very very small so I'm going to post 

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:31.599
 this video and for those who 

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:34.209
 I will give them the 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:36.069
 Required information 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:37.520
 thank you and then good evening to you and 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:41.410
 then good detection for 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.410
 who have a passion for infection
