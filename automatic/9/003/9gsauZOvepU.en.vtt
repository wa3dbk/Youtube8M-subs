00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
something and a little buckle that hides
the<00:00:29.849> end<00:00:30.000> where<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.960> two<00:00:31.140> pieces<00:00:31.349> connect

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the end where the two pieces connect

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.470 
the end where the two pieces connect
together<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> piece<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:32.910> important

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
together now this piece is important

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
together now this piece is important
because<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.780> lets<00:00:33.930> us<00:00:34.050> trigger<00:00:34.380> sounds<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
because it lets us trigger sounds in the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920 
because it lets us trigger sounds in the
Kotak<00:00:35.820> sector<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.360> there's<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> little

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Kotak sector because there's this little

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.229 
Kotak sector because there's this little
button<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.040> triggers<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> sound

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
button over here that triggers a sound

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
button over here that triggers a sound
and<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> tells<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.770> into

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and let's and tells it to go into

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
and let's and tells it to go into
henshin<00:00:42.090> mode<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> also<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.969> coloring<00:00:45.329> on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
henshin mode so also the coloring on

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
henshin mode so also the coloring on
this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> different<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> actual<00:00:46.620> show

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this is different from the actual show

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
this is different from the actual show
because<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.809> from<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> actual<00:00:49.230> show<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
because the one from the actual show is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.029 
because the one from the actual show is
actually<00:00:50.219> silver<00:00:50.700> though<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> can

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
actually silver though so that you can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
actually silver though so that you can
think<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> Kotak<00:00:54.090> exclusive<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
think of this as the Kotak exclusive and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
think of this as the Kotak exclusive and
this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.920> pleasing<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this is kind of not as pleasing as the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
this is kind of not as pleasing as the
Kabuto<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.930> accurate<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> Plus

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
Kabuto one which is so accurate and Plus

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
Kabuto one which is so accurate and Plus
this<00:00:58.949> part<00:00:59.219> over<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.670> light<00:01:00.600> silver

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
this part over here is light silver

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100 
this part over here is light silver
which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:02.160> appealing<00:01:02.750> plus<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> red

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
which is more appealing plus the red

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310 
which is more appealing plus the red
energy<00:01:04.470> bars<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.100> green<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:07.170> on

aren't hard to say which one I like

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
aren't hard to say which one I like
because<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.290> both<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> kaabah<00:01:59.040> -<00:01:59.280> well

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the LED and the Kotak LED - then there's

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.480 
the LED and the Kotak LED - then there's
the<00:02:03.509> on/off<00:02:03.899> switch<00:02:03.930> over<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.920> near

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the on/off switch over here and near

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.719 
the on/off switch over here and near
that<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.030> also<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> speaker<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.829> wish

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that is also the speaker which is I wish

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
that is also the speaker which is I wish
they<00:02:08.849> put<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.119> somewhere<00:02:09.300> else<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.099> if<00:02:11.099> but

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
they put it somewhere else but if but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.950 
they put it somewhere else but if but
where<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
where would they put the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.140 
where would they put the
the<00:02:13.590> speaker<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.070> what<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.520> wondering<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the speaker was what I was wondering and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
the speaker was what I was wondering and
if<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.780> did<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.230> somewhere<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.470> top<00:02:16.770> here

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
if they did put it somewhere on top here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.050 
if they did put it somewhere on top here
where<00:02:17.130> he<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.310> hear<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.580> better<00:02:17.670> I'd<00:02:17.850> probably

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
where he can hear it better I'd probably

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.520 
where he can hear it better I'd probably
ruin<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.850> look<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:21.960> either<00:02:22.080> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
ruin the look of it so it was either it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.160 
ruin the look of it so it was either it
looked<00:02:22.800> good<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.430> sounded<00:02:23.820> good<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.110> I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
looked good or it sounded good so and I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.210 
looked good or it sounded good so and I
guess<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.650> prefer<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.250> looking<00:02:26.610> good<00:02:27.270> then

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
guess I prefer it looking good then

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.670 
guess I prefer it looking good then
sounding<00:02:29.220> good<00:02:29.750> besides<00:02:30.750> its<00:02:30.930> role<00:02:31.470> play

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
sounding good besides its role play

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860 
sounding good besides its role play
towards<00:02:32.040> anyways<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.690> where

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
towards anyways and then here is where

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.780 
towards anyways and then here is where
the<00:02:33.990> battery<00:02:34.290> compartment<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.160> push<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the battery compartment is you push a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
the battery compartment is you push a
little<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.480> take<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.960> thin<00:02:37.470> piece

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
little you take a little thin piece

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830 
little you take a little thin piece
pushed<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.700> pop<00:02:39.000> goes<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.270> cover<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
pushed here and pop goes the cover and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.670 
pushed here and pop goes the cover and
takes<00:02:40.320> two<00:02:40.890> triple<00:02:41.190> A<00:02:41.250> batteries<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.200> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
takes two triple A batteries and so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.560 
takes two triple A batteries and so
that's<00:02:43.920> basically<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.880> let's<00:02:45.180> turn<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> on

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.000 

so<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.930> over<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.350> makes<00:02:55.590> two<00:02:55.770> sounds

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
so this one over here makes two sounds

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
so this one over here makes two sounds
when<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:57.230> regular<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.380> when<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.340> not

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
when it's in regular and when it's not

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.850 
when it's in regular and when it's not
on<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.670> tray

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.560 

not<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.010> much<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.460> not<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.090> much<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.540> as

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
not as much as the not as much or as

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.270 
not as much as the not as much or as
interesting<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> capital<00:03:07.860> sector<00:03:08.040> where

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
interesting as the capital sector where

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.680 
interesting as the capital sector where
it<00:03:08.400> actually<00:03:08.580> talked<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.450> kind<00:03:09.630> of

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it actually talked and I was kind of

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.420 
it actually talked and I was kind of
expecting<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.530> talk<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.220> did

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
expecting this one to talk but it did

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.060 
expecting this one to talk but it did
but<00:03:11.670> no<00:03:12.300> big<00:03:12.480> loss<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:13.350> does<00:03:13.620> however<00:03:13.860> have

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
but no big loss it does however have

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.460 
but no big loss it does however have
this<00:03:16.490> miss<00:03:17.490> state<00:03:17.820> us<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.330> bonus<00:03:18.900> sound<00:03:19.170> that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
this miss state us a bonus sound that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.320 
this miss state us a bonus sound that
you<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.220> never<00:03:20.400> hear<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> show<00:03:21.000> because

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
you will never hear in the show because

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.750 
you will never hear in the show because
when<00:03:21.540> they<00:03:21.660> transform<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:23.130> always<00:03:23.400> correct

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
when they transform it's always correct

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000 
when they transform it's always correct
they<00:03:23.880> never<00:03:24.090> flips<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> jaws<00:03:25.710> or<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
they never flips it with the jaws or the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
they never flips it with the jaws or the
horns<00:03:26.310> over<00:03:26.460> so<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.480> isn't<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.900> was<00:03:28.110> an

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
horns over so this isn't this was an

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.060 
horns over so this isn't this was an
interesting<00:03:28.440> bonus<00:03:28.950> sound<00:03:30.890> plus<00:03:31.890> that's<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
interesting bonus sound plus that's a

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.500 
interesting bonus sound plus that's a
nice<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> tell<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.090> didn't<00:03:33.390> do

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
nice way to tell you that you didn't do

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.500 
nice way to tell you that you didn't do
this<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.870> didn't<00:03:34.560> transform<00:03:35.070> right<00:03:38.510> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
this you didn't transform right and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.550 
this you didn't transform right and
that's<00:03:39.630> all<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:39.990> do<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.290> mode<00:03:40.530> so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that's all we can do in this mode so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.050 
that's all we can do in this mode so
let's<00:03:40.800> tread<00:03:41.760> attention<00:03:42.600> engine

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.809 

not<00:03:47.660> yell<00:03:47.959> idea<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.620> spins<00:03:48.920> around<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.550> far

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
not yell idea it spins around and so far

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.580 
not yell idea it spins around and so far
but<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:49.970> looks<00:03:50.090> really<00:03:50.270> cool<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.200> this<00:03:51.319> mode

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
but it looks really cool so in this mode

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.900 
but it looks really cool so in this mode
we<00:03:52.010> can<00:03:52.130> do<00:03:52.250> two<00:03:52.430> things

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
we can do two things

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.630 
we can do two things
fire<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.290> shoga<00:03:57.650> tact<00:03:57.920> has<00:03:58.100> two<00:03:58.310> dual

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
fire and the shoga tact has two dual

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.300 
fire and the shoga tact has two dual
cannons<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.360> shoulder<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.810> this

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
cannons on the shoulder and this

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.610 
cannons on the shoulder and this
pressing<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:01.640> pretty<00:04:01.850> much<00:04:02.470> makes<00:04:03.470> a

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
pressing this just pretty much makes a

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.440 
pressing this just pretty much makes a
sound<00:04:03.800> part<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.340> guess<00:04:04.580> this<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.850> how<00:04:04.970> he<00:04:05.030> fires

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
sound part I guess this is how he fires

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.250 
sound part I guess this is how he fires
it<00:04:05.600> but<00:04:05.989> never<00:04:06.440> seem<00:04:06.680> actually<00:04:06.860> pressing<00:04:07.520> that

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
it but never seem actually pressing that

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.140 
it but never seem actually pressing that
that's<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.470> can<00:04:09.590> do<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.739> except<00:04:10.310> for<00:04:10.340> this

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:24.220 

cast<00:04:14.150> off<00:04:21.910> change<00:04:22.910> stag<00:04:23.330> beetle<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.870> if<00:04:24.169> you

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
cast off change stag beetle and if you

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.480 
cast off change stag beetle and if you
flip<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.500> back<00:04:24.770> here<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:27.530> does<00:04:27.740> put<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.190> which

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
flip it back here it does put on which

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.700 
flip it back here it does put on which
only<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.330> incompetent<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.290> copper<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.650> a

only this incompetent the copper to a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.380 
only this incompetent the copper to a
sector<00:04:31.010> will<00:04:31.400> do<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.730> all<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> other<00:04:32.240> one

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
sector will do that all the other one

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.210 
sector will do that all the other one
all<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> other<00:04:33.020> sectors<00:04:33.260> don't<00:04:33.830> have<00:04:34.010> this

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
all the other sectors don't have this

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.690 
all the other sectors don't have this
feature<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.020> why<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.200> get<00:04:36.650> act<00:04:36.890> is<00:04:37.130> also

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
feature to this is why I get act is also

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.840 
feature to this is why I get act is also
a<00:04:38.180> sector<00:04:38.840> piece<00:04:39.050> that's<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.560> fourth<00:04:40.490> only

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
a sector piece that's a fourth only

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.560 
a sector piece that's a fourth only
because<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:41.990> really<00:04:42.380> show<00:04:42.740> accurate<00:04:43.570> but

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
because it it's really show accurate but

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.790 
because it it's really show accurate but
there's<00:04:44.720> something<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.080> don't<00:04:45.380> like<00:04:45.440> about<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
there's something I don't like about the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.159 
there's something I don't like about the
tax<00:04:46.070> sector<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.490> its<00:04:46.639> jaws<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.840> if<00:04:48.020> you're

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
tax sector is its jaws now if you're

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.600 
tax sector is its jaws now if you're
sitting<00:04:48.500> down<00:04:48.530> trying<00:04:48.979> to<00:04:49.010> play<00:04:49.250> with<00:04:49.280> this

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
sitting down trying to play with this

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.380 
sitting down trying to play with this
this<00:04:50.000> would<00:04:50.210> happen<00:04:51.880> pretend<00:04:52.880> your<00:04:53.000> lap<00:04:53.180> is

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
this would happen pretend your lap is

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.430 
this would happen pretend your lap is
over<00:04:53.630> here<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:56.180> would<00:04:56.450> kind<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.780> get<00:04:57.140> in<00:04:57.290> the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
over here it would kind of get in the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.500 
over here it would kind of get in the
way<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.800> Plus<00:04:58.010> after<00:04:58.460> playing<00:04:58.970> off<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.300> for<00:04:59.479> a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
way and Plus after playing off it for a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.450 
way and Plus after playing off it for a
while<00:04:59.720> the<00:05:00.020> jaws<00:05:00.260> kind<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.710> get<00:05:00.830> wonky<00:05:01.130> and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
while the jaws kind of get wonky and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.060 
while the jaws kind of get wonky and
loose<00:05:01.870> I'll<00:05:02.870> see<00:05:03.110> if<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.260> can<00:05:03.440> replicate<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.979> and

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
loose I'll see if I can replicate it and

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.330 
loose I'll see if I can replicate it and
replicate<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.870> just<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.919> causes

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
replicate it but it just it causes

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.340 
replicate it but it just it causes
sounds<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.850> not<00:05:08.030> play<00:05:08.360> or<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:08.960> they<00:05:09.110> are<00:05:09.140> on

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
sounds to not play or if they are on

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:21.720 
sounds to not play or if they are on
sounds<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.100> get<00:05:10.220> cut<00:05:10.430> short

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.330 

hmm<00:05:22.750> well<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.870> happened<00:05:24.170> to<00:05:24.230> be<00:05:24.350> early<00:05:25.100> on<00:05:25.130> when

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
hmm well it happened to be early on when

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.980 
hmm well it happened to be early on when
I<00:05:25.430> turned<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.790> on<00:05:25.910> but<00:05:26.150> after<00:05:26.510> playing<00:05:26.720> off<00:05:26.870> it

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
I turned it on but after playing off it

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.190 
I turned it on but after playing off it
for<00:05:27.230> a<00:05:27.260> while<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.710> gets<00:05:27.890> back<00:05:28.280> up<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.490> par<00:05:28.820> so

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
for a while it gets back up to par so

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.530 
for a while it gets back up to par so
yeah<00:05:30.200> not<00:05:30.590> sure<00:05:30.800> about<00:05:30.920> that<00:05:31.210> but<00:05:32.210> now<00:05:32.300> let's

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
yeah not sure about that but now let's

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.570 
yeah not sure about that but now let's
do<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:32.960> rider<00:05:33.230> kick<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:36.920> press<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.340> button

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
do a rider kick so you press the button

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.190 
do a rider kick so you press the button
three<00:05:37.820> times<00:05:37.850> for<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.810> one<00:05:39.020> two<00:05:39.170> three

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
three times for the one two three

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.500 
three times for the one two three
especially<00:05:39.740> if<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.890> saw<00:05:40.040> show<00:05:40.370> put<00:05:41.150> this<00:05:41.270> back

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
especially if you saw show put this back

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.730 
especially if you saw show put this back
here<00:05:44.140> right<00:05:45.140> here<00:05:46.930> hmm<00:05:47.930> that's<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.380> second

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
here right here hmm that's the second

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.410 
here right here hmm that's the second
time<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:49.040> did<00:05:49.160> that<00:05:49.370> they<00:05:49.700> actually<00:05:49.820> skip<00:05:50.270> the

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
time it did that they actually skip the

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.120 
time it did that they actually skip the
sound<00:05:50.690> over<00:05:50.960> there<00:05:51.140> so<00:05:51.380> let's<00:05:51.590> try<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.860> again

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
sound over there so let's try it again

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.380 
sound over there so let's try it again
it'll<00:05:52.340> suppose<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.580> have<00:05:52.670> a<00:05:52.700> charging<00:05:53.030> sound

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
it'll suppose to have a charging sound

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:02.890 
it'll suppose to have a charging sound
or<00:05:53.900> loading<00:06:01.300> that's<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.480> sound<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.780> was

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
or loading that's the sound it was

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.620 
or loading that's the sound it was
supposed<00:06:03.290> to<00:06:03.410> do<00:06:03.620> but<00:06:04.130> because<00:06:04.490> just<00:06:04.820> like<00:06:05.540> I

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
supposed to do but because just like I

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.000 
supposed to do but because just like I
said<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:05.900> gets<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.170> little<00:06:06.350> wonky<00:06:06.530> it<00:06:06.770> cuts

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
said this gets a little wonky it cuts

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.890 
said this gets a little wonky it cuts
off<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.250> sound<00:06:07.700> of<00:06:07.940> it<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:11.540> that's<00:06:11.690> all<00:06:11.870> I

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
off the sound of it and that's all I

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.200 
off the sound of it and that's all I
really<00:06:12.290> can<00:06:12.800> do<00:06:12.980> and<00:06:13.340> then<00:06:13.490> we<00:06:13.640> release<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.120> by

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
really can do and then we release it by

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.990 
really can do and then we release it by
holding<00:06:14.360> these<00:06:14.600> blue<00:06:14.780> buttons<00:06:15.790> that's<00:06:16.790> also

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
holding these blue buttons that's also

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.850 
holding these blue buttons that's also
the<00:06:17.120> same<00:06:17.300> sound<00:06:17.600> that<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.870> guy<00:06:18.050> raised<00:06:18.710> had

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
the same sound that the guy raised had

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.370 
the same sound that the guy raised had
enough<00:06:19.040> and<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:20.210> double<00:06:20.540> driver<00:06:20.840> when<00:06:21.200> you

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
enough and the double driver when you

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.860 
enough and the double driver when you
release<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.740> guy<00:06:22.220> 'memories<00:06:22.700> so<00:06:23.390> that's<00:06:23.660> one

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
release the guy 'memories so that's one

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.060 
release the guy 'memories so that's one
of<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.020> sounds<00:06:24.290> that<00:06:24.320> they<00:06:24.470> were<00:06:24.530> used<00:06:25.510> so<00:06:26.510> is

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
of the sounds that they were used so is

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.040 
of the sounds that they were used so is
detect<00:06:28.070> is<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:28.940> Kotak<00:06:29.210> sector<00:06:29.630> worth<00:06:29.810> owning

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
detect is the Kotak sector worth owning
