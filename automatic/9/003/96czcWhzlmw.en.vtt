steel<00:01:56.560> bearings<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:04.570> that's<00:02:04.690> like<00:02:04.780> a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
steel bearings I think that's like a

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.620 
steel bearings I think that's like a
retrospect<00:02:05.470> kind<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:06.090> stem<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.479> could

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
retrospect kind of stem I think I could

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.710 
retrospect kind of stem I think I could
be<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.260> bar<00:02:08.830> become<00:02:09.250> become<00:02:09.880> freer<00:02:10.270> after

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
be the bar become become freer after

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:25.020 
be the bar become become freer after
like<00:02:13.720> an<00:02:13.840> echo<00:02:14.200> head<00:02:14.410> something

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.600
