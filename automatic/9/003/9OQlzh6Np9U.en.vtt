00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.370
 this may be a hard-fought victory 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.770
 think i want you guys 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.209
 yes you can, you can tell 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.160
 no go stuff from a match you see 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.799
 that can certainly churn heavily fought 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.360
 but nevertheless they are correct 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.550
 the more beautiful and the more important 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.410
 me to take these points home 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.180
 i have i want to feel the current 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.590
 Feyenoord to also light the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.059
 that fights soccer 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.279
 yes I think so but I am also the 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.860
 I think it should be basic 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.300
 my club as feyenoord who first what you 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.670
 must do a fight while 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.830
 Sarah and duel win that they are important 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.240
 then you know that the rest can happen by itself 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.590
 come or not 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.540
 I go to a game easier 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.030
 many other competitions for tomorrow 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.290
 the mesh for us is a life of struggle and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.140
 and then I know that as a fighting life 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.120
 that few came team say 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.579
 be stronger than most teams I think 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 and such a match can also be a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.739
 fantastic goal with with 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.660
 a delicious one 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.980
 ball of yours wants before you that spanish 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 then you know exactly how 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.730
 is going to walk 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.120
 no that's why i'm going to put that in your though in the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.520
 fraction 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.799
 yes that goes very fast but I know 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.170
 that jens more often makes those walking actions 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.940
 and I also often given but 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 don't think so good and so beautiful 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.780
 as today actually there in advance 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.100
 you never know how it goes and me 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.229
 saw him walking he no I try 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 just that they what i what i often go through 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.100
 risk me game take a try 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.750
 try to give nice perch 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.580
 yes today that luckily succeeded there 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.560
 he makes him fantastic in the end 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.120
 all through the keeper still delivers eventually 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 just three points up 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.850
 that makes you important name is jens 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.110
 mark another man who is very important 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.580
 and we see that after the game 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 everyone walks straight to it 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 your goalkeeper yes you know for sure 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.310
 give compliments 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.170
 I think not only today but also the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.630
 last matches kik the kik the heel 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.700
 very good which is important to us 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 very important to all to stop 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.840
 very important moment in a competition 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.570
 Of course yes nice if you like one 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.200
 chicken behind it you actually have the the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.390
 goal actually 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.590
 clean hand is the false start 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.030
 van feyenoord with this competition anyway 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.280
 brush away the traditional 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.250
 top three is again at the top as on 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.049
 maybe should be and and now for 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 worth 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.170
 Janelle I think so but it will be 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 in the out of three and we have to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.680
 as a team, we are of course 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.019
 have a dramatic start 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.720
 fortunately have it reversed 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.360
 there are some point two languages ​​and good 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.110
 Radiation is increasingly becoming yes 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.819
 the team 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.349
 the game again that you go up again 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 look instead of down 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.510
 this is the only thing that still worries 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.519
 yet your relatively low number 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.660
 goals scored when you look 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.250
 defensive 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.200
 fantastic least follow me from the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.049
 but all dirty but still made the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.230
 problem if we win every competition 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.489
 with 100 or 200 I don't care 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.959
 believe we have the most 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.269
 goal attempt to catch the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.950
 Eredivisie that also indicates what and what 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.480
 you say one of the crime against the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.310
 it turned out that we are strong in the back 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 and creating evil in terms of attacks 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.530
 very much 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.350
 of course, there may occasionally be a few 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.000
 extra in or or mother and barked extremely 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.500
 but I think we as a team on this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.579
 don't look at that moment 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.260
 the most important thing for us is just the 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.989
 three points and one that was her disappointment 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.970
 team that may 30 in the back misses the chance or 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.250
 to make a picture in sorry and esteem 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.630
 you do as a team and you have three points 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.880
 high there are also as a team that I think 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.600
 the biggest compliment I have of nights 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.600
 I to ten
