00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
videos over the christmas break but they

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.810 
videos over the christmas break but they
didn't<00:00:40.490> really<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:41.030> there<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.950> hits<00:00:43.610> i

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
didn't really get there the hits i

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.940 
didn't really get there the hits i
wanted<00:00:44.950> for<00:00:45.950> example<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:48.260> know<00:00:48.290> they<00:00:48.800> got

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
wanted for example you know they got

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.190 
wanted for example you know they got
like<00:00:49.070> 400<00:00:49.370> hits<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.300> on<00:00:50.630> something<00:00:51.050> I

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
like 400 hits like on on something I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.780 
like 400 hits like on on something I
that<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.650> thought<00:00:51.980> was<00:00:52.190> pretty<00:00:52.400> interesting

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
that I thought was pretty interesting

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.720 
that I thought was pretty interesting
for<00:00:53.240> example<00:00:53.630> depth<00:00:54.050> charge<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.980> think<00:00:55.610> it's

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
for example depth charge I think it's

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.040 
for example depth charge I think it's
only<00:00:55.940> around<00:00:56.060> four<00:00:56.420> hundred<00:00:56.450> hits<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:59.020> what<00:01:00.020> I

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
only around four hundred hits so what I

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.999 
only around four hundred hits so what I
think<00:01:00.320> I'm<00:01:00.410> going<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.560> do<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:02.560> maybe<00:01:03.560> just

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
think I'm going to do is maybe just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.810 
think I'm going to do is maybe just
release<00:01:04.850> one<00:01:05.920> video<00:01:06.920> every<00:01:06.979> two<00:01:07.640> or<00:01:07.760> three
