the beginning of this gameplay has I
haven't<00:02:30.940> experienced<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.360> Halo<00:02:32.900> 4<00:02:33.140> yet

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
haven't experienced that in Halo 4 yet

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.229 
haven't experienced that in Halo 4 yet
something<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:34.129> quick<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.760> fast<00:02:35.000> pace

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
something that quick in that fast pace

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.390 
something that quick in that fast pace
just<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.049> general<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.920> maps<00:02:37.190> are

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
just because in general the maps are

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300 
just because in general the maps are
much<00:02:37.700> larger<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.840> these<00:02:39.019> community<00:02:39.799> small

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
much larger but these community small

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.559 
much larger but these community small
maps<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.599> action<00:02:42.200> packed<00:02:42.340> intense<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.299> much

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
maps so action packed intense so much

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.990 
maps so action packed intense so much
fun<00:02:44.930> getting<00:02:45.140> multi<00:02:45.829> kills<00:02:46.190> up<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.670> wazoo

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
fun getting multi kills up the wazoo

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.150 
fun getting multi kills up the wazoo
it's<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.920> intense<00:02:50.379> awesomeness<00:02:51.379> now<00:02:52.010> this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
it's just intense awesomeness now this

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.550 
it's just intense awesomeness now this
map<00:02:52.430> right<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> don't<00:02:53.690> know<00:02:53.870> exactly

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
map right now I don't know exactly

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.720 
map right now I don't know exactly
what's<00:02:54.799> called<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.040> can't<00:02:55.220> remember<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:55.579> it's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
what's called I can't remember but it's

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.410 
what's called I can't remember but it's
probably<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.629> of<00:02:56.660> my<00:02:56.780> favorite<00:02:57.620> maps<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
probably one of my favorite maps in this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.289 
probably one of my favorite maps in this
playlist<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:01.010> love<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.579> way<00:03:01.609> it's<00:03:01.910> design

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
playlist I just love the way it's design

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.380 
playlist I just love the way it's design
it<00:03:02.870> reminds<00:03:03.379> me<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.500> lot<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.609> halo<00:03:04.910> one

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
it reminds me a lot of the halo one

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.449 
it reminds me a lot of the halo one
style<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:06.079> map<00:03:06.349> design<00:03:06.560> where<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.010> more<00:03:07.129> of<00:03:07.310> a

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
style of map design where it's more of a

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.420 
style of map design where it's more of a
room<00:03:08.030> based<00:03:08.690> map<00:03:09.319> design<00:03:09.530> unless<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.220> a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
room based map design unless of a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.300 
room based map design unless of a
arena-style<00:03:11.120> map<00:03:12.049> design<00:03:12.230> where<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:13.099> rooms

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
arena-style map design where the rooms

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.000 
arena-style map design where the rooms
are<00:03:13.459> more<00:03:13.670> broken<00:03:14.359> up<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.810> sectioned<00:03:15.590> off<00:03:15.680> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
are more broken up and sectioned off and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.330 
are more broken up and sectioned off and
a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.239> times<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.930> kind<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.889> map<00:03:19.160> design

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
a lot of times that kind of map design

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.640 
a lot of times that kind of map design
ends<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.150> not<00:03:20.359> working<00:03:20.419> very<00:03:20.930> good<00:03:21.319> because

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
ends up not working very good because

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.830 
ends up not working very good because
the<00:03:22.160> flow<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.970> pace<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.419> game<00:03:23.630> gets

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the flow and pace of the game gets

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.580 
the flow and pace of the game gets
really<00:03:24.230> choppy<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.130> weird<00:03:25.549> but<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.299> map

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
really choppy and weird but this map

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.470 
really choppy and weird but this map
really<00:03:27.590> seems<00:03:27.889> to<00:03:28.099> capture<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.880> action<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
really seems to capture the action and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.800 
really seems to capture the action and
keep<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.650> contained<00:03:31.269> while<00:03:32.269> having<00:03:32.690> this

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
keep it contained while having this

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.870 
keep it contained while having this
really<00:03:33.349> awesome<00:03:33.560> interesting<00:03:34.340> design<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.819> I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
really awesome interesting design and I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.599 
really awesome interesting design and I
love<00:03:35.419> that<00:03:35.450> about<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.169> I<00:03:36.500> also<00:03:36.739> love<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
love that about it and I also love the

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.780 
love that about it and I also love the
design<00:03:38.470> visually<00:03:39.470> about<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.919> because<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.489> uses

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
design visually about it because it uses

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.690 
design visually about it because it uses
and<00:03:41.150> implement<00:03:41.540> some<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:43.340> map

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
and implement some of the like map

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.550 
and implement some of the like map
features<00:03:44.180> not<00:03:44.359> just<00:03:44.569> Forge<00:03:44.870> pieces<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:45.440> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
features not just Forge pieces but the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.210 
features not just Forge pieces but the
actual<00:03:45.829> map<00:03:46.190> features<00:03:46.639> like<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.650> ground<00:03:48.650> for

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
actual map features like the ground for

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.240 
actual map features like the ground for
the<00:03:49.459> like<00:03:50.090> asteroid<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:51.049> whatever<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.680> uses

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
the like asteroid or whatever and uses

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.830 
the like asteroid or whatever and uses
that<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.579> break<00:03:52.819> up<00:03:53.000> some<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.389> visual

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
that to break up some of the visual

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.780 
that to break up some of the visual
monotony<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.769> tend<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.069> get<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.519> forge

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
monotony that you tend to get the forge

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.170 
monotony that you tend to get the forge
maps<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.810> that's<00:03:57.230> really<00:03:57.970> really<00:03:58.970> awesome

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
maps so that's really really awesome

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.780 
maps so that's really really awesome
anyways<00:04:00.079> that'll<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.919> for<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.519> if

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
anyways that'll be it for this one if
