think<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> graphics<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.349> game<00:04:18.470> are<00:04:18.650> good

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
think the graphics in this game are good

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.710 
think the graphics in this game are good
but<00:04:19.609> they<00:04:19.760> could<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.150> been<00:04:20.299> better

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
but they could have been better

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.740 
but they could have been better

I'd<00:05:39.349> say<00:05:39.710> if<00:05:39.919> you're<00:05:40.070> getting<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.639> for<00:05:40.699> like<00:05:41.030> a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
I'd say if you're getting it for like a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.320 
I'd say if you're getting it for like a
console<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:42.139> not<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.349> PC<00:05:42.889> then<00:05:43.520> it's<00:05:44.000> most

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
console and not a PC then it's most

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330 
console and not a PC then it's most
likely<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.560> rent

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
likely and a rent
