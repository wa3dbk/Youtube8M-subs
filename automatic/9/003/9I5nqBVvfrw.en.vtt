00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
do so as we're getting into the summer

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
do so as we're getting into the summer
you<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> make<00:00:34.800> sure<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you just want to make sure and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.590 
you just want to make sure and
double-check<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> soil<00:00:36.559> at<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> bottom<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
double-check the soil at the bottom and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.010 
double-check the soil at the bottom and
check<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.899> sure<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.320> no<00:00:40.379> weeds<00:00:42.020> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
check and make sure there's no weeds and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.310 
check and make sure there's no weeds and
just<00:00:43.950> kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> give<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.670> nice<00:00:46.820> break<00:00:48.320> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just kind of give it a nice break and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
just kind of give it a nice break and
work<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.640> soil<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> may

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
work in some soil and I think we may

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
work in some soil and I think we may
even<00:00:57.329> add<00:00:57.660> some<00:00:57.690> straw<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.800> point<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
even add some straw at some point in the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
even add some straw at some point in the
summer<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.870> pretty<00:01:01.170> dry

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
summer because this can get pretty dry

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.929 
summer because this can get pretty dry
this<00:01:02.370> area<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:02.969> take<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> heat<00:01:04.939> summer

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this area does take a lot of heat summer

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
this area does take a lot of heat summer
we<00:01:06.420> got<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.720> worms<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> see
