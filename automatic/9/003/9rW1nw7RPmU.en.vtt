00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 pictures of windows 10 for smartphones 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.890
 it is not yet known if these images are 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.109
 really real or if they were made 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
 through an assembly of any 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.359
 way you can have a sense of how 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 it could be windows 10 for is to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.489
 smartphones 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.590
 I found it very simple could it seal 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.930
 be a little more like windows 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.579
 images is what leaking on the internet as it says 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.489
 it is not known if they are really real and are 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 few pictures can not be 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:58.730
 a lot of notion and the visual is that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 always is colors is well over ze black 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.609
 White 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.979
 I think it's cool but I think it tires a 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.180
 little anyway let's see how it goes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.920
