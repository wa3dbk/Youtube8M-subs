00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.010 
people and it was a fruit before I

I'd<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.529> ill<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.460> whole<00:00:23.640> life<00:00:23.670> with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I'd been ill for my whole life with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.740 
I'd been ill for my whole life with
celiac<00:00:24.840> disease<00:00:24.960> which<00:00:25.680> had<00:00:25.859> had<00:00:26.010> undiagnosed

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
celiac disease which had had undiagnosed

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.950 
celiac disease which had had undiagnosed
so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.080> had<00:00:28.380> pretty<00:00:28.920> much<00:00:29.130> wasted<00:00:29.369> away<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so I had pretty much wasted away to the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
so I had pretty much wasted away to the
point<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> death<00:00:31.700> because<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.000> wasn't

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
point of death because I wasn't

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.840 
point of death because I wasn't
absorbing<00:00:33.660> any<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.050> food<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.739> once<00:00:35.700> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
absorbing any of my food and once I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
absorbing any of my food and once I
found<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> had<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.930> still<00:00:37.739> found<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
found out what I had I still found it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
found out what I had I still found it
really<00:00:38.190> difficult<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.879> find<00:00:39.450> anything<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really difficult to find anything that I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.299 
really difficult to find anything that I
could<00:00:40.170> eat<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.739> stomach<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.190> really

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
could eat because my stomach was really

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
could eat because my stomach was really
damaged<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> changing<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> eating<00:00:43.530> raw<00:00:43.860> food

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
damaged and changing to eating raw food

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
damaged and changing to eating raw food
enabled<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> start<00:00:45.390> reabsorbing

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
enabled me to start reabsorbing

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.090 
enabled me to start reabsorbing
nutrients<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.910> weight<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.100> get

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
nutrients and going back weight and get

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
nutrients and going back weight and get
healthy<00:00:50.460> again<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.110> year<00:00:55.230> I've

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
healthy again it is the first year I've

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
healthy again it is the first year I've
attended<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.160> wood<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.460> free<00:00:56.640> festival<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
attended the wood so free festival and I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
attended the wood so free festival and I
think<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.440> event<00:00:58.770> because

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
think it's a great event because

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.069 
think it's a great event because
normally<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.699> quite<00:00:59.879> difficult

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
normally it can be quite difficult

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.080 
normally it can be quite difficult
socialising<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:02.160> raw<00:01:02.309> foodist<00:01:02.789> or<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
socialising as a raw foodist or a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
socialising as a raw foodist or a
fruitarian<00:01:03.589> because<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.700> aren't

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
fruitarian because there really aren't

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
fruitarian because there really aren't
people<00:01:06.180> who<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.600> where<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.290> coming<00:01:07.560> from

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
people who get where you're coming from

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
people who get where you're coming from
and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.270> chance<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.810> do

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and you don't have the chance to just do

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
and you don't have the chance to just do
things<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> normal<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.250> really

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
things in a normal way so it's really

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
things in a normal way so it's really
nice<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:12.720> environment<00:01:13.170> where

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
nice to be in an environment where

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690 
nice to be in an environment where
everyone's<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.040> eating<00:01:14.340> free<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.640> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
everyone's just eating free and that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
everyone's just eating free and that's
the<00:01:14.880> natural<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.229> everyone's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the natural thing to do and everyone's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
the natural thing to do and everyone's
really<00:01:16.650> healthy<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.159> relaxed<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.000> happy

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
really healthy and relaxed and happy

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.880 
really healthy and relaxed and happy
I<00:01:21.500> think<00:01:22.500> we'd<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.549> health<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.890> every

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I think we'd see the health of every

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
I think we'd see the health of every
nation<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.670> incredibly<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> even

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
nation go up incredibly because the even

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
nation go up incredibly because the even
countries<00:01:28.380> where<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.070> they're

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
countries where they think they're

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.410 
countries where they think they're
eating<00:01:29.310> quite<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> healthy<00:01:30.030> diet<00:01:30.210> there's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
eating quite a healthy diet there's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.679 
eating quite a healthy diet there's
still<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.900> animal<00:01:31.320> protein<00:01:32.479> too<00:01:33.479> many

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
still too much animal protein too many

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.010 
still too much animal protein too many
fats<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.380> people<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.250> generally

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
fats and people are just generally

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.210 
fats and people are just generally
expecting<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.320> health<00:01:37.560> problems<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:38.040> old

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
expecting to have health problems by old

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
expecting to have health problems by old
age<00:01:38.369> even<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.540> them<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
age even if they don't get them at a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
age even if they don't get them at a
very<00:01:40.020> young<00:01:40.350> age<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.030> initially

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
very young age so I think initially

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.420 
very young age so I think initially
would<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.380> huge<00:01:43.979> change<00:01:44.280> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
would just see like a huge change in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
would just see like a huge change in
people's<00:01:44.759> health<00:01:44.909> overall<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.170> also<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.829> think

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
people's health overall but also I think

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.300 
people's health overall but also I think
veganism<00:01:47.460> promotes<00:01:48.470> non-violence<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
veganism promotes non-violence and a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.410 
veganism promotes non-violence and a
peaceful<00:01:51.590> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> personality<00:01:53.490> overall<00:01:54.180> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
peaceful kind of personality overall so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
peaceful kind of personality overall so
I<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.110> drop<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.439> crime<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.520> war<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I would see a drop in crime and war and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.200 
I would see a drop in crime and war and
just<00:01:58.259> generally<00:01:58.979> people<00:01:59.159> being<00:01:59.399> happier<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
just generally people being happier and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
just generally people being happier and
better<00:02:00.689> people<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:03.950> yeah<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.070> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
better people really yeah I think just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.850 
better people really yeah I think just
really<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.630> eating<00:02:07.380> fruit<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860
