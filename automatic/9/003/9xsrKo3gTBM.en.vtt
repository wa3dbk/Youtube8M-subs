00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 no no 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.920
 hello friends of mx1 board we are here in 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.020
 Valkenswaard and well they finished the 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.910
 first sleeve the workouts and good 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.730
 the truth is that I did very well first 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.500
 the timed workouts 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.820
 then you can catch the loss of 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.930
 output that I like the most then 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.880
 caught a pretty grill by the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.390
 inside to ensure the exit and good 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.770
 come out second in the first sleeve and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 I kept the second three cures and I 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.210
 I put it first pretty fast it was 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.740
 quite difficult with these potholes and with 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.800
 these pilots follow the same pace but 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.440
 well you can finish the manga first and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 Looking forward to tomorrow to see if we can 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.610
 do 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.290
 the same or even roll a little 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 better that it takes you a little nervous 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.619
 do my first time I go first in 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.820
 a European of 125 then good up 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 tomorrow and see you hello mx friends are 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.200
 a board we have already finished the first 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.270
 valkenswaard manga and well then the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280
 truth is that it has not gone very well 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.539
 since the colonists already had a little 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 more luck I have not managed to make 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.560
 no good and good turn because it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.810
 finished the tenth there were many fallen and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.000
 a lot of difficulty on the track and good 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.310
 Afterwards, the manga left from the 20th 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.350
 Aug since it is not the best 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.670
 position and the output has not gone badly 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.770
 true but as it was a little bit wrong 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.299
 in the curve I have fallen a boy 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.090
 front and I practically have to stop 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.039
 had to dodge the following curve 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 I have fallen another before and well then 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.840
 the first round was behind and maximum 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.399
 It was far behind and well then 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.720
 from there he began to try to trace 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.459
 maximum possible 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.890
 maybe and tried to throw too much 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.420
 strong and good that's when I fell 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 the first time at 10 minutes more or 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.510
 less 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.610
 and well, since it has been 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.530
 all shot but worse I have not fallen 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 right away and then he arrived very tired 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.710
 the settings 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 we have put the expressions I think that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.820
 we have not guessed right that we're going to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 go a bit in the opposite direction the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.430
 circuit was the worst I've seen 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 never and good then another experience more 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.290
 that gives us a lot and try tomorrow 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.360
 do it much better than sure that the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.970
 circuit is better with pressures 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.380
 we have learned a lot and good, well, that's 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.360
 try to fix today's paper 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.760
 thank you very much for following us today Saturday 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.080
 we are here in sea â€‹â€‹basketball in the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.360
 facts we understand that I do not enter 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.310
 Givers and the sleeve and good 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.780
 at the beginning it has cost me a bit 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.510
 adapt the circuit because it is enough 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.360
 sandy and the jumps and such are very 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.050
 complicated with ruts and good I've 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.000
 could classify just 18 and then 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.850
 for the manga the truth that I had a 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
 very open grill to go well and 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.990
 I have left on 20 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.500
 I lost a few positions later 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.340
 I had a small fall in a curve 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.550
 Y 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.319
 and when I got up, the truth was quite 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.360
 tired and then I was focusing on catching 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.810
 a little bit of rhythm and learn to drive in 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.430
 sand that I could not train any 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.840
 day here in the Netherlands and well I have 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.500
 very complicated fact 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.540
 finally finished in position 25 and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.510
 good the last wills I dress 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.390
 much better and see tomorrow how it is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 gives us the day I want to thank the team 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.060
 and it's racing all your support and well I hope 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.510
 that we can soon do better 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.510
 results 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.190
 with waters and waters
