 the journey itself from Odessa to Sochi 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.720

 one a few initiatives which our 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.730
 organizations various organizations 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.960
 incoming our network plans to implement 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.450
 this is ours to carry out 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.870
 very very short term here 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.510
 There are representatives of the organization Alim 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 could if you are interested you can 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.700
 say these plans opened them there 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.990
 but I just want to say that the price is 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.060
 This is a set of initiatives that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.520
 provide for the dialogue of various 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.510
 social strata in different regions 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.530
 Ukraine and under the Donbass gave and how 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.590
 there is a program to be implemented 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.660
 there will be just a dialogue you are not 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.450
 just construction talk 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.870
 quite multistage enough too 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.550
 percentage and Odessa, we first and can 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.739
 be the only city for now 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.720
 I hope so far the only city that 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.570
 consciously supports dialogue as ideas 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.700
 generally really the site in Ukraine 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.690
 those projects that will be now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.400
 start off 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.340
 they relate to different regions practically 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.750
 also the whole country that is what we 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.450
 discussed the information that is 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.880
 how is he doing there some organizations 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.370
 there with 12 areas and all the rest 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.070
 as if added yes there works 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.019
 a little afraid previous question i don't 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.660
 I also managed to talk to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.900
 people who can only shoot two 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.310
 years ago they knew how to do something 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.360
 where besides shoot is the question that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.920
 was backwards and here are yours like there too 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.390
 some degree addition speaks of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.069
 that we are in a situation 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.140
 really hard enough 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.040
 separation of polarization regardless 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.159
 from whether we have a physical war 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.049
 or not 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.599
 11,500 are whole and take it you me 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.640
 every world 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.920
 if I understand correctly your question is not 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.209
 according to the carabineer but by itself 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.470
 between the media itself 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.670
 it depends on its beers or skype 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.519
 eggs without these thieves of water 7 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.270
 purpose of payment language and where is king and form 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.460
 years or girl so cheer and not only 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.199
 This ship will be at 1,000 or 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.210
 we believe that these thousands of people they 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.400
 information carriers they will they 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.970
 spread what they see got 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.199
 they say sociality and write in 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:45.400
 the city or comes pass to failure 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:49.599
 mince and collect and here is plus about d e c n 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.110
 but as the initiator founder of the ship of the world 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.120
 I really want to see the ships of the world 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.440
 had the function of divulging the truth about 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.710
 what is happening in various places 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.710
 of the world
