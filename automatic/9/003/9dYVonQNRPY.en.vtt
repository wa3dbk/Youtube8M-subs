 hello friends of miguel cotto 8 together with 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.120
 today I will explain 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.700
 how to tune 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.949
 ela and ccoo 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.879
 practically what we're going to do is change the total appearance of the 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.839
 device 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689
 and with two funds 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.380
 percent 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.669
 the icons of 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.199
 wi-fi 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.880
 the name all 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.089
 to carry out this 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.339
 the task is not used the course my 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.380
 sam epo 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.140
 we can both find it in the installer 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 the main ones are in place 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.580
 if they are installed directly 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.730
 with two clicks the first one is called 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.550
 custo minister two points 0 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.380
 and the second one we find under the name 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.430
 sam boil 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.090
 with the taste we can meet directly 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.370
 installed 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 we also have to try to install 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.390
 percent 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690
 a small fix 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.610
 what is the psv quite 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.140
 fiction 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.110
 what is it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.799
 allows us to run the mixed course n in him there is your aunt who 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.760
 it's all if they are not installed 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 directly when running session 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980
 she knows what we look for we installed 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.800
 i 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.150
 and we passed directly 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.840
 execute them 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.100
 before executing the custom that's what we have month that with extras 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.890
 bitter we have it here 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 and here we have to 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.759
 they made sure I have peter peter 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.160
 this sense 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.170
 and he showed it we paid 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.700
 this sense just like the option 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.050
 a hit 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 also this sense 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.030
 to me if you want you can sentence from others that 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.510
 can change the state of the barrier or psychological 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.090
 good to use the same conclusion that I use 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.239
 and here in tennis rash 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.350
 the selected one is customized 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.739
 so that it is percussionist that is in charge 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.679
 they understand 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.629
 once configured this 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.159
 we pass now although this to custom clot in the bottom 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.889
 we do not execute 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.419
 it's going on 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.679
 now that we have several options 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.999
 we have the tenancy search 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.209
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.419
 just thousands of images and sounds 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.540
 they were cow 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.769
 own security edit the system 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.089
 important 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.379
 with the portal we can bring tennis 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.610
 the samán wedding 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.419
 here 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 but practically estimate that this one has more than 1700 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.489
 peanuts so 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.129
 I do not think it's 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.539
 something very special 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.929
 The preferences 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:04.749
 and finally the one that the option to leave to subtract the stirrup arts in the 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.209
 what will we do in the end 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.029
 so that everything is applied 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 now we will go to the temple 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.389
 we have the option is 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.059
 theme intensify the bottom 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.489
 new 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.159
 a top 40 like the best tennis 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.939
 we have all the subjects that shows us 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.939
 organized alphabetically 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.189
 and finally 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.449
 We have the country etc 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.499
 which is to choose directly if we want to change something in specific 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.219
 if we want to watch only change the bar if we want to change the sound 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.229
 mainly what I love to use 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.469
 I liked the one in this example being the top 40 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.369
 where are the most voted 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.039
 that you can find several fronts 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.909
 and the best is 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.060
 that before installing it we can use the prevented 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.239
 and he is not going to show 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.229
 a temple estate 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.539
 to have been exposed 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.529
 and if so, download it 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.869
 to see for example this macrismo 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:13.969
 We can see 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.749
 what are the icons 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.749
 what would be the battery status 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 the fire 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.390
 for example we want to be him 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.139
 since last January 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.139
 we are here 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 it is taking 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.969
 here we can see 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.180
 the award 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.309
 from your typical mac background 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.990
 the ecologists 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.270
 the selection that we like 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.639
 we went to 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.960
 click on toulon 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 the one that we have here on the top 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.409
 the camera 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.539
 let's download 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.539
 espasa download it 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.259
 this company 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.259
 funeral with 758 the home 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.770
 but you do not have to be well 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.169
 once downloaded 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.800
 in the bottom 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.300
 we can already have two options 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.949
 we have the apply of badghis 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.240
 thea thematically capitality 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.020
 all tennis 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.619
 or we have the api holguín in which we can decide 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.229
 it is highly that what we want that 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.610
 I modified 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.879
 we can catch 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.219
 or that only 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.809
 the api that the and when there are only images fire to pp 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.449
 with sound themes 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.120
 the sounds of the mobile 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.509
 incoming flames images 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.589
 or we can directly pass 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.610
 to never 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.999
 it does not modify it completely 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:25.339
 I know that and to your liking in this case we will use 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:26.730
 all the device 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.499
 we see how it starts 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.499
 to modify it 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.819
 let's go back again 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.110
 just my again and we're going to the bottom 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.099
 and we click 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:43.819
 in pursuing 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.919
 wait for borja 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.580
 just what will he do is 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.879
 reset everything again 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.779
 and here we already see 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.110
 in the changed the subject 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.619
 was using another foot 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.619
 that I have here the view 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.649
 this modifies completely 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.430
 completely modifies me 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.670
 the one waiting for the upper part the carca symbol 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:27.559
 justly 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.270
 of staff explained 

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.659

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:37.770
 that does not change it completely Navarre displacement 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.740
 the hope system 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.740
 psychologists the way he recovers 

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:48.679
