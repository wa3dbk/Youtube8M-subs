00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
see it goes back to the normal place so

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.899 
see it goes back to the normal place so
here<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.519> have<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.150> place<00:02:43.419> to<00:02:43.659> put<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.980> in

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
here you have the place to put this in

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.189 
here you have the place to put this in
it<00:02:46.230> okay<00:02:47.230> now<00:02:48.219> another<00:02:48.519> problem<00:02:49.120> could<00:02:49.629> be<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.199 
it okay now another problem could be the

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.830 
it okay now another problem could be the
analogic<00:02:50.680> stick<00:02:50.980> who<00:02:51.489> isn't<00:02:51.849> moving<00:02:52.480> very

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
analogic stick who isn't moving very

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.360 
analogic stick who isn't moving very
smoothly<00:02:53.469> you<00:02:54.189> can<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.699> pull<00:02:55.389> put<00:02:56.079> back<00:02:56.370> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
smoothly you can just pull put back this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.939 
smoothly you can just pull put back this
plastic<00:02:57.909> put<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.689> little<00:02:58.870> bit<00:02:59.019> oil<00:02:59.319> in<00:02:59.500> here<00:02:59.769> and

00:02:59.939 --> 00:02:59.949 
plastic put a little bit oil in here and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.339 
plastic put a little bit oil in here and
it<00:03:00.400> should<00:03:00.549> be<00:03:00.730> okay<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:01.239> it's<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.260> you

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
it should be okay if it's not and you

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.729 
it should be okay if it's not and you
can<00:03:02.409> have<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.980> cheap<00:03:03.819> controller<00:03:04.389> you<00:03:05.319> can<00:03:05.500> also

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
can have a cheap controller you can also

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.009 
can have a cheap controller you can also
dis<00:03:06.459> solder<00:03:06.969> this<00:03:07.629> parts<00:03:08.439> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.069> controller

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
dis solder this parts of the controller

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.309 
dis solder this parts of the controller
take<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:12.189> analytic<00:03:12.699> stick<00:03:12.939> out<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:13.509> re

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
take the analytic stick out of it re

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.479 
take the analytic stick out of it re
solar<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.889> new<00:03:15.069> one

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
solar the new one

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.869 
solar the new one
another<00:03:16.269> problem<00:03:16.599> could<00:03:17.139> be<00:03:17.519> vibrating<00:03:18.519> that

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
another problem could be vibrating that

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.039 
another problem could be vibrating that
your<00:03:19.329> controller<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.169> not<00:03:20.349> rumbling<00:03:20.590> anymore

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
your controller is not rumbling anymore

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.670 
your controller is not rumbling anymore
so<00:03:23.049> here<00:03:23.979> we<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.489> two<00:03:24.939> wires<00:03:25.359> of<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.349> motor

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so here we have two wires of the motor

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.449 
so here we have two wires of the motor
here<00:03:27.519> we<00:03:27.699> have<00:03:27.939> two<00:03:28.329> other<00:03:28.599> ones<00:03:29.009> that<00:03:30.009> makes

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
here we have two other ones that makes

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.229 
here we have two other ones that makes
the<00:03:30.879> motor<00:03:31.090> turn<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:33.040> D<00:03:33.579> solder<00:03:34.030> or

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the motor turn so you can D solder or

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.330 
the motor turn so you can D solder or
race<00:03:34.509> over<00:03:34.780> those<00:03:35.109> wires<00:03:36.659> so<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:37.989> think<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.889> set

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
race over those wires so I think I set

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.069 
race over those wires so I think I set
everything<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:43.120> can<00:03:43.329> mount<00:03:43.599> a

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
everything now we can mount a

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.339 
everything now we can mount a
PlayStation<00:03:45.009> 2<00:03:45.040> controller<00:03:45.340> again<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.349> just

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
have to put those plastics on it turn it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.089 
have to put those plastics on it turn it
backwards<00:03:50.699> put<00:03:51.699> the<00:03:52.359> rest<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.959> put<00:03:53.859> the
