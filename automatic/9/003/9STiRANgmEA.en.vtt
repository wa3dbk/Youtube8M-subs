00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you just test this again control enter a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.109 
you just test this again control enter a
command<00:00:13.710> enter<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> Mac<00:00:15.410> we<00:00:16.410> can<00:00:16.560> draw<00:00:17.119> we

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
command enter on a Mac we can draw we

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.769 
command enter on a Mac we can draw we
can<00:00:18.330> change<00:00:19.080> colors<00:00:19.590> though<00:00:20.300> we<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.510> use<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
can change colors though we can use the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.859 
can change colors though we can use the
erase<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.640> erase<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.029> tore<00:00:24.269> default<00:00:24.630> color

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
erase and erase it tore default color

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.720 
erase and erase it tore default color
which<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.500> back<00:00:25.650> color<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.609> probably

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
which is the back color it's probably

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.099 
which is the back color it's probably
actually<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.300> function<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.550> make<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.109> color

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
actually a function to make it the color

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
actually a function to make it the color
but<00:00:31.500> we'll<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.759> now

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
but we'll just use it like this for now

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.010 
but we'll just use it like this for now
and<00:00:33.380> then<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.980> hit<00:00:35.130> size<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.780> will<00:00:36.780> change

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and then you can hit size up will change

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
and then you can hit size up will change
the<00:00:37.170> size<00:00:37.670> what<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> Q<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.610> yeah<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the size what is Q and then yeah if I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
the size what is Q and then yeah if I
hit<00:00:42.210> size<00:00:42.450> down<00:00:43.460> sighs<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:47.120> up<00:00:48.120> yeah

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
hit size down sighs will go down up yeah

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.000 
hit size down sighs will go down up yeah
please<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.219> um<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> yes<00:00:51.809> let's<00:00:52.500> test

please get it um and yes let's test
something<00:00:53.340> real<00:00:53.640> quick<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.719> keep

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
something real quick I just keep

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
something real quick I just keep
clicking<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.559> plus<00:00:55.770> button<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
clicking the plus button and then it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
clicking the plus button and then it
goes<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.760> big<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.750> legends<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
goes really big the legends because it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
goes really big the legends because it
can<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> won't<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.059> any<00:01:03.090> bigger<00:01:03.390> yes

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
can go so it won't go any bigger yes

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.429 
can go so it won't go any bigger yes
that's<00:01:04.409> still<00:01:04.769> does<00:01:04.949> erased<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:06.830> that

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
that's still does erased because that

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's still does erased because that
doesn't<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.490> reason

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
doesn't work right for some reason

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.649 
doesn't work right for some reason
because<00:01:12.060> since<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.020> big<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:15.360> just

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
because since it's so big it just

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.350 
because since it's so big it just
erasing<00:01:16.200> soon<00:01:16.409> anyway<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:17.070> phantom<00:01:18.030> s<00:01:18.180> up

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
erasing soon anyway I know phantom s up

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
erasing soon anyway I know phantom s up
there<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.040> decrease<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
there but now if you just decrease it a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.410 
there but now if you just decrease it a
whole<00:01:21.450> bunch

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
whole bunch

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.380 
whole bunch
you'll<00:01:24.380> see<00:01:24.650> that<00:01:24.890> doesn't<00:01:25.189> go<00:01:25.400> lower<00:01:25.610> than

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.460 

100

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.940 

oh<00:01:36.290> they're<00:01:37.290> lagging

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.779 

hold<00:01:40.579> on<00:01:40.759> okay<00:01:41.719> there<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.049> go<00:01:42.100> yeah<00:01:43.100> now<00:01:43.729> you

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
hold on okay there we go yeah now you

hold on okay there we go yeah now you
can<00:01:44.000> see<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:45.649> won't<00:01:45.860> go<00:01:46.009> any<00:01:46.039> smaller<00:01:46.340> than

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
can see it won't go any smaller than

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.270 
can see it won't go any smaller than
that<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.689> if<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.869> hit<00:01:48.049> plus<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.770> will<00:01:49.039> go

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
that but if you hit plus up it will go

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.810 
that but if you hit plus up it will go
back<00:01:49.820> 625<00:01:51.429> yeah<00:01:52.719> you're<00:01:53.719> clicking<00:01:53.929> sy<00:01:54.820> anyways

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
back 625 yeah you're clicking sy anyways

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.300 
back 625 yeah you're clicking sy anyways
so<00:01:56.240> now<00:01:57.079> I'm<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.409> pause<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.920> catch

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
so now I'm going to pause it catch

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.919 
so now I'm going to pause it catch
something<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:58.939> then<00:01:59.090> unpause<00:01:59.509> ative<00:01:59.810> it

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
something and then unpause ative it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.499 
something and then unpause ative it
works<00:02:00.579> yes<00:02:02.950> 10<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.700> I'm<00:02:04.819> positive<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
works yes 10 it I'm positive it's the

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.990 
works yes 10 it I'm positive it's the
same<00:02:05.689> spot<00:02:05.840> okay<00:02:06.619> anyway<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.340> yes<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.819> did

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
same spot okay anyway so yes I did

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.509 
same spot okay anyway so yes I did
notice<00:02:08.179> something<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.160> we'll<00:02:10.160> do<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.369> really

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
notice something and we'll do it really

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.600 
notice something and we'll do it really
quick<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.810> might<00:02:12.019> actually<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.410> in<00:02:12.709> two

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
quick this might actually be in two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.270 
quick this might actually be in two
parts<00:02:14.090> because<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:15.140> might<00:02:15.319> probably<00:02:15.680> be<00:02:16.010> over

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
parts because it might probably be over

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.600 
parts because it might probably be over
ten<00:02:16.700> minutes<00:02:17.150> anyways<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.560> go<00:02:18.739> over<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.220> this

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
ten minutes anyways so go over to this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.960 
ten minutes anyways so go over to this
dot<00:02:20.060> onmousedown<00:02:20.720> equals<00:02:21.650> function<00:02:22.130> we're

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
dot onmousedown equals function we're

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.000 
dot onmousedown equals function we're
drawing<00:02:23.329> tools<00:02:23.660> true<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:24.650> drawing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
drawing tools true and then if drawing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.009 
drawing tools true and then if drawing
does<00:02:25.400> equal<00:02:25.579> true<00:02:26.829> we'll<00:02:27.829> add<00:02:28.700> an<00:02:29.150> aunt<00:02:29.599> and

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
does equal true we'll add an aunt and

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.080 
does equal true we'll add an aunt and
there<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.730> we'll<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:33.880> scroll<00:02:34.880> down<00:02:35.060> here

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
there and we'll put a scroll down here

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.289 
there and we'll put a scroll down here
and<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:36.140> from<00:02:36.380> either<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.120> copy

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
and go from either one this is a copy
