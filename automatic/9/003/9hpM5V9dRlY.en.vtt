00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
they've been around forever that means

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.879 
they've been around forever that means
after<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.900> if<00:03:16.139> this<00:03:16.319> movie<00:03:16.560> does<00:03:16.709> well

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
after this if this movie does well

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.770
