charging source right there and that
cord<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> included<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.990> what's<00:01:10.590> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
cord is included with this what's really

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
cord is included with this what's really
nice<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.340> speaker's<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> don't

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
nice about the speaker's that you don't

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.960 
nice about the speaker's that you don't
see<00:01:12.390> often<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> USB

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
see often is right here we have a USB

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.710 
see often is right here we have a USB
port<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:17.820> charge<00:01:18.360> your

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
port and that will actually charge your

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.920 
port and that will actually charge your
smart<00:01:19.020> device<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.680> has<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.189> backup<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.750> think

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
smart device it has a backup of I think

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.440 
smart device it has a backup of I think
it's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> thousand<00:01:22.680> milliamps<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's a thousand milliamps so you can

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
it's a thousand milliamps so you can
charge<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.930> device<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
charge your device right from this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
charge your device right from this
speaker<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> speaker<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> very

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
speaker now the speaker is very

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
speaker now the speaker is very
lightweight<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.420> doesn't<00:01:30.450> weigh<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:30.930> much

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
lightweight it doesn't weigh very much

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
lightweight it doesn't weigh very much
at<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:33.840> puts<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> quite<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
at all and it actually puts out quite a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
at all and it actually puts out quite a
bit<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> sound<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.509> bass<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.140> actually

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
bit of sound and the bass I'm actually

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.899 
bit of sound and the bass I'm actually
really<00:01:37.680> impressed<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.700> mean

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really impressed this thing just I mean

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.429 
really impressed this thing just I mean
it<00:01:39.030> rattles<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:39.689> no<00:01:39.810> rubber<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it rattles there's no rubber on the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
it rattles there's no rubber on the
bottom<00:01:40.590> maybe<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.310> added<00:01:41.640> some

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
bottom maybe they could added some

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
bottom maybe they could added some
rubber<00:01:42.000> feet<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> bottom<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.259> thing

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
rubber feet on the bottom but this thing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.399 
rubber feet on the bottom but this thing
packs<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.040> bunch<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> bass<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.689> size<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
packs a bunch of bass for the size and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.929 
packs a bunch of bass for the size and
it's<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> unexpected<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.700> said

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it's kind of unexpected like I said

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
it's kind of unexpected like I said
because<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.600> lightweight<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.619> let's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
because it's very lightweight but let's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.060 
because it's very lightweight but let's
go<00:01:49.860> ahead<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.390> sounds<00:01:51.600> like

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
go ahead and see what this sounds like

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
go ahead and see what this sounds like
so<00:01:53.070> first<00:01:53.310> I'll<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.579> ahead<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.149> play<00:01:54.600> it
