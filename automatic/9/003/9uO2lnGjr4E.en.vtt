but<00:02:27.709> uh<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:28.609> thing<00:02:28.819> barely<00:02:29.000> has<00:02:29.269> any<00:02:29.299> kind<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
but uh this thing barely has any kind of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.589 
but uh this thing barely has any kind of
paint<00:02:30.260> wear<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.859> at<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:32.269> these

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
paint wear on it at all I think these

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.330 
paint wear on it at all I think these
usually<00:02:32.810> get<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> lot<00:02:33.379> of<00:02:33.470> paint<00:02:33.709> wear<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.099> them

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
usually get a lot of paint wear on them

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.390 
usually get a lot of paint wear on them
but<00:02:35.000> uh<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.780> Gallup<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.890> not<00:02:37.040> really<00:02:37.189> sure

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
but uh the Gallup I'm not really sure

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.399 
but uh the Gallup I'm not really sure
how<00:02:37.549> many<00:02:37.609> of<00:02:37.790> these<00:02:37.939> they<00:02:38.180> made<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:39.109> know<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
how many of these they made we know that

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.740 
how many of these they made we know that
Ron<00:02:39.560> bar<00:02:39.739> all<00:02:39.920> got<00:02:40.189> one<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.090> he's<00:02:41.209> pursued<00:02:41.599> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
Ron bar all got one and he's pursued the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.259 
Ron bar all got one and he's pursued the
Trojan<00:02:42.140> horse<00:02:42.379> it<00:02:42.799> can<00:02:43.400> carry<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.700> whole<00:02:43.940> crew

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
Trojan horse it can carry a whole crew

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.399 
Trojan horse it can carry a whole crew
easily<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:46.329> think<00:02:47.329> I<00:02:47.569> didn't<00:02:47.959> actually<00:02:48.109> check

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
easily I think I didn't actually check

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.470 
easily I think I didn't actually check
the<00:02:48.470> Stasi<00:02:48.829> for<00:02:49.159> making<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:49.609> review<00:02:49.849> but<00:02:50.299> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the Stasi for making this review but I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.839 
the Stasi for making this review but I
would<00:02:50.750> say<00:02:50.959> they<00:02:51.139> could<00:02:51.650> easily<00:02:51.980> hold<00:02:52.340> three

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
would say they could easily hold three

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.410 
would say they could easily hold three
mobile<00:02:53.060> suits<00:02:53.889> you<00:02:54.889> know<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.340> thinking<00:02:56.299> if

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
mobile suits you know like thinking if

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.349 
mobile suits you know like thinking if
they<00:02:56.599> were<00:02:56.659> back<00:02:56.959> in<00:02:57.379> there<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:58.430> know<00:02:58.579> but<00:02:59.299> I

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
they were back in there you know but I

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.199 
they were back in there you know but I
think<00:02:59.599> three<00:03:00.079> would<00:03:00.290> be<00:03:00.439> about<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.189> max<00:03:01.430> that

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
think three would be about the max that

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:12.099 
think three would be about the max that
it<00:03:02.359> could<00:03:02.510> hold<00:03:09.700> but<00:03:10.700> uh<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> really

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
it could hold but uh this is a really

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.210 
it could hold but uh this is a really
amazing<00:03:12.409> toy<00:03:12.859> it<00:03:13.549> really<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.449> the<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.440> detail

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
amazing toy it really is the the detail

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.030 
amazing toy it really is the the detail
they<00:03:16.370> put<00:03:16.400> into<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.239> really<00:03:17.660> enjoy<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.379> think

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
they put into it I really enjoy I think

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.189 
they put into it I really enjoy I think
these<00:03:19.459> might<00:03:19.730> even<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.150> rocket<00:03:20.660> launchers

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
these might even be rocket launchers

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.379 
these might even be rocket launchers
right<00:03:21.919> here<00:03:22.220> that's<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:22.879> I<00:03:22.940> think<00:03:23.209> they<00:03:23.359> are

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
right here that's what I think they are

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.649 
right here that's what I think they are
these<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:23.900> jet<00:03:24.109> engines

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
these are jet engines

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.379 
these are jet engines
there's<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:26.840> exhaust<00:03:27.199> these<00:03:27.680> are<00:03:27.889> more<00:03:28.549> these

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
there's the exhaust these are more these

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.479 
there's the exhaust these are more these
are<00:03:29.540> either<00:03:29.659> rear<00:03:30.049> rockets<00:03:30.620> or<00:03:30.949> more<00:03:31.220> jet

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
are either rear rockets or more jet

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.000 
are either rear rockets or more jet
engines<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.230> reason<00:03:33.560> why<00:03:33.650> they<00:03:33.799> might<00:03:33.949> be

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
engines but the reason why they might be

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.129 
engines but the reason why they might be
rockets<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:34.730> why<00:03:35.060> would<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.269> put<00:03:35.569> jet<00:03:35.750> engines

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
rockets is why would you put jet engines

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.780 
rockets is why would you put jet engines
on<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.409> front<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:37.159> know<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:37.459> kind<00:03:37.699> of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
on the front you know that's kind of

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.199 
on the front you know that's kind of
silly

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
silly

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.689 
silly
it<00:03:39.079> would<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:39.440> use<00:03:39.680> its<00:03:39.919> rear<00:03:40.129> propulsion

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
it would just use its rear propulsion

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.969 
it would just use its rear propulsion
which<00:03:40.849> I'm<00:03:41.060> not<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:41.959> front<00:03:42.379> propulsion

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
which I'm not you know front propulsion

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.899 
which I'm not you know front propulsion
this<00:03:43.099> isn't<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.430> space<00:03:43.669> vehicle<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:45.879> but<00:03:46.879> uh

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
this isn't a space vehicle so but uh

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.319 
this isn't a space vehicle so but uh
very<00:03:47.599> cool<00:03:47.870> toy<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.799> guess<00:03:49.010> I'll<00:03:49.329> review

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
very cool toy and I guess I'll review

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.659 
very cool toy and I guess I'll review
the<00:03:52.510> ROM<00:03:53.510> baraka<00:03:54.109> one<00:03:54.379> since<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:55.340> really

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
the ROM baraka one since this really

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.830 
the ROM baraka one since this really
didn't<00:03:55.909> take<00:03:56.120> much<00:03:56.389> time<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.959> review<00:03:58.840> my

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
didn't take much time to review my

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.530 
didn't take much time to review my
maracas<00:04:00.470> one<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.859> great<00:04:01.129> you<00:04:01.729> know<00:04:01.760> he<00:04:02.090> is

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
maracas one is great you know he is

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.119 
maracas one is great you know he is
pretty<00:04:02.840> much<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.079> same<00:04:03.290> duplicate<00:04:03.949> of<00:04:03.979> the

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
pretty much the same duplicate of the

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.390 
pretty much the same duplicate of the
regular<00:04:04.629> Zeon's<00:04:05.629> Ocwen<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.650> head<00:04:06.919> has<00:04:07.099> a

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
regular Zeon's Ocwen you know head has a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.000 
regular Zeon's Ocwen you know head has a
ball<00:04:08.060> joint<00:04:08.299> which<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.810> wish<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.229> Zaku<00:04:09.680> twos

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
ball joint which I wish the Zaku twos

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.740 
ball joint which I wish the Zaku twos
had<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> ball<00:04:10.459> joint<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:11.239> arms<00:04:11.510> are<00:04:11.599> more

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
had a ball joint the arms are more

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.569 
had a ball joint the arms are more
flexible<00:04:11.959> than<00:04:12.409> your<00:04:12.500> standard<00:04:12.680> zaku<00:04:13.220> ii<00:04:13.250> as

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
flexible than your standard zaku ii as

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.520 
flexible than your standard zaku ii as
well<00:04:13.729> you<00:04:14.209> know<00:04:14.299> just<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.959> same<00:04:15.109> as<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.409> other

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
well you know just the same as the other

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.969 
well you know just the same as the other
soccer<00:04:16.130> wand<00:04:16.479> he<00:04:17.479> comes<00:04:17.810> with<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.049> black<00:04:18.409> Zaku

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
soccer wand he comes with a black Zaku

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.770 
soccer wand he comes with a black Zaku
one<00:04:19.159> machine<00:04:19.489> gun<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:20.479> know<00:04:20.570> which<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.079> I

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
one machine gun you know which is not I

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.050 
one machine gun you know which is not I
have<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.109> him<00:04:22.320> at<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.920> moment<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.730> has<00:04:23.910> this

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
have on him at the moment it has this

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.240 
have on him at the moment it has this
really<00:04:24.630> sweet<00:04:25.260> axe

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
really sweet axe

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.400 
really sweet axe
I<00:04:26.280> think<00:04:26.940> only<00:04:27.180> like<00:04:27.389> three<00:04:27.690> Zaku's<00:04:28.139> had

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
I think only like three Zaku's had

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.490 
I think only like three Zaku's had
custom<00:04:28.830> axes<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.810> rumble<00:04:30.810> Rahl<00:04:30.990> was<00:04:31.169> one<00:04:31.380> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
custom axes and rumble Rahl was one of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.600
