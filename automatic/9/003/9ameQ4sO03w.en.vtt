00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello gangsters with you gang where my 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.230
 good old native 2003 i remember that in 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.059
 2003 these models seemed to me quite 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.540
 cool that is good it was 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.390
 for those times for rts graphics now 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.880
 of course they are dumb and we have a review of the hero 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.619
 who probably need to be called 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.939
 morfling in the current version of dota but I'm afraid 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.599
 that it is much different in short it 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.330
 water element 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.920
 an elemental of water called him Jain 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.610
 classical warcraft called him 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.160
 archmage 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.780
 whose hero could be for an alliance 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.730
 tenant in a tavern in the altar of heroes 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.740
 let's go see let's go look at 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.190
 forest creeps what can our element 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.410
 water well I can not eat that is of course 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.060
 amazing card in general of course it 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.250
 morfling but well let's let's see 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.490
 so let's start with ults to the very 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.490
 weak 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.270
 Here is such ulta bone damage why you 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 I was not struck, let's assume that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.870
 everything had to happen in general and so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.410
 the water element makes a hole in the ground roughly 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.760
 speaking before it finishes and slows everyone down 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.180
 units that are near him 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.020
 deals 200 damage and slows enemies to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.370
 50 percent for 15 seconds but ults 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.510
 fast rollback that is she surely is not 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.710
 seemed powerful to me 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.080
 but no less strange, so who suddenly 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.840
 forgot morfling right now ulta completely 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.770
 friend he makes a copy of the hero and the enemy 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.120
 well known to yours then let's try 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.330
 again about tulle because he is very 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.330
 strange 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.640
 contacts 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 Well, 200 damage emity is not very clear 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.780
 me what's the ulta and what's the chip 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.070
 abilities account for 48 of the hand and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.130
 overall okay next skill you too 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.120
 will please this wave of water and on 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.960
 acts so strange acts well and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 actually damash all who this very 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.720
 water will get skill strange skill 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.250
 strange but principle in concept in one 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.790
 characters to stack ie strones 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.660
 also watch dance both goals advice 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:41.760
 therefore it is difficult to just fly and everything is well 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.290
 That's how it remains for tests but 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.250
 This is it I thought that we just did not 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.280
 quickly release one more skill 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.260
 I was very surprised that is elemental 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.270
 the water moves so fast that with 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.880
 it falls all the magical effects and he 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:06.420
 creates 7 illusions to surprise the enemy 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 Well, like this, 6 to 7 instant illusions and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.560
 he moves like that 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 any kind of satanic absolutely 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.400
 skill is the only thing missing is that he 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.290
 Pentagram still laid out themselves just 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 some kind of tin well, mad skill 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.770
 absolutely and another skill hilko 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.030
 here and such hilko of regenerative 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.220
 character so as if on a child 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:41.720
 suspends the this lady can not be saved 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.530
 okay filochko here such before 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.110
 marking first dota first version well 6 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.520
 Prokhazki some kind of tin felt with 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.490
 the balance of course that time was quite 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.680
 badly incomprehensible whale skills and of course 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.030
 dota has changed a lot since then 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.630
 no less I think your interesting 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.220
 look and the seeds here on this circus 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.900
