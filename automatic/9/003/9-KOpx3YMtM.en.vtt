00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 propose to make your own syrup 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 of mint house for this we need 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.000
 a bouquet of mint that is about 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.210
 80 grams once we cut the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.400
 stalks 600 g sugar and 46 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.500
 liters of water the preparation of the syrup is going 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.570
 spread over two days we will start 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.260
 already by boiling water the mint 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.079
 of course we washed the dawn where we go all 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 just pour it directly onto a 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.680
 Mint leaf 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.809
 we're going a little bit all that stuff so that everything 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.440
 the world is well in the water and we 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.289
 covers 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.800
 we will let it go back to temperature 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.960
 ambient 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 once it's good we'll put it on 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.289
 fridge 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.260
 you have to infuse about 24 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.600
 hours our little lie to macerate 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.670
 for 24 hours no we will filter everything 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 that or of course do not expect to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.160
 see something green the real 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.320
 color clues green irony sepa 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.370
 have already done a first filtering in 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.860
 a big pot 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.720
 we crush a little you to do well 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.610
 go out all seen we're going to do a second 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.970
 filtering either in a colander more 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.730
 delicate 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 unless you have a stamen years 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.720
 it admits the filter in a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.310
 stamen it will be even better like that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.450
 in the work really has all the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 small particles or do we see 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.660
 that it's still not very very clear 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:46.330
 now we will add our 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.310
 Herb mass of mint in a saucepan 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.770
 we will add sugar it makes little 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.110
 near as much water as sugar so we 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 will put pretty much we'll say in the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 400 g of sugar but what it remains a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.280
 syrup so inevitably it's very sweet 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.080
 that you can also do at this 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 moment was added the juice of a half 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.410
 lemon is optional but I 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.030
 find it's good it wakes a little the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.770
 taste of mint and we will do 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.900
 heat it will bring to a boil and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.010
 when it bora we will count two minutes 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.110
 and after that will be finished 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.969
 and so now we're going to leave 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.890
 quietly the syrup cool 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.170
 after we put it in a pretty little 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.819
 plastic glass bottle we are going 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.620
 avoid now that the syrup has 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.909
 cooled we will put it in a 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.409
 bottle of small bottles in 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.239
 glass you retrieve the bottles of 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.489
 lemonade to what you want what 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.810
 you have poured with the help of a small 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.510
 funnel it's less dangerous 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 the syrup in the bottle with that one 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.730
 gets pretty much a syrup activist 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.519
 we close it all tightly this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.069
 syrup on the other hand it is preserved 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.200
 refrigerator should be kept pretty much 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.010
 a month a month and a half but still at 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.019
 fridge 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.310
 and if ever really to children where 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.900
 you want neon green syrup like 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.549
 the one we buy you can always 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.489
 add a few drops of dye 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.500
 Food to 6 this will be 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.260
 to taste a small mint with water 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.260
 quiet or in the sun 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.870
