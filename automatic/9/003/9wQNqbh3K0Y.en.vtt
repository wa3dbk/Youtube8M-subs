00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 go to the link that I left in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.480
 description of the video to download the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.939
 nintendo 64 emulator can that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 you say and what am I going to download 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.530
 another emulator if I already have one but this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.829
 emulator is not like the others 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 this is project 64 here 7 is the one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.300
 they need to play online when 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 download the file they go where 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 they kept or where things are saved 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
 they are going to have a rar file 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.829
 called project 64 here 7 war we give 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.829
 Right click and we give you to extract here 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.420
 will leave us a folder with the same 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:07.050
 name open the folder and there they go to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.050
 find the project 64 k 7 open it 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.340
 in case they have a list of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.290
 long games are going to do the following 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.060
 they will go to file and go where it says 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 choose the roms directory 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 a window will appear and there they go 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.939
 choose the emulator folder 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.899
 they will have two games that are mario 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.060
 kart and the smash now to play online 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.280
 we have to go to file and click on 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.189
 where it says to be net play and it's going to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.829
 appear a little window there where it says 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.140
 nick put how they want to call where 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.689
 it says connection setting they put the connection 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.119
 depends on the server if the server has 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.759
 players with land connection you are 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.399
 they blank if they have surplus they 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.769
 they put in excellent they have to do this 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.360
 because for that emulation funke you and 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.480
 the players you are going to play with 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.880
 they must have the same type of connection or 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.340
 it will not affect them well now we 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.519
 we go to where it says master servers ready 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.590
 and they look for a server, I recommend you 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.379
 look for a server from your respective country 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.390
 so that they have less ping in case 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.519
 have found a server that they liked 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.890
 they leave it and they look for it again 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.049
 but do not mess when they have 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.120
 found they click on the server and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.879
 they click there where it says local act 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 seen doing this they will not have it 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.470
 to be looking for and it will disappear in 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.160
 this list is good now I'm going to get 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.160
 to a server 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.880
 where I am where I am I am lost 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.500
 haha not that here I am x of good this 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.050
 number that goes to the right side of your 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.110
 nick is the pin the less pin they have 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.599
 better to less pin depends so much on the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.480
 Internet connection as from distance 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.640
 of the server if they have a chanta connection 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.340
 they will have more pin and they will be more 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.040
 uncomfortable to play if the server is too 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.290
 far too that's why as I said before 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.900
 try to find a server in your country or 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.959
 close to him good now I'm going to tell you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.730
 how to create a game of some game 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.860
 first they go here where they say create 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.519
 and select the game they want to play 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.560
 in my case it will be the smash x of now only 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.709
 we have to wait for someone to enter 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.630
 there someone entered xvii when everything 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.549
 be ready to play you get there in 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.849
 where it says to be to start the 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.849
 emulation 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.090
 there we are already playing here good now 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.120
 I will tell you how to join a game 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.549
 when they see a small game of mario 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.340
 kart that says wait or wait 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.590
 double click to join but now instead 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.239
 of you start the emulation have 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.730
 to wait for the creator of the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.250
 starting start only the creator of the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.129
 game can start emulation there 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.640
 good start as you can see I'm already 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.769
 playing only and that's how it's good 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.500
 I think that was the whole tutorial but 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.900
 there's still more I'll leave a page 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.720
 very good to download called roms 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.850
 with rom dotcom I'll leave it in the 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.340
 video description now for 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.770
 download roms we go there where it says 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.150
 rom files and we put the console to which 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.669
 belongs the game that we want 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.750
 download I want a game of the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.750
 Nintendo 64 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.530
 Well, as you can see, there is a 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.540
 list of games but there is also a 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.400
 alphabet used to locate the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.250
 game that we want to download with more 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.430
 ease in my case I'm going to use 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.350
 example the do not key with 64 I'm going to the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.350
 I search for the game and I click 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.530
 now there is a time that there is 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.350
 wait to download are like 8 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.480
 seconds so be patient xd ya 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.120
 once the time passed we give to 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.360
 where it says town load file to download 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.540
 and we give him to save then they pass it to 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.130
 the emulator folder that we downloaded 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.530
 then they close and open the emulator and 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.270
 press f5 to bring up the game 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.610
 on the list and test if it worked 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.530
 well now I'm going to tell you some 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.950
 things that they have to know when they play 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.440
 on-line 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.480
 when one is playing online in 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.790
 any game comes a moment in the 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.230
 that is synchronized to this is known 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.360
 like ps at least I know him well xd and 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.090
 when that happens normally the other 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.370
 player is doing stupid things in 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.350
 the case of smash when it gives of that 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.690
 normally the other player stays 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.270
 hitting how subnormal to the air or sometimes 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.610
 is pulled alone to the vacuum in the case of 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.740
 mario kart the player stays crashing 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.620
 as subnormal with the walls and sometimes 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.540
 until it goes in reverse x ddr when it hits 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.520
 that emulation must be closed and 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.190
 start playing again 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.919
 and do not confuse leaving the server alone 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.569
 they close the window of the emulation the ds 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.509
 it is inevitable already all the emulators 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.699
 else it happens is when he says of 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.220
 Synchronization detected by the user 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.409
 so much layered this is also 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.330
 inevitable and when it happens there yes that 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.879
 they have to leave the server and go back to 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.409
 enter depends if it happens to you had to 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.349
 do that and if it does not happen to you then 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.330
 just did not do it xdddd otherwise 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.310
 is when they take you out of the game room 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.530
 there could no longer enter the room 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.690
 player game that takes away or less 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.509
 that said player believes starting again 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.759
 well I think that's all nothing but 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.770
 say if you want any doubt tell me and 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.349
 if I feel like it, I 'll answer them 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.360
 I'll say good that's all I hope you 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.529
 has served blessings and many 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.079
 Thank you 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.299
 oh wait, do not change the video 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:03.849
 forgot to tell them something like that I'm going to 

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:06.189
 do before I forget something else is 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.129
 that sometimes you configure the plugins 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.779
 and if he had windows vista windows 7 he's going 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.539
 to say that the emulator stopped 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:15.489
 work this I do not know why it happens I do not know 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.469
 why plugins will be configured 

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:19.329
 so that you do not get that little picture 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.729
 they have to configure the plugins as 

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:23.949
 I show you in the next video as 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.899
 come here I got the picture that goes to 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.569
 solve the problem are going to options 

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:31.509
 and then the configuration is going to 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:33.369
 appear a window like this look 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.969
 that are in the tab plugins 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:38.649
 Once there we will do the following 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:41.229
 in the first one that is the graphics 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:45.449
 let's put the one that says guys 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.449
 directors of 8.1 point 6 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.360
 in the second one that is the audio we're going to 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.170
 put the one that says soaps direct sound 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.170
 1.6 

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.980
 and the third do not do anything I do not know 

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.960
 unconfigured but in case they are 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.640
 unconfigured there they can not see 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.250
 what plugin is the one that they have to put in 

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.410
 case that they are configured and now 

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:15.330
 If this has been all I hope you have 

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.330
 served blessings and thank you very much
