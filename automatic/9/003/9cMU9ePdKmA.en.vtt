00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
and real slowly with the zone let's see

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.039 
and real slowly with the zone let's see
if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:23.930> see<00:03:24.409> through<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:25.010> bushes<00:03:25.280> and

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
if you can see through the bushes and

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.100 
if you can see through the bushes and

up<00:04:05.430> or<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:09.380> she's<00:04:10.380> definitely<00:04:10.680> after

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.760 

now<00:04:21.220> we'll<00:04:21.489> go<00:04:21.669> about<00:04:21.820> cooking<00:04:22.560> keep<00:04:23.560> your

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
now we'll go about cooking keep your

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.610 
now we'll go about cooking keep your
eyes<00:04:23.889> can<00:04:24.370> out<00:04:24.610> there<00:04:25.080> how<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.139> corner<00:04:26.500> of

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
eyes can out there how the corner of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.749 
eyes can out there how the corner of
eyes<00:04:26.919> watch<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:29.650> see<00:04:29.710> if<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.280> moves<00:04:30.520> in

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
eyes watch it and see if it moves in

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.860 
eyes watch it and see if it moves in
closer<00:04:31.060> i<00:04:31.770> should<00:04:32.770> say<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:33.699> you<00:04:34.060> can<00:04:34.330> hear<00:04:34.630> me<00:04:34.690> i

will leave you some food you'll be able
to<00:04:39.370> come<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.639> get<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.060> whenever<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.570> want<00:04:45.030> the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
to come and get it whenever you want the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.129 
to come and get it whenever you want the
donations<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.870> we<00:04:47.020> got<00:04:47.229> we<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:48.780> an<00:04:49.780> alarm

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
donations that we got we have an alarm

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.089 
donations that we got we have an alarm
system<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.190> we<00:04:51.220> can<00:04:51.550> set<00:04:51.789> out<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.120> sensors

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
system so we can set out the sensors

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.730 
system so we can set out the sensors
these<00:04:54.099> are<00:04:54.280> passive<00:04:54.880> sensors<00:04:55.449> in<00:04:56.320> other<00:04:56.440> words

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
these are passive sensors in other words

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.529 
these are passive sensors in other words
they<00:04:56.860> don't<00:04:57.070> omit<00:04:57.460> anything<00:04:57.729> all<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.210> do<00:04:58.509> is

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
they don't omit anything all I do is

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.670 
they don't omit anything all I do is
look<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:58.870> eat<00:04:59.340> and<00:05:00.340> when<00:05:01.120> heat<00:05:01.449> hits<00:05:02.320> the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
look for eat and when heat hits the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.240 
look for eat and when heat hits the
sensor<00:05:03.300> then<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.840> sends<00:05:05.199> out<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.410> signal<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.220> a

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
sensor then it sends out a signal to a

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.499 
sensor then it sends out a signal to a
receiver<00:05:07.020> unless<00:05:08.020> your<00:05:08.320> receiver<00:05:09.389> will<00:05:12.509> this

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
receiver unless your receiver will this

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.540 
receiver unless your receiver will this
is<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.870> receiver<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.900> tells<00:05:17.199> us

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
is the receiver and it tells us

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.909 
is the receiver and it tells us
basically<00:05:19.020> which<00:05:20.020> zone<00:05:20.440> that<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:22.919> now

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
basically which zone that it's in now

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.439 
basically which zone that it's in now
where<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:24.370> can<00:05:24.580> tell<00:05:24.820> when<00:05:25.030> something's

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
where we can tell when something's

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.580 
where we can tell when something's
coming<00:05:25.900> into<00:05:26.139> our<00:05:26.169> camp<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:28.380> we'll<00:05:29.380> be<00:05:29.500> able

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
coming into our camp and we'll be able

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
at them with the camera or something

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.909 
at them with the camera or something
like<00:05:36.699> that<00:05:37.229> but<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:39.220> will<00:05:39.520> give<00:05:39.880> both<00:05:40.919> visual
