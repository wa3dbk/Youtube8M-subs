these so you can see what they are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
these so you can see what they are
unlike<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.040> enable<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.970> entire<00:01:06.630> thing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
unlike you can enable the entire thing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
unlike you can enable the entire thing
you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.350> let<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.560> affect<00:01:08.070> their<00:01:08.250> icons<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.450> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you can let it affect their icons or you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
you can let it affect their icons or you
can<00:01:10.080> let<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.470> affect<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> duck<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.670> take

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
can let it affect the duck so if I take

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
can let it affect the duck so if I take
this<00:01:12.030> off<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.840> affect<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.380> duck<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
this off it would not affect the duck if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
this off it would not affect the duck if
I<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.360> affect<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I take that off it will not affect the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
I take that off it will not affect the
icons<00:01:16.229> now<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.000> couple<00:01:18.330> of
