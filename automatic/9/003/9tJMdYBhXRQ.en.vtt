try<00:00:20.179> out<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:20.630> new<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:22.310> retro<00:00:22.699> synth<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.329> new

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
try out this new the retro synth the new

try out this new the retro synth the new
synth<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.109> comes<00:00:24.349> with<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.740> Logic<00:00:25.159> Pro<00:00:25.189> X

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
synth that it comes with the Logic Pro X

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.769 
synth that it comes with the Logic Pro X
to<00:00:27.050> insert<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:27.589> and<00:00:27.880> there<00:00:28.880> we<00:00:29.029> go<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:29.449> looks

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
to insert that and there we go it looks

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.399 
to insert that and there we go it looks
the<00:00:29.960> works

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:30.409 
the works

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.130 
the works
nobody's<00:00:31.279> gonna<00:00:31.429> disagree<00:00:31.819> with<00:00:32.149> that<00:00:32.180> but

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
nobody's gonna disagree with that but

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.050 
nobody's gonna disagree with that but
does<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.440> sound<00:00:33.710> any<00:00:33.890> good<00:00:34.130> well<00:00:34.370> let's<00:00:34.550> try<00:00:34.760> we

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
does it sound any good well let's try we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.200 
does it sound any good well let's try we
got<00:00:35.210> four<00:00:35.570> synth<00:00:35.990> modes<00:00:36.230> analog<00:00:36.950> sync<00:00:37.880> which

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
got four synth modes analog sync which

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.740 
got four synth modes analog sync which
is<00:00:38.390> a<00:00:38.420> different<00:00:38.900> type<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.280> synthesis

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
is a different type of synthesis

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.810 
is a different type of synthesis
wavetable<00:00:41.750> synth<00:00:41.960> that's<00:00:42.470> nice<00:00:42.740> and<00:00:43.070> also<00:00:43.670> an

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
wavetable synth that's nice and also an

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.050 
wavetable synth that's nice and also an
FM<00:00:44.120> synth<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.690> if<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.320> know<00:00:45.500> any

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
FM synth and if you know any

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.850 
FM synth and if you know any
synthesizers<00:00:47.060> from<00:00:47.360> yesteryear<00:00:48.200> you<00:00:48.530> know

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
synthesizers from yesteryear you know

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.310 
synthesizers from yesteryear you know
that<00:00:49.130> they<00:00:49.340> these<00:00:50.240> all<00:00:50.540> look<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.960> bit<00:00:51.140> like

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
that they these all look a bit like

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.580 
that they these all look a bit like
those<00:00:51.650> old<00:00:51.950> classic<00:00:52.490> synthesizers<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:54.230> let's

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
those old classic synthesizers and let's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.160 
those old classic synthesizers and let's
just<00:00:54.890> go<00:00:55.250> through<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.910> couple<00:00:56.180> presets<00:00:56.810> first

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
just go through a couple presets first

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.680 
just go through a couple presets first
I'm<00:00:57.680> going<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.040> try<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.490> layer<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.570> couple

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
I'm going to try and layer a couple

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.170 
I'm going to try and layer a couple
cents<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.470> make<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.860> really<00:01:01.220> big<00:01:01.700> sounding

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
cents to make that really big sounding

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.980 
cents to make that really big sounding
chord<00:01:03.430> let's<00:01:04.430> start<00:01:04.759> off<00:01:04.939> with<00:01:05.180> maybe<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
chord let's start off with maybe a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.649 
chord let's start off with maybe a
string<00:01:06.500> type<00:01:06.740> sounds<00:01:07.190> bright<00:01:07.430> strings<00:01:07.820> oh<00:01:10.659> wow

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
string type sounds bright strings oh wow

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.850 
string type sounds bright strings oh wow
that<00:01:12.230> was<00:01:12.260> easy

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
that was easy

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.360 
that was easy
what<00:01:13.430> if<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:14.120> adjust<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:18.070> second<00:01:19.070> release

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
what if I just adjust the second release

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:31.030 
what if I just adjust the second release
a<00:01:19.400> bit<00:01:27.010> play<00:01:28.010> there's<00:01:28.250> an<00:01:28.400> octave<00:01:28.729> down<00:01:30.040> no

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
a bit play there's an octave down no

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.930 
a bit play there's an octave down no
that's<00:01:31.310> not<00:01:31.460> gonna<00:01:31.549> work

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
that's not gonna work

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.800 
that's not gonna work
okay<00:01:32.690> that's<00:01:33.820> like<00:01:34.820> through<00:01:35.000> these<00:01:35.210> presets<00:01:35.720> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
okay that's like through these presets a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.120 
okay that's like through these presets a
bit

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
bit

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
bit
or<00:01:38.130> keep<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.550> envelope<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.420> tight<00:01:50.810> this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
or keep the envelope really tight this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
or keep the envelope really tight this
could<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.290> useful<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
could be useful so what I can do now is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.200 
could be useful so what I can do now is
just<00:01:54.240> copy<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.900> setting<00:01:55.410> over<00:01:55.980> here<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just copy this setting over here and if

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.180 
just copy this setting over here and if
I<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:57.480> flick<00:01:57.870> through<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.290> presets<00:01:59.040> again

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
I now flick through the presets again

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.710 
I now flick through the presets again
and<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.550> not<00:02:03.030> find<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.690> looking

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and if I do not find what I'm looking

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.020 
and if I do not find what I'm looking
for<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.530> paste<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.400> old<00:02:05.580> one<00:02:05.760> again

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
for I can just paste the old one again

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:15.190 
for I can just paste the old one again
and<00:02:06.270> we're<00:02:06.480> back<00:02:06.510> at<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.100> liked

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.870 

what<00:02:16.200> does<00:02:16.410> sound<00:02:16.710> big<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.490> start

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
what does sound big so it could be start

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.910 
what does sound big so it could be start
of<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.210> good<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:19.350> do<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.890> two

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
of something good I can do one or two

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.640 
of something good I can do one or two
things<00:02:20.040> now<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.300> copy<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.140> classical

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
things now I can just copy the classical

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
things now I can just copy the classical
the<00:02:22.980> classical<00:02:23.490> piano<00:02:23.760> part<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.780> just

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the classical piano part that we just

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.260 
the classical piano part that we just
recorded<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.280> there's<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.580> couple<00:02:26.910> notes<00:02:27.030> in

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
recorded but there's a couple notes in

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.060 
recorded but there's a couple notes in
there<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.630> do<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> synth

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
there that I do not want in the synth

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.910 
there that I do not want in the synth
part<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.300> I'm<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.660> gonna<00:02:30.900> rerecord<00:02:31.470> this

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
part so I'm just gonna rerecord this

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.220 
part so I'm just gonna rerecord this
sometimes<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:32.580> faster<00:02:33.060> right<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:34.140> we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
sometimes that's faster right so here we

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:52.600 
sometimes that's faster right so here we
go

going<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.610> quickly<00:03:11.940> adjust<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.630> length<00:03:12.900> of

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
going to quickly adjust the length of

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.440 
going to quickly adjust the length of
these<00:03:13.230> notes<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.580> want<00:03:14.760> them<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.150> same

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
these notes and I want them the same

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.020 
these notes and I want them the same
lengths<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.160> way<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
lengths and the way to do that it's the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.390 
lengths and the way to do that it's the
same<00:03:18.240> as<00:03:18.450> with<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.630> velocity<00:03:19.290> if<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:19.890> hit

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
same as with the velocity if I just hit

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.360 
same as with the velocity if I just hit
option<00:03:20.940> shift<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:25.020> drag<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> mean<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
option shift and then drag a mean and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.240 
option shift and then drag a mean and
out<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.760> they're<00:03:27.240> all<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.840> same<00:03:28.010> let's<00:03:29.010> say

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
out and they're all the same let's say

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.630 
out and they're all the same let's say
that<00:03:29.430> they're<00:03:29.640> all<00:03:30.530> different<00:03:31.530> lengths<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
that they're all different lengths to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.780 
that they're all different lengths to
select<00:03:32.970> them<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.270> click<00:03:34.080> one<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:35.550> want<00:03:35.730> to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.610 
select them all click one you want to
hold<00:03:35.970> option<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.570> shift<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.470> go

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
hold option and shift and there you go

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.270 
hold option and shift and there you go
see<00:03:38.090> all<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.420> same<00:03:39.630> length<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:42.920> want<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.130> the

see all the same length I want to do the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.390 
see all the same length I want to do the
same<00:03:44.550> with<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.330> chord<00:03:45.840> oh<00:03:46.110> wait<00:03:47.070> there's<00:03:47.310> a

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
just grab these highest notes all of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.180 
just grab these highest notes all of
them<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.990> want<00:04:26.199> to<00:04:26.290> see<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.680> sounds<00:04:27.040> any

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.550 

that's<00:04:36.760> not<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.210> one<00:04:42.870> now<00:04:43.870> that's<00:04:44.110> not<00:04:44.380> what<00:04:44.410> I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
that's not the one now that's not what I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.680 
that's not the one now that's not what I
had<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.830> mind<00:04:44.979> let's<00:04:45.250> delete<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.639> and<00:04:46.000> let's

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
had in mind let's delete that and let's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.629 
had in mind let's delete that and let's
go<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.169> next<00:04:47.350> video<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.950> see<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.310> we<00:04:48.430> can

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
go to the next video and see if we can

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.969 
go to the next video and see if we can
find<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:49.150> second<00:04:49.840> synth<00:04:50.080> with<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> slightly

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
find a second synth with a slightly

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.680 
find a second synth with a slightly
different<00:04:51.460> sound<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:52.330> lay<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.660> top

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
different sound that we can lay on top

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.900 
different sound that we can lay on top
of<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.139> so<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.710> can<00:04:53.950> act<00:04:54.160> as<00:04:54.280> these

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
of this so that it can act as these

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.510 
of this so that it can act as these
higher<00:04:55.150> notes
