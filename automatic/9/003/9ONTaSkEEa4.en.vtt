00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
structure of the tune like the way it

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.060

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the verse a lot of times to let the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.940 
the verse a lot of times to let the
music<00:02:34.940> breathe<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.690> know<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.050> space<00:02:36.530> and
