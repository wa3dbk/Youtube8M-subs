of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> cases<00:01:52.590> we're<00:01:52.860> getting<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.700> have

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
of the cases we're getting don't have

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.219 
of the cases we're getting don't have
the<00:01:54.000> slot<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> microphone<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.110> when

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the slot for the microphone so when

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
the slot for the microphone so when
you're<00:01:55.350> doing<00:01:55.560> some<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> stuff<00:01:55.979> people

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you're doing some of the stuff people

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
can't because they're covering it up so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
can't because they're covering it up so
we'll<00:02:00.329> slide<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.920> sure<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> all

first I was a little bit I was a little

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.740 
first I was a little bit I was a little
bit<00:02:12.100> concerned<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.150> way<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> edges<00:02:13.660> were

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
bit concerned the way the edges were

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.360 
bit concerned the way the edges were
fitting<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.350> as<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.160> I'm<00:02:15.280> gonna

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.360 
take this off live and we do all this
live<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.720> strappy<00:02:19.720> loose

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370

thing<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:23.050> know<00:02:23.230> I'd<00:02:23.680> expect<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.250> a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
thing I don't know I'd expect to be a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.710 
thing I don't know I'd expect to be a
little<00:02:24.459> tighter<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> little<00:02:25.450> clips

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720

little tighter I like the little clips
that<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.200> some<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.440> other<00:02:26.590> cases

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
that we do on some of the other cases

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.740 
that we do on some of the other cases
the<00:02:27.010> other<00:02:27.160> Belkin<00:02:27.550> cases<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.270> well<00:02:28.510> have

the other Belkin cases as well have

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750 
the other Belkin cases as well have
these<00:02:28.870> nice<00:02:29.050> snap-on<00:02:29.590> clips<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.580> made

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
but that's just a little cumbersome now

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.220 
but that's just a little cumbersome now
something<00:02:36.010> else<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.370> note<00:02:36.870> camera<00:02:37.870> hole<00:02:38.019> lines

up<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.209> microphone<00:02:40.209> hole<00:02:40.450> lines<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
up the microphone hole lines up and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.350 
up the microphone hole lines up and
you'll<00:02:42.010> notice<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.430> way<00:02:42.519> this<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.820> done<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you'll notice the way this is done and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.180 
you'll notice the way this is done and
I'm<00:02:43.450> gonna<00:02:43.570> zoom<00:02:44.019> in<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.200> little<00:02:44.350> bit<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit is it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.890 
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit is it
just<00:02:45.519> doesn't<00:02:45.730> cover<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.239> camera<00:02:46.540> hole<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
just doesn't cover the camera hole so it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.270 
just doesn't cover the camera hole so it
doesn't<00:02:47.170> wrap<00:02:47.320> around<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.739> top<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.160> way

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280

that<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:43.150> for<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.420> keyboard<00:03:43.570> itself<00:03:44.109> we

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
that now for the keyboard itself we

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.960 
that now for the keyboard itself we
found<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.650> comfortable<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.459> keys<00:03:45.640> are<00:03:45.790> pretty

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
found it comfortable the keys are pretty

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.460 
found it comfortable the keys are pretty
wide<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.420> well<00:03:46.540> spaced<00:03:46.900> out<00:03:47.079> they're<00:03:47.320> not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.140 
wide and well spaced out they're not
backlit<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.280> keep<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.790> mind<00:03:48.940> if<00:03:49.030> you're

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
power of course syncing it was simple it

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.729

days<00:04:28.880> after<00:04:29.510> we<00:04:29.630> did<00:04:29.780> some<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.110> testing

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
days after we did some of the testing

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.440 
days after we did some of the testing
with<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:31.460> doesn't<00:04:31.700> have<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.060> Smart<00:04:32.330> Cover

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
with it it doesn't have the Smart Cover

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.350 
with it it doesn't have the Smart Cover
add<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.140> off<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.920> as<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.160> can<00:04:34.310> see<00:04:34.610> and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
add on and off and as you can see and

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.460 
add on and off and as you can see and
this<00:04:35.480> is<00:04:35.600> kind<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.810> interesting<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.290> don't<00:04:36.410> know

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
this is kind of interesting I don't know

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.750 
this is kind of interesting I don't know
how<00:04:36.560> well<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.860> will<00:04:37.010> show<00:04:37.160> up<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> camera

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
how well this will show up on the camera

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.400 
how well this will show up on the camera
but<00:04:38.150> there's<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.360> little<00:04:38.570> bit<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.810> gap<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.320> the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
but there's a little bit of a gap in the

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.440 
but there's a little bit of a gap in the
way<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.800> bends<00:04:40.040> right<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:41.210> where<00:04:41.360> the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
way that it bends right there where the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.910 
way that it bends right there where the
keyboard<00:04:41.630> is<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.320> has<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> little<00:04:42.650> bit<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.830> a

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
keyboard is so it has a little bit of a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.710 
keyboard is so it has a little bit of a
gap<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.400> would<00:04:43.700> have<00:04:43.820> loved<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> seen<00:04:44.330> some<00:04:44.570> sort

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
gap I would have loved to seen some sort

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.170 
gap I would have loved to seen some sort
of<00:04:44.840> strap<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.350> keep<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.740> shut<00:04:46.010> be<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:46.850> fold

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
of strap to keep this shut be it a fold

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.700 
of strap to keep this shut be it a fold
over<00:04:47.360> strap<00:04:47.690> or<00:04:47.840> something<00:04:47.870> else<00:04:48.320> as<00:04:48.560> an

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
over strap or something else as an

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.680 
over strap or something else as an

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
have to just use it for the iPad per se

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.450 
have to just use it for the iPad per se
now<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.590> other<00:05:24.770> part<00:05:24.980> they<00:05:25.100> wanted<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.370> to

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
now the other part they wanted you to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.090 
now the other part they wanted you to
point<00:05:25.670> out<00:05:25.820> is<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:27.230> can<00:05:27.470> fold<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> backwards

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
point out is you can fold it backwards

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.070 
point out is you can fold it backwards
behind<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:28.910> hold<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.510> what<00:05:29.720> does<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:29.870> do

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
behind it and hold it what does it do

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.960 
behind it and hold it what does it do
though<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.350> makes<00:05:30.500> one<00:05:30.830> side<00:05:31.130> thicker<00:05:31.550> so

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
though it makes one side thicker so

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.940 
though it makes one side thicker so
matter<00:05:32.150> what<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.510> do<00:05:32.720> this<00:05:33.320> side<00:05:33.620> where<00:05:33.860> you

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
matter what you do this side where you

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.470 
matter what you do this side where you
fold<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.370> will<00:05:34.520> be<00:05:34.669> thicker<00:05:34.940> when<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.150> hold<00:05:35.330> it

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
fold it will be thicker when you hold it

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.909 
fold it will be thicker when you hold it
but<00:05:35.660> it<00:05:35.750> lets<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:35.990> still<00:05:36.230> use<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.680> portrait

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
but it lets you still use it in portrait
