 Norbert Gastell is the German dubbing voice of hamas fighters 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.819
 since the series was first shown in Germany in 1991 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.800
 with his broad repertoire of baritone should be hoarse 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.419
 Kieksen he even goes with many German-speaking fans of the series as 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.429
 better than the original 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.189
 maybe it's because of Dell's love for his yellow alter ego that I was giving 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.890
 he gave his species but the Eldorado for a short time in depth as 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.150

 For over 15 years, the voice was skepticism of many fans could Engelke 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.530
 however, disperse quickly to be too late in 5 neither in the series nor at the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.289
 Movie she tries to imitate Volkmann
