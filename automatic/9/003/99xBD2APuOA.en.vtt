and<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.530> running<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.540> at<00:01:51.540> this

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and see how far it's running out at this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
and see how far it's running out at this
stage<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> game<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> little

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
stage of the game well you see a little

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
stage of the game well you see a little
bit<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.460> run-out<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> part<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.930> let's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
bit of run-out in the part now let's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730 
bit of run-out in the part now let's
dial<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> machine<00:01:56.909> surface<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.590> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
dial in that machine surface that we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.050 
dial in that machine surface that we
machined<00:01:59.100> earlier<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.939> our<00:02:00.000> test<00:02:00.719> part

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.820 

back<00:02:09.060> our<00:02:09.270> cross-feed<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.080> we'll<00:02:10.440> take<00:02:10.649> our

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
back our cross-feed out we'll take our

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.880 
back our cross-feed out we'll take our
dial<00:02:11.070> indicator<00:02:12.050> set<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.320> our<00:02:13.470> machine

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
dial indicator set it on our machine

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.510 
dial indicator set it on our machine
surface<00:02:14.610> pre<00:02:15.600> mode<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.990> dial<00:02:16.200> indicator<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
surface pre mode the dial indicator you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.340 
surface pre mode the dial indicator you
always<00:02:17.970> want<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> amount<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
always want to do that for the amount of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.620 
always want to do that for the amount of
run-out<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:20.250> we're<00:02:20.400> dealing<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:20.790> we'll

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
run-out that we're dealing with we'll

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.140 
run-out that we're dealing with we'll
rotate<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.350> Chuck<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.790> see<00:02:24.000> we've

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
rotate the Chuck all right we see we've

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
rotate the Chuck all right we see we've
got<00:02:24.240> about<00:02:24.450> four<00:02:24.810> thousandths<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.650> total

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
got about four thousandths of total

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.300 
got about four thousandths of total
indicated<00:02:26.790> run<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.690> our<00:02:27.750> Chuck<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:28.800> let's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
indicated run out on our Chuck now let's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.850 
indicated run out on our Chuck now let's
adjust<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.970> out<00:02:30.170> you'll<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> smaller

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
adjust that out you'll see the smaller

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.300 
adjust that out you'll see the smaller
hex<00:02:32.820> screws<00:02:33.630> located<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> Chuck<00:02:34.920> scroll

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

tighten those respectively in order to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.370 
tighten those respectively in order to
dial<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.530> part<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.750> were<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.020> machine

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
dial in this part if we were to machine

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
dial in this part if we were to machine
it<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:44.130> important<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> place<00:02:44.970> our<00:02:45.239> dial

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it it's important to place our dial

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.410 
it it's important to place our dial
indicator<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.440> either<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.250> 12<00:02:47.550> o'clock<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.209> 9

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
indicator in either the 12 o'clock or 9

indicator in either the 12 o'clock or 9
o'clock<00:02:48.450> position<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.040> work<00:02:50.220> part<00:02:50.520> that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
o'clock position on the work part that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060 
o'clock position on the work part that
we're<00:02:50.850> doing<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.959> rotate<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.770> Chuck

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
we're doing so as we rotate the Chuck

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.550 
we're doing so as we rotate the Chuck
and<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.820> watch<00:02:54.060> our<00:02:54.330> dial<00:02:54.570> indicator<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.380> can

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and we watch our dial indicator we can

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
and we watch our dial indicator we can
make<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> necessary<00:02:56.100> adjustments<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:58.050> will

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
make the necessary adjustments that will

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.949 
make the necessary adjustments that will
affect<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.070> location<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.060> part<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
affect the location of that part in the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.350 
affect the location of that part in the
Chuck<00:03:01.260> alright<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.489> rotate<00:03:02.880> our<00:03:03.030> Chuck

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
Chuck alright so as we rotate our Chuck

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.509 
Chuck alright so as we rotate our Chuck
we're<00:03:03.600> looking<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> high<00:03:04.350> spot<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
we're looking for the high spot on the

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.180 
we're looking for the high spot on the
Chuck<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> seems<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.410> number<00:03:07.739> 4<00:03:07.980> so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
Chuck and now it seems to be number 4 so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.400 
Chuck and now it seems to be number 4 so
we<00:03:08.280> align<00:03:08.519> number<00:03:08.850> 4<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.300> at<00:03:09.450> 12<00:03:09.720> o'clock<00:03:10.080> on

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
we align number 4 up at 12 o'clock on

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.250 
we align number 4 up at 12 o'clock on
our<00:03:10.980> Chuck<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:12.120> going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.330> break<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
our Chuck we're going to break that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400 
our Chuck we're going to break that
loose<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.600> now<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> we've<00:03:16.230> taken

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
loose you can see now that we've taken

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.560 
loose you can see now that we've taken
about<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.799> thousand<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> half<00:03:17.519> out<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.239> our

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
about a thousand a half out of our

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.990 
about a thousand a half out of our
run-out<00:03:18.989> okay<00:03:19.470> number<00:03:19.769> one<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.340> showing<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.790> low

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
run-out okay number one is showing a low

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.080 
run-out okay number one is showing a low
spot<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.170> we're<00:03:22.470> gonna<00:03:22.560> tweak<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.579> just<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
spot so we're gonna tweak that in just a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:33.050 
spot so we're gonna tweak that in just a
little<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:30.560> okay<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.590> number<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.250> again<00:03:32.700> is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
little bit okay and number one again is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:44.590 
little bit okay and number one again is
just<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.810> couple<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.260> tenths<00:03:34.500> low<00:03:39.260> number<00:03:40.260> four

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.880 

okay<00:03:45.600> now<00:03:45.780> when<00:03:45.930> you're<00:03:46.049> diving<00:03:46.230> into<00:03:46.650> part

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
okay now when you're diving into part

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.890 
okay now when you're diving into part
two<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.370> need<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.549> keep<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.000> mind<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.450> surface

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
two you need to keep in mind the surface

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.500 
two you need to keep in mind the surface
finish<00:03:49.110> if<00:03:49.829> we've<00:03:50.070> got<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> very<00:03:50.489> coarse<00:03:50.940> finish

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
finish if we've got a very coarse finish

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.300 
finish if we've got a very coarse finish
on<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.350> part<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.860> going<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.130> very

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
on the part it's going to be very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.729 
on the part it's going to be very
difficult<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.420> dial<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.200> part<00:03:55.470> in

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
difficult for you to dial the part in

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.890 
difficult for you to dial the part in
any<00:03:55.980> finer<00:03:56.340> than<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.820> particular<00:03:57.030> finish

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
any finer than the particular finish

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.250 
any finer than the particular finish
that<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.829> have<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.549> the<00:04:00.090> part<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:00.989> want<00:04:01.200> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
that you have on the part so you want to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.410
