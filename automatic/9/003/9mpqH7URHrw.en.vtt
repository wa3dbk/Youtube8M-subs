00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
okay so the first couple things i have

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.950 
okay so the first couple things i have
to<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:59.219> off<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.329> resolution<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to go over first off the resolution on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.280 
to go over first off the resolution on
your<00:01:01.079> gopro<00:01:01.440> camera<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> quite<00:01:02.219> important<00:01:02.699> um

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
your gopro camera is quite important um

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.700 
your gopro camera is quite important um
if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> GoPro<00:01:05.100> Hero<00:01:05.129> 1<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> probably

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
if you have a GoPro Hero 1 you probably

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.270 
if you have a GoPro Hero 1 you probably
want<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> set<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> resolution

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
want to set it on the on the resolution

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.230 
want to set it on the on the resolution
4<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.380> 960<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.729> widest

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
4 or the 960 because it is the widest

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
4 or the 960 because it is the widest
angle<00:01:15.420> shot<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> GoPro<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.950> also<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
angle shot on the GoPro it's also a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.359 
angle shot on the GoPro it's also a
taller<00:01:18.450> shot<00:01:18.869> which<00:01:19.200> means<00:01:19.439> it'll<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.799> easier

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
taller shot which means it'll be easier

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.840 
taller shot which means it'll be easier
to<00:01:20.400> capture<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to capture more of you so that's the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
to capture more of you so that's the
first<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.450> make<00:01:24.689> sure<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.650> 960

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
first one will be make sure you use 960

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
first one will be make sure you use 960
especially<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> hero<00:01:27.630> 1<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.799> hero<00:01:29.009> -

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
especially on the hero 1 on the hero -

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.940 
especially on the hero 1 on the hero -
it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.299> important<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.259> all<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's not as important because all of the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
it's not as important because all of the
shot<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.090> resolutions<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:34.110> use

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
shot or all of the resolutions can use

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.640 
shot or all of the resolutions can use
the<00:01:34.650> wide<00:01:34.920> setting<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> hero<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
the wide setting so you're on a hero to

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.420 
the wide setting so you're on a hero to
make<00:01:37.650> sure<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> wide<00:01:38.939> setting

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
make sure that you use the wide setting

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
make sure that you use the wide setting
but<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.610> still<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.079> idea<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
but I still think it's a good idea to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
but I still think it's a good idea to
use<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> 960<00:01:44.159> setting<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
use a 960 setting it's just it's a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
use a 960 setting it's just it's a
taller<00:01:45.479> shot<00:01:45.840> especially<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.009> using

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
taller shot especially if you're using

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
taller shot especially if you're using
it<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> self<00:01:47.729> portrait<00:01:47.939> shot<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.540> skiing

or snowboarding the 960 I think is a
better<00:01:51.899> way<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.060> second<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.630> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
better way to go the second one would be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.719 
better way to go the second one would be

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
because it's nice and small and I take

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.940 
because it's nice and small and I take
it<00:02:57.690> everywhere<00:02:57.900> whatever<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.560> skiing<00:02:58.830> it's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it everywhere whatever I go skiing it's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.140 
it everywhere whatever I go skiing it's
in<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.220> pocket<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.850> my<00:02:59.940> backpack

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
in my back pocket it's in my backpack

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.910 
in my back pocket it's in my backpack
and<00:03:00.570> then<00:03:00.870> once<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.770> mount<00:03:01.950> my<00:03:02.010> GoPro<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:03.920> tighten

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and then once I mount my GoPro I tighten

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.610 
and then once I mount my GoPro I tighten
down<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.370> mouth<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.960> there's<00:03:07.170> no<00:03:07.410> way

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
down the mouth and then there's no way

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.130 
down the mouth and then there's no way
the<00:03:07.800> camera<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.280> move<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:10.020> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the camera can move so this is this is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.230 
the camera can move so this is this is
just<00:03:10.290> nicer<00:03:10.680> especially<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> pole

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
just nicer especially for the pole

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.450 
just nicer especially for the pole
because<00:03:12.450> once<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.750> get<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.990> set<00:03:13.260> somewhere<00:03:13.680> for

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
because once I get it set somewhere for

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.360 
because once I get it set somewhere for
the<00:03:14.550> angle<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.850> want<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.720> won't<00:03:16.110> change<00:03:16.710> angle

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the angle I want it won't change angle

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.940 
the angle I want it won't change angle
so<00:03:17.910> big<00:03:18.450> thing<00:03:18.720> get<00:03:19.170> your<00:03:19.320> screwdriver<00:03:19.560> and
