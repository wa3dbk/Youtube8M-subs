retracted in this way you open those
those<00:02:15.739> shoes<00:02:16.040> up<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.910> rear<00:02:23.150> rotors<00:02:23.690> are<00:02:23.930> not

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
those shoes up the rear rotors are not

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.160 
those shoes up the rear rotors are not
directional<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.819> same<00:02:26.060> part<00:02:26.359> number<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
directional the same part number for the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.229 
directional the same part number for the
left<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.470> right<00:02:27.680> side<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.100> vehicle<00:02:28.280> the

left and right side of the vehicle the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.099 
left and right side of the vehicle the
vanes

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
vanes

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.809 
vanes
the<00:02:30.500> parts<00:02:30.799> in<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> center<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.519> rotors

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
the parts in the center of the rotors

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.000 
the parts in the center of the rotors
are<00:02:32.000> straight<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.900> comes<00:02:33.170> straight<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.799> from

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
are straight it comes straight up from

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.520 
are straight it comes straight up from
the<00:02:34.040> center<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.750> way<00:02:36.290> there's<00:02:36.470> no

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the center so that way there's no

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:55.590 
the center so that way there's no
difference<00:02:37.100> for<00:02:37.959> which<00:02:38.959> way<00:02:39.139> to<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.440> rotate

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.510 

now<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.660> remember<00:02:56.960> that<00:02:57.080> adjuster<00:02:57.620> was<00:02:58.340> in

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
now you remember that adjuster was in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.360 
now you remember that adjuster was in
here<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.390> adjuster<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.920> through<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.100> hole

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
here the adjuster is through this hole

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.110 
here the adjuster is through this hole
that<00:03:01.940> little<00:03:02.240> that<00:03:03.020> little<00:03:03.730> gear<00:03:04.730> looking

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that little that little gear looking

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.440 
that little that little gear looking
part<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.340> little<00:03:07.520> turnbuckle

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
part so I have that little turnbuckle

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.780 
part so I have that little turnbuckle
that<00:03:08.570> adjuster<00:03:08.990> fully<00:03:09.350> compressed<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that adjuster fully compressed so the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.970 
that adjuster fully compressed so the
shoes<00:03:11.090> are<00:03:11.330> all<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.600> way<00:03:11.690> together<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:12.830> going

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
shoes are all the way together I'm going

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.980 
shoes are all the way together I'm going
to<00:03:13.070> start<00:03:13.340> turning<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.940> out<00:03:14.120> until<00:03:14.480> those

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
to start turning that out until those

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.640 
to start turning that out until those
shoes<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:16.340> start<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.730> touch<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.210> outside<00:03:17.690> or

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
shoes just start to touch the outside or

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.560 
shoes just start to touch the outside or
you<00:03:18.890> know<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.130> inside<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.210> rotor<00:03:20.390> they

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
you know the inside of the rotor they

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.850 
you know the inside of the rotor they
just<00:03:20.720> start<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.900> touch<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.320> middle<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.710> the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
just start to touch the middle of the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.670 
just start to touch the middle of the
rotor<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.060> starts<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.600> make<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.960> hard

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
rotor so that it starts to make it hard

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.340 
rotor so that it starts to make it hard
to<00:03:24.770> turn<00:03:25.100> at<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.030> point<00:03:26.630> I'm<00:03:26.870> going<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.110> back

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
to turn at that point I'm going to back

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.700 
to turn at that point I'm going to back
it<00:03:27.590> off<00:03:27.800> for<00:03:28.580> clicks<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.750> adjuster<00:03:30.290> and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
it off for clicks on the adjuster and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:04:03.220 
it off for clicks on the adjuster and
that<00:03:31.130> parking<00:03:31.370> brake<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.790> going<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.000> be<00:03:32.120> set<00:04:02.230> so

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
that parking brake is going to be set so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.020 
that parking brake is going to be set so
I'm<00:04:03.290> getting<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.620> drag<00:04:04.070> right<00:04:04.430> there

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
I'm getting some drag right there

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:14.920 
I'm getting some drag right there
do<00:04:06.020> one<00:04:06.230> more<00:04:06.260> click<00:04:06.650> here<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:13.630> can't<00:04:14.630> move<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
do one more click here I can't move it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.590 
do one more click here I can't move it
anymore<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:16.310> pretty<00:04:16.670> it's<00:04:17.120> pretty<00:04:17.180> tight

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
anymore it's pretty it's pretty tight

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.540 
anymore it's pretty it's pretty tight
there<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.560> now<00:04:20.110> I'm<00:04:21.110> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> loosen<00:04:22.220> that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
there so now I'm going to loosen that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:44.790 
there so now I'm going to loosen that
adjuster<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.720> clicks

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:55.630 

one<00:04:46.450> two<00:04:48.010> three<00:04:50.830> four

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.820 

just<00:04:56.640> right

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.490 

make<00:05:02.610> sure<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:02.970> replace<00:05:03.330> your<00:05:03.539> caliper<00:05:04.080> bolts

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
make sure you replace your caliper bolts

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.960 
make sure you replace your caliper bolts
and<00:05:04.650> torque<00:05:05.129> them<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.460> 63<00:05:06.180> foot-pounds
