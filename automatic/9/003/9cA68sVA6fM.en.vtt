area<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.750> need<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> rehearse<00:00:19.170> with

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
area you really do need to rehearse with

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
area you really do need to rehearse with
and<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> course<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> audio<00:00:21.090> systems

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and that of course is the audio systems

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
and that of course is the audio systems
as<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.840> well<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.010> demand<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
as you well know the demand for the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.939 
as you well know the demand for the
sophistication<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.289> hardware<00:00:25.650> has

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
sophistication of this hardware has

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.490 
sophistication of this hardware has
become<00:00:26.310> quite<00:00:26.519> great<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.840> end<00:00:28.109> something

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
become quite great to that end something

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
become quite great to that end something
I<00:00:28.769> love<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.369> love<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.179> refer<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> as

this stuff rating your thumbs this is
good<00:00:40.050> stuff<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> admit<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> what

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
good stuff now I admit if this is what

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.260 
good stuff now I admit if this is what
you<00:00:42.090> call<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.570> driving<00:00:43.170> position<00:00:44.090> well<00:00:45.090> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you call a driving position well this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
you call a driving position well this
isn't<00:00:45.480> important<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.079> anyway<00:00:46.410> because

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
isn't important to you anyway because

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
isn't important to you anyway because
you've<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.250> crashes<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> deal<00:00:48.059> with

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you've got other crashes to deal with

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
you've got other crashes to deal with
but<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> pay<00:00:49.110> attention<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.070> good

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
but if you pay attention this is good

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
but if you pay attention this is good
