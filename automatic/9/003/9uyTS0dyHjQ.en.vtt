00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 nice guys here i am here with a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.250
 new video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 then guys the video of what I am 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.690
 bringing this evening really is 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 unbelievable absurd I don't really have 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.670
 words today clash with that of a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.379
 very famous youtube dog has 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 published a video of this person 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 which is sifting the broken all binds 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 titan with the town hall level 2 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.199
 maybe many of you will have seen but for 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.939
 the many who have not seen a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.699
 place to make this video 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.430
 this person is called pelican tacos Ã¨ 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.640
 arrived these days anyway I think 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.800
 today or in any case yesterday to 3800 cups with the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.040
 that is, municipality level two 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 I won't even tell you guys 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 how far behind it must be 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 even if coming to his video not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 let's say it doesn't find many municipalities max 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 ati but find municipi ii iii say 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.219
 all municipalities quite low e 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 this is given by the matchmaking of 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 clash of plants that has changed in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.470
 latest updates then find 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 we say very few municipalities 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.010
 without a league that manages to attack a lot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 easily 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 so now I don't know how much he can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.729
 play every day because it really does 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 he found so many I saw almost 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.290
 those are almost exclusively though 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 really a business to get to 3800 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.320
 cups with a town hall ii 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 that is, I think it is unthinkable 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 incredible at the same time because 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 even if he finds many of these 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.329
 municipalities will definitely have to look 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.829
 endless of time because I am 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.710
 Town hall at 9 I find municipi at 10 there is 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 we always say even without we say that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
 i can say skippare i think he 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.640
 must stay with an infinite amount of time 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.229
 until you find one of those municipalities 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 without league because he cannot find the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 obviously bronze town halls standing in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.820
 april 1800 cups so I don't imagine the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.619
 skip time I must have there 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.509
 I will leave the link to his channel 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.250
 indiscretion went to see him because I have 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.290
 seen before a 22 minute video 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.570
 obviously 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.220
 going from one piece to another not 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.980
 do you ever want to see you 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.230
 shows lots of replays that he does 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.480
 but it's not just the municipalities outside and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.980
 I really when I went to see 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.250
 I said ok, all the municipalities will be 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.900
 outside damage in a corner and hoping 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.970
 however, never to find a tense 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.070
 dwarfs nothing because it attacks him with 30 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 archers or at least 30 barbarians 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.240
 zero level archers then a thesis 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.540
 from boys at level 7 oct but a 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.260
 anything and let's say liszt ends 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.520
 so he surely says pop 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.070
 until it finds one of these municipalities 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.650
 scarce without alloy and then attack it e 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.050
 not always only a few trophies but 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.670
 I have also seen times when it is 14 20 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.870
 trophies 15 trophies 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.520
 so I will surely leave you in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.340
 description I decided to do this 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.680
 video because we say amazing how 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.650
 so what I wanted I wanted to do it for you 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.870
 know that a very person we say 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.340
 sane has decided to do this 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.700
 what I'll definitely show you 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
 some images will not place pieces of you 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.810
 video because we have it anyway 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.030
 asked for some screenshots I don't think if 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.910
 take it or rather let's say it 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.900
 hint of zhu a little bit so not 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.150
 you're a day will see this video 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.709
 surely you will not be able to complain e 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.570
 no guys i hope this 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.790
 AB index information liked 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.250
 Below you repeat the passes from its 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.660
 channel because it really makes you videos 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.030
 let's say where it shows all this 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.280
 climb up to Titan which is 4,300 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.140
 cups guys left a nice comment 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.360
 let me know what you think of this 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.709
