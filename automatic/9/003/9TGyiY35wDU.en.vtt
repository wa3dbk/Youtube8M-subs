00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
the point where was hurting my ears just

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.449

are designed to convert 7.1 surround
sound<00:05:41.199> so<00:05:42.130> we<00:05:42.220> can<00:05:42.370> go<00:05:42.490> into<00:05:42.699> your<00:05:42.820> two

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
sound so we can go into your two

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.830 
sound so we can go into your two
speakers<00:05:43.720> in<00:05:44.050> your<00:05:44.560> headphones<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.270> send<00:05:46.539> a

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
speakers in your headphones so to send a

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.250 
speakers in your headphones so to send a
stereo<00:05:47.380> signal<00:05:48.060> through<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.090> 7.1<00:05:50.020> surround

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
stereo signal through the 7.1 surround

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.899 
stereo signal through the 7.1 surround
sound<00:05:50.470> software<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.280> just<00:05:51.520> going<00:05:51.639> to<00:05:51.699> make<00:05:51.880> it

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
sound software is just going to make it

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.659 
sound software is just going to make it
sound<00:05:52.240> even<00:05:52.659> worse<00:05:53.169> so<00:05:54.070> what<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.280> need<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.460> do

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
sound even worse so what you need to do

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.330 
sound even worse so what you need to do
is<00:05:54.940> set<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.419> 7.1<00:05:55.930> surround<00:05:56.080> sound<00:05:56.349> so<00:05:57.250> you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
is set it to 7.1 surround sound so you

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.800 
is set it to 7.1 surround sound so you
basically<00:05:57.669> need<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.909> trick<00:05:58.180> windows<00:05:58.510> into

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
basically need to trick windows into

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.930 
basically need to trick windows into
thinking<00:05:59.199> you<00:05:59.740> have<00:05:59.889> a<00:05:59.919> 7.1<00:06:00.520> surround<00:06:00.669> sound

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
thinking you have a 7.1 surround sound

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.370 
thinking you have a 7.1 surround sound
system<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.889> you'll<00:06:03.039> click<00:06:03.130> finish<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.820> now

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
system so you'll click finish and now

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.279 
system so you'll click finish and now
windows<00:06:05.380> thinks<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.880> your<00:06:07.030> headset<00:06:07.479> is<00:06:07.690> 7.1

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
windows thinks that your headset is 7.1

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.350 
windows thinks that your headset is 7.1
surround<00:06:08.380> sound<00:06:08.620> when<00:06:09.250> it's<00:06:09.370> really<00:06:09.580> not<00:06:09.729> the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.000 
surround sound when it's really not the
software<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:11.169> USB<00:06:11.500> sound<00:06:11.710> card<00:06:11.800> will

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.909 
software and the USB sound card will
take<00:06:12.130> care<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.400> that<00:06:13.169> so<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.320> next<00:06:14.590> thing<00:06:14.830> you

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
take care of that so the next thing you

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.670 
take care of that so the next thing you
need<00:06:15.039> to<00:06:15.099> do<00:06:15.340> is<00:06:15.639> in<00:06:16.000> game<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:17.289> need<00:06:17.409> to<00:06:17.560> go
