00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 9 in today's video I can tell you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.020
 promise that it will definitely be 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 worthwhile for you to listen or 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 join in because it's got a brave 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 group of youtube and gathered together 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 and thinks for you the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 subscribers to a paysafecard tournament 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.029
 organize the organizers under me 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 Of course, these are the following 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.480
 These people are passionate 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.240
 people because they are copious with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 have occupied league of legends and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.529
 create a sting or let's place or 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
 montage videos or previews and such 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.540
 continue and so on 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.480
 that is easily into the Glems 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 see beautiful games and us 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 just think about a tournament wet 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 to organize where you of course 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 join in and where of course hot 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 gains on you and that amounts to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 the whole we can see here is 30 euro 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.920
 that is the first place to win the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 first set win 15 210 and the third 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 in the small final five euro in the form of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 paysafe com 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.619
 with these cards you can go to the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.150
 example of skins or heroes in lima 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.990
 buy surfaces that is absolutely no 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.119
 problem 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.020
 The tournament itself is as follows 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 built up 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.860
 on the one hand the fight is going on 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 respectively, the games start up 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.990
 The map twisted game is going on 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 two against two played very important 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 Here is that only on the hotline the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 fight or even allow it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 the middle jungle is not a problem 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.900
 the top lehndorff however in no case 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.130
 This is very important 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.930
 it is played in tournament mode 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 that means there are only two 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.280
 teams but it will be at the beginning anyway 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.049
 that's very important 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.259
 the number of participants will be either 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.700
 mind you on 16 or 32 teams 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.259
 we do not yet know how to limit ourselves 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.130
 many people at this tournament 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.840
 want to participate 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 so keep us first in the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.340
 smaller number open 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 more importantly it is also in the ko 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 Mode played that means if you have one 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.880
 game loses is to get the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.070
 also play the following 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.719
 It does not work like this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.670
 the nexus be destroyed but it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.350
 simply comes first four to kill 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 that means the team gets that first 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 four kills or made it in 2000 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.590
 The game has already won places 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.550
 that means the games will be about 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.990
 a length of 20 minutes have something 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.940
 reasonable time is quite easy 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.080
 to organize a tournament which I did 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.510
 everything should go too long 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.090
 the date of the tournament will be the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.410
 tenth eleventh was the time that she 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.690
 not quite sure have us but 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.570
 initially set at 17 o'clock there 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.100
 Of course, several then younger 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.290
 players easily participate 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.620
 to which must be said that 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.480
 This Saturday is good I will 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.160
 of course all the information in 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.840
 The description of riding and it will be 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.580
 still one or the other update video 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.530
 where I come for example frequently 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.410
 asked questions try in video form 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.940
 to clarify again 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.200
 or will of course one 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.330
 update takes place at the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.900
 the application deadline is the application 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.209
 is you can submit up to 7 11 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.560
 at the following address 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.270
 subject to challenge dot com 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 there she just writes me one 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.590
 mail with the following information 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.080
 At first, the subject should hardly be concerned 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.120
 called tournament and you write there 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.640
 quite simply the following things in and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.709
 Summon the summoner name of yours 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.730
 Colleagues and youtube names for us 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.110
 of course want to know if the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.980
 subscribers or not there of course 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.930
 this tournament is for the subscribers 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.430
 exactly team name actually needs 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.500
 we do not think if we have one 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.750
 pure but the organization will be 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.459
 impractical if you send us the mail 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 you have sent out as follows 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.060
 of course we check if all the data is in 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.420
 order and whether the players are complete 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.220
 simply exist in reality and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 Schierstein back with a mail 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.040
 all information that means who 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.320
 would need a friendship invitation 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.940
 Send what is the name of the chat room as 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.190
 the tournament runs in a small way 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.989
 or in detail has the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.549
 key data but already mentioned 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.019
 that means you can easily get one 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.209
 application to the address below 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.610
 send if you at this tournament 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.110
 want to participate, based again on 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.600
 the number of participants, we have 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.030
 thinks either man or 16 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.209
 16 apologies either 16 teams 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.310
 or 32 teams depending on how 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.919
 big the rush on this e mail 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.120
 Being an address is very important 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.130
 that, of course, that number is not 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.810
 directly to 16 or 32 respectively 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.480
 teams stands firm but we will still 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.060
 some teams take more action 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.350
 just the unlikely event 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.140
 that, for example, someone gets sick or 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.330
 but if not can or just a lot 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.770
 it will be too late, it will be easy 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.210
 can not attend and it would be 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.320
 Of course the next applicants 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.300
 move up 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.160
 The application itself is like 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.910
 said no problem you regulate the whole 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.770
 simply via the email address and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.390
 this is more or less the motto 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.490
 the absolute fairness and who 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.920
 Of course, the doctor comes first 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.120
 subscribers to the great benefits of the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.070
 of course, this video pretty much 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.910
 kuolt so much 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.230
 First of all , I'm afraid 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.760
 something to forget that already see 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.650
 very briefly on my computer 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.020
 but actually everything should be there 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.020
 stand exactly as I said the tournament 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.270
 will take place on 11 10 11 and was 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.280
 Closing date is almost the seventh 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.780
 eleventh because for us it is very important 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.180
 that we are running the tournament 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.560
 Organize that means should possible 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.990
 Little waiting times arise 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.580
 that's why I too it will be on 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.350
 In any case, short waiting times arise 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.210
 that 's why i will do the role of 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.800
 Kindergartens take over and me completely 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.210
 just with you in the chat room conspicuous 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800
 talk about everything or you 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.810
 You can ask about moorings 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.370
 while others do theirs 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.170
 Quite simply denying games 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.850
 The point, of course, is that we are not 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.960
 all games take place simultaneously 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.520
 that means it can be left on 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.140
 definitely caused the waits 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.210
 but will be minimal since we 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.100
 Of course, many comparatively many 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.320
 helper because we need people who 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.480
 Watch the games with that later 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.940
 colors that's very important to us that 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.000
 nobody cheats in uniform or from 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.510
 This is definitely not going to be fooled 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.510
 happen 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.100
 in itself, the restriction is what 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.000
 which concerns the application itself 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.130
 not available that means you can 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.650
 all accounts are taken, that is you 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.690
 can be level 1 or could be 30 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.210
 Of course a big advantage is if 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.570
 This is a higher level since that is 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.070
 clear 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.420
 that is, if you want to go back to selection 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.120
 has and for a match champions to 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.060
 selection because it is brought as I said 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.220
 so good that he actually the first 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.720
 generally facts about the necessary 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.560
 left and all necessary information 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.970
 tries 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.580
 I later in the description 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.470
 and of course it will 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.970
 one or the other update video come where 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.860
 I tell you for example if that 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.570
 tournament is already full or if 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.960
 really so blatant questions came up that 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.790
 say 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.430
 It is too much to write now 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.870
 that'll be easy in video form 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.400
 An update video will answer it 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.110
 give each case and where I have the 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.270
 tournament will show why this is 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.440
 of course empty now 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.000
 and when all participants are there 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.740
 We fulfill this meaning you can 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.540
 you are already familiar with yes against 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.820
 who plays if I win 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:09.950
 and so on could the other people 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:13.790
 start or what he is and where look 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.080
 It's fine here I think that's it 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.790
 i should forget that it would like 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.919
 I say in the description
