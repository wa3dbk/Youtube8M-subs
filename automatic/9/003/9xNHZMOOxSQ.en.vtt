 we describe here a very widespread species 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.939
 spontaneously in the original Italy 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.890

 coastal on the shores of the pre-alpine lakes 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.379
 it is the only spontaneous palm in 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.839
 europa the height the diameter are of 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.360
 about 12 meters while the specimens 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.859
 cultivated can become 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.859
 also 7 8 meters high 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 there is also a variety of ladakh tilo 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.250
 carp that reaches even 6 meters 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.630

 elongated and woody at the end of which 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.680
 the palmate laminae are divided into 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.020
 linear segments arranged in a fan and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.650
 they are gathered in a tuft at the top 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.650
 of the stem 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.290
 the palm is planted in spring by placing 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 the dwelling in all drained soils can 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.030
 be placed in full sun or even

 partially in the shade the important thing 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.290
 be sheltered from the winds to multiply them 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.540
 the basal buds supplied with are detached 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.760
 two or three leaves to be potted into 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.980
 containers that will be grown in 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.380
 positions repaired for about a year 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.130
 before being planted the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.130
 next spring 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.880
 in colder regions it will be good 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.880
 grow these sprouts in greenhouses
