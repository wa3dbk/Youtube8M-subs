he's<00:00:00.120> a<00:00:00.210> bigger<00:00:00.450> guard<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:01.500> his<00:00:02.490> strides<00:00:02.820> are

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
he's a bigger guard so his strides are

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.400 
he's a bigger guard so his strides are
longer<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.480> he's<00:00:03.870> getting<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.200> basket

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
longer so he's getting to the basket

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.680 
longer so he's getting to the basket
nice<00:00:04.770> finishing<00:00:05.190> well<00:00:05.339> tonight<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.420> shot<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
nice finishing well tonight you shot the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.509 
nice finishing well tonight you shot the
ball<00:00:06.839> really<00:00:07.080> well<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.950> think<00:00:08.189> help<00:00:08.370> them

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
ball really well which I think help them

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.650 
ball really well which I think help them
out<00:00:08.580> even<00:00:08.820> more<00:00:08.849> because<00:00:09.059> now<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
out even more because now we have to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.330 
out even more because now we have to
close<00:00:09.840> out<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.200> which<00:00:10.740> allow<00:00:10.950> them<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> take

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
close out on which allow them to take

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.480 
close out on which allow them to take
drives<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.330> basket<00:00:12.950> they<00:00:13.950> shoot<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> ball

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
drives to the basket they shoot the ball

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.010 
drives to the basket they shoot the ball
well<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.880> mean<00:00:15.210> that's<00:00:15.299> that's<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.630> hard<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
well I mean that's that's pretty hard to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.050 
well I mean that's that's pretty hard to
garden<00:00:16.520> when<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.940> transition

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
garden when they get out in transition

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.670 
garden when they get out in transition
wants<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> couple<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.230> stops<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.619> then

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
wants to get a couple of stops and then

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.109 
wants to get a couple of stops and then
knock<00:00:19.980> down<00:00:20.160> threes<00:00:20.490> those<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.850> those<00:00:21.060> are

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
knock down threes those are those are

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.460 
knock down threes those are those are
daggers<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.720> those<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:21.960> hard<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> come<00:00:22.289> back

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
daggers and those are hard to come back

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
daggers and those are hard to come back
from<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.960> easy<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.880> try<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
from I think it's it's easy to try and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
from I think it's it's easy to try and
come<00:00:27.330> back<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> hit<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> 318<00:00:28.260> hitter<00:00:28.320> 3<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
come back and hit a 318 hitter 3 and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
come back and hit a 318 hitter 3 and
what<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.000> realize<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
what we have to realize that we're a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.690 
what we have to realize that we're a
little<00:00:31.349> taller<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.099> inside<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.610> we

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
little taller on the inside so we

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.979 
little taller on the inside so we
probably<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> ball<00:00:33.390> inside<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> little

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
probably got the ball inside a little

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.470 
probably got the ball inside a little
bit<00:00:34.079> more<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:35.010> um<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.940> said<00:00:35.969> getting<00:00:36.420> out

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
bit more but um like I said getting out

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.729 
bit more but um like I said getting out
in<00:00:36.570> transition<00:00:36.690> being<00:00:37.290> able<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> knock<00:00:37.710> down

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
in transition being able to knock down

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
in transition being able to knock down
threes<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.460> almost<00:00:38.910> every<00:00:39.149> position<00:00:39.469> it's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
threes from almost every position it's

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
threes from almost every position it's
hard<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> guard<00:00:40.860> especially<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.579> college<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
hard to guard especially in college I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
hard to guard especially in college I
think<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.690> different<00:00:43.050> teams<00:00:43.260> iowa

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
think there are different teams iowa

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
think there are different teams iowa
state<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.930> team<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.440> any

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
state is not really a a team like any

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
state is not really a a team like any
other<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> country<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
other in the country but just because of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 
other in the country but just because of
the<00:00:48.210> matchup<00:00:48.629> problems<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.110> pose<00:00:49.610> Melvin

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the matchup problems they pose Melvin

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.520 
the matchup problems they pose Melvin
and

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.700 
and
George<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.460> like<00:00:52.610> those<00:00:53.090> guys<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.710> basically

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
George is like those guys are basically

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.979 
George is like those guys are basically
three<00:00:54.800> men<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.550> they<00:00:55.850> play<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.239> 4<00:00:56.420> into<00:00:56.600> 5<00:00:56.719> for

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
three men and they play the 4 into 5 for

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.720 
three men and they play the 4 into 5 for
this<00:00:57.079> team<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:57.500> they<00:00:57.649> they<00:00:58.190> play<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.699> know

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
this team so they they play you know

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.250 
this team so they they play you know
when<00:00:59.030> they<00:00:59.120> come<00:00:59.329> down<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.660> transition<00:01:00.140> they

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
when they come down in transition they

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.560 
when they come down in transition they
run<00:01:00.469> 5<00:01:00.710> out<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.309> gotta<00:01:01.489> teams<00:01:02.390> are

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
run 5 out and you gotta teams are

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.479 
run 5 out and you gotta teams are
trained<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.350> run<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.769> rim<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.009> stop<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
trained to run to the rim and stop the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.310 
trained to run to the rim and stop the
rim<00:01:04.699> but<00:01:04.729> they're<00:01:05.059> running<00:01:05.330> for<00:01:05.479> three<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.080> I

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
rim but they're running for three so I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.680 
rim but they're running for three so I
mean<00:01:07.070> they<00:01:07.190> have<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> 65<00:01:07.970> point<00:01:08.270> guard<00:01:08.509> who's<00:01:08.659> a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
mean they have a 65 point guard who's a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.660 
mean they have a 65 point guard who's a
great<00:01:08.960> passer<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.890> obviously<00:01:10.250> score

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
great passer and you can obviously score

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.030 
great passer and you can obviously score
so<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.060> mean<00:01:11.420> they're<00:01:12.259> they're<00:01:12.290> just<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.830> matchup

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
so I mean they're they're just a matchup

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.010 
so I mean they're they're just a matchup
nightmare<00:01:13.220> for<00:01:13.759> teams<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.180> uh<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:14.840> we

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
nightmare for teams and uh you know we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.840 
nightmare for teams and uh you know we
we<00:01:15.649> ought<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:15.950> very<00:01:16.159> ready<00:01:16.399> for<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.640> next

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
we ought to be very ready for the next

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.730 
we ought to be very ready for the next
time<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.270> think<00:01:17.899> that's<00:01:18.170> when<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.320> turned<00:01:18.530> into<00:01:18.710> a

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
time I think that's when I turned into a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.240 
time I think that's when I turned into a
fan<00:01:18.950> I'd<00:01:19.100> like<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.399> see<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:19.580> matchup

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
fan I'd like to see that matchup

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.340 
fan I'd like to see that matchup
Syracuse<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.549> think<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.090> mean<00:01:23.539> that<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:24.080> zone

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
Syracuse I think I mean that that zone

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.969 
Syracuse I think I mean that that zone
yeah<00:01:25.070> no<00:01:25.640> one<00:01:25.850> can<00:01:26.090> compare<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:27.770> far

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
yeah no one can compare to that as far

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.919 
yeah no one can compare to that as far
as<00:01:28.009> Kentucky<00:01:28.520> goes<00:01:28.670> uh<00:01:28.729> i<00:01:29.360> would<00:01:29.690> i<00:01:29.869> would

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
as Kentucky goes uh i would i would

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.370 
as Kentucky goes uh i would i would
think<00:01:30.850> iowa<00:01:31.850> state<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.270> more<00:01:32.539> they're

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380

a<00:01:55.909> run<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.240> am<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:58.149> seen<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.299> tape<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.689> he<00:01:59.810> was

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
a run I am I seen on tape that he was

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.050 
a run I am I seen on tape that he was
obviously<00:02:00.560> very<00:02:00.860> good<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.670> very<00:02:01.729> talented

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
obviously very good and very talented

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.690 
obviously very good and very talented
but<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.810> see<00:02:02.960> him<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.140> person<00:02:03.700> size

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
but when you see him in person size

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.249 
but when you see him in person size
strength<00:02:05.350> speed<00:02:07.420> he<00:02:08.420> affects<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> game<00:02:08.989> in<00:02:09.200> a

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
strength speed he affects the game in a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.850 
strength speed he affects the game in a
variety<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.739> ways<00:02:09.829> can<00:02:10.280> guard<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.640> multiple

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
variety of ways can guard a multiple

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060 
variety of ways can guard a multiple
multiple<00:02:12.860> positions<00:02:13.670> he's<00:02:14.660> he's<00:02:15.560> really<00:02:15.860> good

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
multiple positions he's he's really good

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.550 
multiple positions he's he's really good
and<00:02:16.220> coming<00:02:17.209> in<00:02:17.329> I<00:02:17.450> heard<00:02:17.870> he<00:02:17.989> was<00:02:18.140> good<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.500> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and coming in I heard he was good but I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.360 
and coming in I heard he was good but I
think<00:02:19.239> he's<00:02:20.239> far<00:02:20.450> surpassed<00:02:20.890> what<00:02:21.890> what

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
think he's far surpassed what what

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.099 
think he's far surpassed what what
people<00:02:22.609> might<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.790> thought<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.780> impact

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
people might have thought and the impact

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.720 
people might have thought and the impact
you<00:02:24.260> would<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.829> team<00:02:24.890> they<00:02:25.609> have<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you would have on this team they have a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.910 
you would have on this team they have a
pack<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.209> defense<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.410> hard<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.799> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
pack in defense so it's hard to get the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.199 
pack in defense so it's hard to get the
ball<00:02:28.100> inside<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:28.730> kind<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:28.940> like<00:02:29.060> in

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
ball inside it's kind of like in

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.120 
ball inside it's kind of like in
football<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:29.810> put<00:02:30.019> eight<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.709> nine<00:02:30.980> in

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
football when they put eight and nine in

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.910 
football when they put eight and nine in
the<00:02:31.220> box<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.880> hard<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> run<00:02:32.329> it<00:02:32.799> second<00:02:33.799> thing

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the box it's hard to run it second thing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.560 
the box it's hard to run it second thing
is<00:02:34.160> they<00:02:34.340> did<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.519> great<00:02:34.730> job<00:02:34.760> dublin<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.480> i
