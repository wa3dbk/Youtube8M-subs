experience<00:01:43.290> correct

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
experience correct

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.149

for<00:01:44.100> example<00:01:44.579> iker<00:01:45.060> casillas<00:01:45.570> has<00:01:45.930> played<00:01:46.159> 154

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
for example iker casillas has played 154

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
for example iker casillas has played 154
times<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.670> spain<00:01:47.939> whilst<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> most<00:01:48.689> caped

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

dutch<00:01:49.409> goalkeeper<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.340> michel<00:01:50.759> vom<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.560> 14

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
dutch goalkeeper is michel vom at 14

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.700 
dutch goalkeeper is michel vom at 14
capes<00:01:53.130> neither<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.360> scored<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> goal<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
capes neither have scored a goal so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.929 
capes neither have scored a goal so
technically<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.460> means<00:01:56.790> they're

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
technically that means they're

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.209 
technically that means they're
neck-and-neck<00:01:57.119> though<00:01:57.810> logically<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> suppose

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
neck-and-neck though logically I suppose

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.830 
neck-and-neck though logically I suppose
that<00:01:59.430> means<00:01:59.610> ROM<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.420> better

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that means ROM is better

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
that means ROM is better
