 my company very serious and they give me a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.979
 inventory for each coffee envelope and or 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.890
 I have to bring a phone number to 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.890
 the telephone company to call what 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.270
 they expect this inventory to look bad 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.149
 then it would be my turn to return to a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.270

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.409
 yes gentlemen distributors of the company 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.759
 doll body this is the way as 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.009
 Do not deliver the coffee if the person 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.039
 he does not give his phone number why 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.710
 because even if you have your name and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.110
 the number here back marked that person 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.000
 he will not call him if he feels he delivers 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.399
 the coffee is better than the person 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 deliver the phone number to you 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.739

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.140
 to that person we vote your business this 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.660
 coffee can serve for another person who 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.510
