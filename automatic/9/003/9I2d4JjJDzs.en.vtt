 haha ha 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 today's customization we will use the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.240
 paste 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.040
 I use this one is that the colors she 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.650
 extra strong is quite easy to be 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.430
 found that they are in the house of 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.050
 paper house and ink crafts 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.020
 building house 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.080
 the old spray this one is with the hair 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.830
 very bright you will also find in 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.119
 paint house 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.690
 the glitter shoe 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.220
 here I have eight dots of those 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.289
 You little ones can buy that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.890
 big but here they come in fashion and 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.660
 pays off because I use the tape if you 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.479
 to make a whole shoe will not 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.509
 I need to do only one part. 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:54.399
 the brush 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:59.229
 Yeah, I gotta be a cuddly one and I'm going 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.939
 also use a chain I started 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.610
 marking where I'm going to glue what 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.490
 I'll tell you what to do on the edge and here 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.220
 under the jump then the tape here 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.040
 to see how far I'll go and 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.530
 I put what you do marking 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.970
 just the way you want it 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.590
 Now I'd rather get a pot 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:31.590
 I'll put some glitter 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:32.489
 ah ah ah and a little glue got like 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.980
 to move 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:41.930
 I'll make a dough is more glue 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.930
 twitter're O 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.330
 and then I'm going to pass not only will I start 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 to make it is important that the shoe is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.530
 very clean and Jorge 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.690
 ah ah ah ah 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.240
 now I 've already passed my glue by 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.890
 All the shovel I'm going to play now and I 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.940
 I put a sheet underneath to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:32.230
 Play that fell Enjoy then I will 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:32.230
 play I'll take the excess 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.960
 Then I came with my finger thinking I play. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.750
 O 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.030
 now I'll let it dry I'll make the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.040
 here below and another shoe and 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.560
 I'll come back to chain and then 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.000
 then finalize with good now dried up 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.020
 and I'm going to take the tape very carefully 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.580
 I 'll always give you a safe here. 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:19.989
 to avoid the risk of pulling and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:23.160
 scola raised the portion of the ball bic 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 take it close here 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:53.740
 ah ah ah you can even stop here 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.780
 that Justin has already communicated but I'm going 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.990
 put more detail put this 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.990
 Correntinha is going to stay like this. 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:12.040
 which I have not yet started with the right to 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.440
 head never come on I'll use 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.360
 same glue I used to put 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.330
 Someone I just put here in this business. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.080
 of ketchup to make it easy to put here 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.080
 I'm just going to follow 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.190
 do not worry was having enough glue 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.980
 yes, because after that kan will stay 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:58.640
 transparent 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:06:01.160
 now just put continuous to now 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.960
 expecting ck bloch is the end result 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.390
 shoe even though it is not over 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.420
 still this month the final result 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:11.480
 the only thing missing now is the veneer 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.460
 I 'll pass two layers of ney varnish 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.160
 You ask me, do you need to? 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.870
 need to pass because varnish is because 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:24.250
 so now you pass us to the fact and he 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.990
 loose click is in your hand 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.750
 not much but only a little bit 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.030
 then the varnish will be on the cell phone to 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.990
 not drop out more liquid home 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.940
 Do you take rain from something? 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.800
 sealed and then it will be more difficult to 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.630
 get out your shoe 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.670
 That's when I did it so I cover all the 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.270
 shoe with toilet paper 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.400
 I left here รณ that part out and this 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.710
 There I'll pass a layer of 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.900
 and then I'll spend another 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.920
 layer is still sealed and shoe there 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.920
 you can already use
