00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
a lot of people been trying to figure

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.910 
a lot of people been trying to figure
out<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> make<00:00:02.939> earthing<00:00:03.480> shoes<00:00:03.780> that<00:00:04.740> is

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
out how to make earthing shoes that is

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.700 
out how to make earthing shoes that is
to<00:00:05.160> get<00:00:05.339> their<00:00:05.629> shoes<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.930> sandals<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.529> they

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
to get their shoes and sandals that they

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.560 
to get their shoes and sandals that they
can<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:07.950> grounding<00:00:08.429> while<00:00:08.639> they're<00:00:08.790> walking

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
can be grounding while they're walking

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.600 
can be grounding while they're walking
because<00:00:10.170> most<00:00:10.440> shoes<00:00:10.710> keep<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.130> separated

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
because most shoes keep you separated

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.030 
because most shoes keep you separated
from<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> energy<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> earth<00:00:13.040> here's

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
from the energy of the earth here's

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.090 
from the energy of the earth here's
something<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> slapped<00:00:14.969> together<00:00:16.100> this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
something that I slapped together this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.990 
something that I slapped together this
is<00:00:17.279> actually<00:00:17.699> stainless<00:00:18.210> steel<00:00:18.449> strapping

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
is actually stainless steel strapping

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.609 
is actually stainless steel strapping
material<00:00:21.000> that's<00:00:21.180> used<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.630> attaching

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
material that's used for attaching

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.150 
material that's used for attaching
things<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.310> light<00:00:23.640> post<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.920> get

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
things to light post and you can get

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.620 
things to light post and you can get
this<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> internet<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.090> heavy<00:00:27.269> duty

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
this on the internet it's heavy duty

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.210 
this on the internet it's heavy duty
stuff<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.619> wrapping<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> around

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
stuff but just by wrapping it around

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.380 
stuff but just by wrapping it around
here<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> heel<00:00:31.520> this<00:00:32.520> touches<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> ground

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
here the heel this touches the ground

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
here the heel this touches the ground
and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> heel<00:00:34.230> sits<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> middle<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and then the heel sits in the middle so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
and then the heel sits in the middle so
it's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.120> spring<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.750> but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's a little bit of a spring there but

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
it's a little bit of a spring there but
there's<00:00:37.860> other<00:00:38.070> ways<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.309> people<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:39.059> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
there's other ways that people can do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's other ways that people can do
groaning<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> shoe<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
groaning you can take a shoe and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.690 
groaning you can take a shoe and
grommets<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> good<00:00:43.110> thing<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.700> either

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
grommets are a good thing to use either

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.869 
grommets are a good thing to use either
brass<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.450> copper<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.550> hollow

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
brass or copper and there's hollow

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
brass or copper and there's hollow
grommets<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.620> hole<00:00:50.160> drilled<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
grommets that can be a hole drilled and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
grommets that can be a hole drilled and
then<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.090> drive<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> grommet<00:00:51.960> through

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
then you can drive the grommet through

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
then you can drive the grommet through
and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> tool<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.460> flare<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and then with a tool you can flare the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.220 
and then with a tool you can flare the
end<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.039> they<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:57.109> grommets<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
end of it they also have grommets that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.400 
end of it they also have grommets that
Arkin<00:00:58.590> set<00:00:59.030> screw<00:01:00.030> together<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> double

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
Arkin set screw together it's a double

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.939 
Arkin set screw together it's a double
headed<00:01:02.030> grommet<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.199> those<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.500> put<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
headed grommet and those can be put in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250 
headed grommet and those can be put in
and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.119> screwed<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.990> tight

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and then they can be screwed to as tight

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.399 
and then they can be screwed to as tight
as<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.409> there's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
as you want them to be and there's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
as you want them to be and there's
another<00:01:10.740> question<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.090> them

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
another question to is do you put them

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.469 
another question to is do you put them
under<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> pressure<00:01:12.960> points<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> toes

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
under the pressure points of the toes

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.080 
under the pressure points of the toes
some<00:01:15.479> people<00:01:16.040> like<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> earth<00:01:17.340> runner<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
some people like the earth runner put it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
some people like the earth runner put it
further<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.750> under<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.799> ball<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.430> foot

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
further back under the ball of the foot

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
further back under the ball of the foot
so<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> there's<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.290> pressure<00:01:22.619> on

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so that there's not so much pressure on

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.030 
so that there's not so much pressure on
it<00:01:23.390> one<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> drawbacks<00:01:24.869> though<00:01:25.470> having

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it one of the drawbacks though having

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
it one of the drawbacks though having
something<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.460> goes<00:01:26.759> solid<00:01:27.150> through

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
something that goes solid through

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
something that goes solid through
whether<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> grommet<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.130> whether<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
whether it be a grommet or whether it be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.679 
whether it be a grommet or whether it be
a<00:01:29.700> strap<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.430> is<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.759> there's<00:01:33.479> no

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
a strap like this is that there's no

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
a strap like this is that there's no
cushion<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.380> there's<00:01:34.590> no<00:01:34.770> give<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
cushion there there's no give it's a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
cushion there there's no give it's a
solid<00:01:36.630> solid<00:01:37.729> metal<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:39.210> through<00:01:39.710> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
solid solid metal going through and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.270 
solid solid metal going through and
there's<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.670> way<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.710> around<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there's one way to to get around that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
there's one way to to get around that
and<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.570> use<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.750> double

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and that is actually to use a double

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
and that is actually to use a double
tack<00:01:46.439> method<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.430> put<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
tack method and that's to put like a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230 
tack method and that's to put like a
tack<00:01:48.689> or<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> nail<00:01:49.200> down<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.090> put

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
tack or a nail down through like to put

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
tack or a nail down through like to put
a<00:01:51.270> hole<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> hole<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
a hole so you can know where the hole is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.120 
a hole so you can know where the hole is
and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.310> drive<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> tack<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.270> nail<00:01:54.799> down<00:01:55.799> from

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and then drive a tack or nail down from

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
and then drive a tack or nail down from
the<00:01:56.219> top<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.090> another<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the top and then another one up from the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.370 
the top and then another one up from the
bottom<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> points<00:01:59.549> are<00:02:00.170> right<00:02:01.170> next

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
bottom so that the points are right next

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980 
bottom so that the points are right next
to<00:02:01.590> each<00:02:01.770> other<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> allows<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to each other and what it allows then is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.859 
to each other and what it allows then is
as<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.350> walk<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.520> points<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.540> tax

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
as you walk the the points of the tax

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.850 
as you walk the the points of the tax
will<00:02:07.770> slide<00:02:08.160> past<00:02:08.700> each<00:02:08.940> other<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:10.679> way

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
will slide past each other and that way

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.770 
will slide past each other and that way
you<00:02:10.920> still<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> cushion

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you still have the cushion

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.290 
you still have the cushion
the<00:02:13.560> thing<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.950> remember<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.580> earthing

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the thing to remember with earthing

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
the thing to remember with earthing
shoes<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.110> you're<00:02:16.410> never<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> be

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
shoes is that you're never going to be

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
shoes is that you're never going to be
in<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> hundred<00:02:17.490> percent<00:02:17.760> contact<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
in a hundred percent contact with the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
in a hundred percent contact with the
earth<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:20.070> order<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.340> do<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.850> you'd<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.300> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
earth in order to do that you'd have to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.060 
earth in order to do that you'd have to
have<00:02:21.710> spikes

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
have spikes

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.400 
have spikes
you<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.640> maybe<00:02:23.850> three<00:02:24.390> inch<00:02:24.540> spikes<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.230> get

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
you know maybe three inch spikes to get

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.530 
you know maybe three inch spikes to get
down<00:02:25.620> past<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> grass<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.850> pass<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.300> dry

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
down past the grass and pass the dry

down past the grass and pass the dry
soil<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.110> top<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
soil on top what you want to do is to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.250 
soil on top what you want to do is to
get<00:02:30.660> yourself<00:02:30.810> closer<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> earth<00:02:33.260> so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
get yourself closer to the earth so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
get yourself closer to the earth so
immediate<00:02:34.770> contact<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:37.620> virtually<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.520> mean

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
immediate contact is virtually I mean

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.930 
immediate contact is virtually I mean
direct<00:02:39.380> full<00:02:40.380> contact<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.430> virtually

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
direct full contact is is virtually

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.580 
direct full contact is is virtually
impossible<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.600> mean<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.810> person<00:02:43.200> could<00:02:43.380> get

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
impossible I mean a person could get

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.410 
impossible I mean a person could get
themselves<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:44.100> walking<00:02:44.490> stick<00:02:44.820> with<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> metal

point on it you know on a wire that goes

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.840 
point on it you know on a wire that goes
up<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> metal<00:02:49.560> handle<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.160> mean<00:02:50.730> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
up to the to a metal handle I mean you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.940 
up to the to a metal handle I mean you
could<00:02:51.030> ground<00:02:51.270> yourself<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.930> way<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.830> what

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
could ground yourself that way but what

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.770 
could ground yourself that way but what
you<00:02:53.100> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:53.940> yourself<00:02:54.090> closer

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you want to do is to get yourself closer

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.360 
you want to do is to get yourself closer
to<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> earth<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.450> want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> remove<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to the earth and you want to remove this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.030 
to the earth and you want to remove this
distance<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.209> insulation<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.110> that's<00:03:01.740> where

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
distance of insulation and that's where

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.620 
distance of insulation and that's where
the<00:03:02.160> double<00:03:02.459> tack<00:03:02.700> method<00:03:03.150> works<00:03:03.330> good

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the double tack method works good

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.190 
the double tack method works good
another<00:03:03.990> thing<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.940> take

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
another thing that you can do is to take

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.680 
another thing that you can do is to take
either<00:03:07.200> copper<00:03:07.740> wire<00:03:07.980> or<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.209> also<00:03:09.390> get

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
either copper wire or you can also get

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.960 
either copper wire or you can also get
stainless<00:03:10.230> steel<00:03:10.560> wire<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.340> use<00:03:11.580> in

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
stainless steel wire that they use in

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.080 
stainless steel wire that they use in
electronics<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.170> grounding<00:03:13.800> lights<00:03:14.700> and

it's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.610> braided<00:03:18.739> stainless<00:03:19.739> steel<00:03:20.220> wire<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
it's a braided stainless steel wire and

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.120 
it's a braided stainless steel wire and
you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.150> actually<00:03:21.390> put<00:03:22.260> holes<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.709> your<00:03:22.860> shoe

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
you can actually put holes in your shoe

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.220 
you can actually put holes in your shoe
and<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.430> stitch<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.120> down<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.690> what

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and just stitch up and down and what

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.190 
and just stitch up and down and what
that<00:03:25.470> does<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.340> have<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.550> row<00:03:26.850> of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that does then is you have a row of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.540 
that does then is you have a row of
stitching<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.769> top<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.340> row<00:03:29.519> of

stitching on the top and a row of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.759 
stitching on the top and a row of
stitching<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.420> bottom<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
stitching on the bottom and with the

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.680 
stitching on the bottom and with the
stainless<00:03:32.040> steel<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.850> will<00:03:33.000> survive<00:03:33.390> even

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
stainless steel it will survive even

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.890 
stainless steel it will survive even
better<00:03:34.459> than<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.880> will<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> copper<00:03:36.600> because

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
better than then will a copper because

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.100 
better than then will a copper because
the<00:03:37.019> copper<00:03:37.350> tends<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> bit<00:03:38.250> softer<00:03:38.820> but

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
the copper tends to be a bit softer but

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.930 
the copper tends to be a bit softer but
because<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.220> have<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:41.610> closer

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
because you you just have to get closer

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.630 
because you you just have to get closer
to<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.360> earth<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> shoe<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> has

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
to the earth if you have a shoe that has

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640 
to the earth if you have a shoe that has
cleats<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.660> don't<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.290> put<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
cleats on it you don't have to put the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.380 
cleats on it you don't have to put the
stitching<00:03:47.100> coming<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.790> top<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.299> the

stitching coming out the top of the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.910 
stitching coming out the top of the
cleat<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.900> actually<00:03:49.230> put<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.769> the

cleat you can actually put it on the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.460 
cleat you can actually put it on the
recessed<00:03:50.430> part<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> cleat<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.320> way

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
recessed part of the cleat so that way

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990 
recessed part of the cleat so that way
it's<00:03:52.620> not<00:03:52.739> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.160> rubbed<00:03:53.400> off<00:03:53.610> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's not going to get rubbed off and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.900 
it's not going to get rubbed off and
that<00:03:54.150> puts<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.470> electricity<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.459> energy

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that puts the electricity the energy

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.870 
that puts the electricity the energy
that's<00:03:57.630> close<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.440> earth<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.370> moves<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> up

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
that's close to the earth it moves it up

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.130 
that's close to the earth it moves it up
further<00:04:00.209> toward<00:04:00.600> your<00:04:00.660> foot<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> there<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.049> is

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
further toward your foot so there it is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.070 
further toward your foot so there it is
that's<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.769> simple<00:04:05.130> way<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.310> doing<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.820> and

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
that's just a simple way of doing it and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160 
that's just a simple way of doing it and
a<00:04:07.310> lot<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.340> different<00:04:08.730> ideas<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.450> thank<00:04:09.959> you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
a lot of different ideas and thank you

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.709 
a lot of different ideas and thank you
for<00:04:10.560> watching
