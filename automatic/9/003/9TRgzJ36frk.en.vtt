these<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.770> mullet<00:00:50.219> they're<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.030> small

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

compared<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> other<00:00:52.680> fish<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.160> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
compared with the other fish but if I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
compared with the other fish but if I
lock<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.699> tightly<00:00:54.000> together<00:00:54.329> we'll<00:00:54.690> have

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
lock them tightly together we'll have

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
lock them tightly together we'll have
the<00:00:54.930> same<00:00:55.140> sort<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> density<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> fish<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the same sort of density of fish and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
the same sort of density of fish and
hopefully<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.539> cook<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.530> same

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
hopefully they will cook at the same

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
hopefully they will cook at the same
rate<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> pushed<00:00:59.520> those<00:00:59.640> quite<00:00:59.940> closely

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
rate so it pushed those quite closely

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.349 
rate so it pushed those quite closely
together<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:01.230> top<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> each<00:01:01.859> other

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
together on top of each other

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.730 
together on top of each other
okay<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.229> load<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.129> salt<00:01:06.409> goes<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
okay now a load more salt goes over the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.679 
okay now a load more salt goes over the
top<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> incidentally<00:01:11.010> just

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
top of all of them and incidentally just

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.230 
top of all of them and incidentally just
before<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> cover<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:14.400> taken<00:01:14.820> off<00:01:15.000> all

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
before I cover them I have taken off all

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.690 
before I cover them I have taken off all
their<00:01:15.450> fins<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.439> around<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> scaled

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
their fins all the way around and scaled

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
their fins all the way around and scaled
the<00:01:17.909> fish<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.540> well<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> fish<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.320> scaled

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the fish as well so the fish are scaled

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
the fish as well so the fish are scaled
and<00:01:20.009> their<00:01:20.430> fins<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.790> been<00:01:20.939> taken<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.330> but

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and their fins have been taken off but

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
and their fins have been taken off but
it<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> important<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.920> leave<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> heads<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it is important to leave the heads on to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.580 
it is important to leave the heads on to
keep<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> fish<00:01:24.630> whole<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.500> piece

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.450 

you<00:01:34.159> know<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:35.619> douse<00:01:36.619> tap<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.100> little

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
you know we just douse tap the little

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:47.349 
you know we just douse tap the little
bit<00:01:37.579> of<00:01:37.700> water<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:45.399> then<00:01:46.399> drizzle<00:01:46.939> around<00:01:47.119> me

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
bit of water so then drizzle around me

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.020 
bit of water so then drizzle around me
will<00:01:47.600> wetness<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.229> oven<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:48.829> set<00:01:49.100> at<00:01:49.250> 200

will wetness in the oven it's set at 200

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.809 
will wetness in the oven it's set at 200
on<00:01:50.179> electric<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.920> we<00:01:52.039> put<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.340> into<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
on electric and we put that into the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.919 
on electric and we put that into the
oven<00:01:53.229> until<00:01:54.229> such<00:01:54.439> time<00:01:54.770> as<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.969> salt<00:01:56.299> becomes

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
oven until such time as the salt becomes

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.880 
oven until such time as the salt becomes
crisp<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.590> top<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.100> slightly<00:01:59.000> burned<00:01:59.890> as

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
crisp on the top and slightly burned as

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.139 
crisp on the top and slightly burned as
it's<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.280> moment

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.920 

so<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.509> have<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.019> confess<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:11.420> never<00:02:11.660> cooked
