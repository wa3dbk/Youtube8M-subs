00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.320
 put the Swiss scam 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 these here are these good French girls 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.690
 and they are short too. 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 So it's the way I like it then. 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.050
 I put today for the graduation of the bell 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 I 'm ready, I put it on. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.170
 everything so delicate as a flower or 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 who expects a string without a pearl and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.800
 I did so in the curls Hair 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 session two neighboring nations 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 so let's learn how to put this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 at risk x to show you the way 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 How I put on sportsmen is the section 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 from here if I bought my trip 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.829
 orlando sells no album joÃ£o martins um 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 super cheap 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.739
 This is Francesinha and the best of everything. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.379
 they are coxinhas as I like to come 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.960
 a tube of glue a pinch of sandpaper and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 of various sizes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.170
 so it is for everyone the skewer size 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.750
 Then remembering that I 'm not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.760
 manicure I 'm just showing you the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.950
 The way I do it 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 I do not know if it 's right or wrong but it's the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
 What I do I 'm sharing with 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 You because you give enem 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 first gives a quickie in ligadinha 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 to remove any residue to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.710
 stay very well right 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.220
 done that I'll choose size 21 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 and tanks choose very well for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 that is not lacking and a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.110
 part of your natural nail then to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 do not get too big covering the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 your skin then this step of a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.119
 bit of time because you have to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.299
 choose well and separate 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.549
 all the nails you're separating for na 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.090
 time does not matter if you 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.520
 I used to confuse this judge as I did. 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.130
 I bought on my trip to Orlando and I 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.350
 I'll leave the video at the end of this video. 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 I'm going to leave a photo that takes you 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.580
 directly to the marketing video 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.920
 give the express that you know a 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.250
 A little better if you have not yet 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.700
 had the opportunity to go there then 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 now with actions all separated so the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.650
 next step will be good paste for 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.560
 paste actions 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.740
 I do not use a lot of glue I put 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.790
 only one drop on the nail and one 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.770
 a little bit too on my natural nail 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.750
 so a drop in the nail a drop in the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.180
 my natural nail I position and tighten 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.670
 A little bit to fix it right there I go 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.750
 doing all the nails this point 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.030
 then in the end I shot them all or stay 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.310
 so I'll do the same with 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.959
 all the others a little glue in the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.700
 nail a little glue on my nail 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.910
 I did not even put it in my 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 natural nails girls I do not put a lot 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.380
 glue there I shot the excess because if you 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.690
 put a lot of glue will stay in the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.890
 sides and it's all stuck inside 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.780
 so I do not particularly like and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.959
 works great because that nail is 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.830
 stay always stay in me more or less 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.310
 about seven days, a little more if I 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.280
 do not look very bad so I go 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.280
 thus placing in all regions 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.570
 cleaning the sides in this with my 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:40.420
 the other hand and she gets 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.360
 supernatural looks like 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.769
 one is well cared for now in the end I 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.910
 I take these plants away like this. 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.500
 She'll have nail care there. 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.900
 little ice to give that little bit 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.570
 I took but in the end I spend 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.140
 sandpaper to remove it 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.090
 they look natural they look super beautiful 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.549
 they last a long time 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.130
 and look, I live quite a hand and I do 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.730
 things at home and yet have a 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.330
 very good durability I will put it in the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.650
 another hand in the same way without mysteries 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.880
 in no secret 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.440
 now to remove the nail 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.720
 after 17 days most so in the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.150
 Seventh day or so, she's already gone. 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.420
 until half a crack then if you catch 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.670
 on the side as well and pull it out it does not 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.890
 is to pull the inha glued to damage your 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.090
 because it really was a 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.560
 little bit of cola 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.300
 when it gets like this at the end 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.760
 at the time that I want to take even the 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.130
 majority are already loose and for those 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.070
 that are still stuck I pick up a 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.380
 potting place acetone and bad dives 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.140
 in the shack it will soften you will 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.030
 then removing if you have any 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.000
 part in reais for you passes a 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.310
 napoli ready list 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.890
 now there are some specific things 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.840
 but I do not know if it sells here either. 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.940
 I saw there in the United States that you 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.590
 dip the nail item 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.360
 the chicks inside you go 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.070
 more easily 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.630
 I like teaching a method that all 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.910
 the world has at home that is accessible 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.000
 for everyone then dip your fingernail 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.410
 born and she removes what she has 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.190
 that having a little patience will 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.260
 usually leaving if you can 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.160
 ask to spoil nail I do not put 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.590
 always put and the pull shot puts another 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.750
 because only on special occasions when I 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.850
 I'm going out to a party and being like that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.720
 do not screw win now like I said 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:44.120
 you squeeze those rough and 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.450
 It stayed like this I hope you had 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.400
 click liked liked me to the 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.400
 next videos and bye bye
