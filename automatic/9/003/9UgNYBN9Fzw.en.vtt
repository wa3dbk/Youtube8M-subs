00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.070
 we will now see some exercises for the beginning of the movement's gem princess 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
 legs alternating 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.389
 observe that in these actions the movement of the legs is the same 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 only more than one woman is paulo 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.129
 this type of leg is much used by the cent marker 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 see again 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.190
 now let's see the alternating stride 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.840
 in displacements that are extremely 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740
 the technical reactions of marking 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.480
 source of marking 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 locks 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.270
 the father watched 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.090
 in the second of the alternating with displacement the movements are similar to the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.090
 static actions 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.370
 directing the body 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 with application of more force in the work of tite 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.720
 in displacement 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 see the video 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.070
 on the change of direction drive 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.960
 notice that the player always looks for a hip 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 the highest possible 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.539
 normally for the displacement of 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.820
 short distance 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.869
 the technique with diseased leg is used 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 I see again as a Russian athlete the movement of you wept for the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 displacement
