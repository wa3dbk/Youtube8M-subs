the<00:02:53.140> weekend<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.620> did<00:02:53.680> an<00:02:53.830> unofficial<00:02:54.569> test

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
the weekend I did an unofficial test

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.199 
the weekend I did an unofficial test
brew<00:02:56.019> using<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.310> first<00:02:57.519> two<00:02:57.760> burners

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
brew using just the first two burners

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.120 
brew using just the first two burners
just<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.049> see<00:02:59.200> how<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.349> plumbing<00:02:59.620> worked<00:02:59.950> out

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
just to see how the plumbing worked out

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.979 
just to see how the plumbing worked out
and<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.489> had<00:03:00.670> no<00:03:00.880> leaks<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.390> no<00:03:01.480> issues<00:03:01.810> that

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
and I had no leaks and no issues that

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.100 
and I had no leaks and no issues that
and<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.319> used<00:03:02.590> these<00:03:03.209> corrugated<00:03:04.209> steel<00:03:04.420> tubes

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
and I used these corrugated steel tubes

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.809 
and I used these corrugated steel tubes
which<00:03:05.349> made<00:03:05.560> me<00:03:05.680> feel<00:03:05.890> much<00:03:06.130> safer<00:03:06.370> about<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
which made me feel much safer about the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.570 
which made me feel much safer about the
whole<00:03:06.940> process<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.500> hopefully<00:03:09.040> next<00:03:09.160> time<00:03:09.310> you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
whole process so hopefully next time you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.930 
whole process so hopefully next time you
see<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.989> stand<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.739> stand<00:03:12.010> it'll<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.489> in

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
see this the stand the stand it'll be in

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.729 
see this the stand the stand it'll be in
action<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:14.130> three<00:03:15.130> vessel<00:03:15.610> brewing<00:03:16.569> all<00:03:17.380> at

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
action with three vessel brewing all at

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.509 
action with three vessel brewing all at
the<00:03:17.859> same<00:03:18.010> time<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:19.989> that

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the same time so you can see that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.009 
the same time so you can see that
ordering<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.730> valve<00:03:21.910> after<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.570> fact<00:03:22.840> now

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
ordering the valve after the fact now

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.530 
ordering the valve after the fact now
that<00:03:23.049> one's<00:03:23.410> got<00:03:23.590> like<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.730> knob<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.390> not

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that one's got like a that knob it's not

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.860 
that one's got like a that knob it's not
the<00:03:25.660> same<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:27.190> two<00:03:27.430> knobs<00:03:27.609> but<00:03:28.390> that's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the same as these two knobs but that's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.380 
the same as these two knobs but that's
okay<00:03:29.170> I'll<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.310> get<00:03:30.430> over<00:03:30.700> them<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.090> should

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
okay I'll have to get over them I should

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.120 
okay I'll have to get over them I should
have<00:03:31.480> ordered<00:03:31.630> three<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.140> first<00:03:32.350> time<00:03:32.620> but

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
have ordered three the first time but

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
have ordered three the first time but
the<00:03:33.340> place<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.730> got<00:03:33.940> these<00:03:34.060> from<00:03:34.299> no

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the place that I got these from no

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.920 
the place that I got these from no
longer<00:03:35.500> sells<00:03:35.709> those<00:03:35.920> knurled<00:03:36.569> knobs<00:03:37.569> it's

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
longer sells those knurled knobs it's

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.910 
longer sells those knurled knobs it's
just<00:03:38.140> these<00:03:38.340> flat<00:03:39.340> oblong<00:03:40.329> shaped<00:03:41.049> knobs<00:03:41.650> but

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
just these flat oblong shaped knobs but

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.410 
just these flat oblong shaped knobs but
that's<00:03:42.069> not<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.250> big<00:03:42.430> deal<00:03:42.459> as<00:03:42.940> long<00:03:43.030> as<00:03:43.299> it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
that's not a big deal as long as it

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.890 
that's not a big deal as long as it
works<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.910> that's<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.239> for<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.450> brew<00:03:46.600> stand

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
works so so that's it for the brew stand

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.550 
works so so that's it for the brew stand
so<00:03:47.109> far<00:03:48.630> like<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.720> said<00:03:49.900> hopefully<00:03:50.049> next<00:03:50.410> time

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
so far like I said hopefully next time

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.420 
so far like I said hopefully next time
we'll<00:03:50.920> fire<00:03:51.220> up<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.700> actual<00:03:52.630> brew<00:03:52.810> session

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
we'll fire up a actual brew session

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.430 
we'll fire up a actual brew session
Cheers
