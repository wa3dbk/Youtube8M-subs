00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.630
 Glory and get slalom 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.660
 16 players this 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.199
 that on the playground 16 game day is between 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:12.849
 Hannover 96 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:13.979
 and whom 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.820
 Otfried Stuttgart 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.820
 and the topgame 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.269
 now comes to mean 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.000
 at the match between Hannover 96 and VfB Stuttgart 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 gave s 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.089
 so far always more homesick 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.550
 and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 VfB Stuttgart have not even won away this season 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 and that's why 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 I think that Hannover 2 2 1 percent 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 the next match between Bayern Munich and 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.290
 FC St Pauli 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.830
 since the Paulian Orbison too 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.890
 this transaction 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.110
 have helped the leg but now you play again in a league 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.790
 against each other 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.220
 and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.550
 Pauli brought 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.230
 only once in Munich born 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.880
 and the Bavarians are currently 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570
 the home strongest team in the league and 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 therefore 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 I think that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 wins three to one Â» 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.969
 Deese encounter is between Hamburger SV and Bayer Leverkusen 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.370
 the HSV 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.810
 and private customers 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.990
 a thing at the moment together 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 the HSV remains 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.200
 the same home record 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 we are songs like Leverkusen away 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250
 I guess this game is two to two hands 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.740
 the next match is between TSG Hoffenheim and the first FC 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.160
 Nuremberg and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.410
 In the last song there was that first clash between the two 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.469
 in a league 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.339
 That's why I think now 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.759
 something special happens but there 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.759
 whether one wins the game 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.859
 the next game 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.719
 a first networks can and 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.169
 concord 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.909
 Fords and the Frankfurters 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.779
 currently have a good run 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.539
 the man was the Bayern Game 8 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:39.929
 and 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.319
 That's why Frankfurt continues to win 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 this time against Cologne with no 22 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.139
 the next game Barthel say aloud 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:01.109
 in the 2005 season 2005 the last Erstligaspielen Mandac Kaiserslautern 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.329
 the yellow ones 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.399
 Advantage Wolfsburg 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.319
 in this game at that time 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.769
 was that so 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.769
 Kaiserslautern and Wolfsburg could still descend 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.579
 Wolfsburg 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.799
 met and thereby Lautern descended 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.389
 This time was the result 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.649
 look a little different namely Kaiserslautern wins the game mild 2 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.649
 to 1 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:34.599
 the next match is the top match of this game day namely between 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.329
 Borussia Dortmund 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.039
 Werder Bremen 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.189
 the Bremer 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.189
 and at Dortmund everything is going great at the moment 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:47.779
 incredible 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.779
 in front of some, when I became an autumn master 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.219
 that would have fallen on a day rather unexpected 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.059
 has Dortmund 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.949
 back then 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:59.909
 at the game 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.939
 2002, the title sober 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:08.729
 2006 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.259
 Boll Lehmann won there last 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.290
 but they will not win there this time, but Bob Graham Smith then 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.289
 one already for the 90th 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.730
 The next encounter is the candles lining between 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.730
 Free throw and 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.029
 I think 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.029
 either 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.749
 only the last match of this game day 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.259
 between the 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.990
 FSV Mainz 05 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.229
 the Schalke 04 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.099
 Schalke may have returned and Mainz has one 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.969
 suffered a small setback 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.199
 but 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.909
 this time we will be swapping the roles 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.240
 the Schalke win 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 with a 2 2 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.020
 those were the tips to 16 games 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.380
 if I'm late in the evening 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.120
 the last of the first round 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.419
 and we live the name of Master St our village lives 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.939
 Congratulations 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.379
 the topics 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.870
 and 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.710
 See you then 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.740
 for the next matchday so again the sheet
