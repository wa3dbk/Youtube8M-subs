00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
normal direction and to create the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.670 
normal direction and to create the
mirror<00:01:02.329> defect<00:01:02.750> I'm<00:01:02.990> going<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.230> ink<00:01:03.410> him<00:01:03.530> up

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
again and stamp him on to the pair and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.130 
again and stamp him on to the pair and
then<00:01:07.130> when<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.580> place<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.300> over<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.630> can<00:01:08.930> see

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
then when I place that over I can see

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.380 
then when I place that over I can see
right<00:01:09.350> through<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.180> position<00:01:11.180> him

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
right through that and position him

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.600 
right through that and position him
right<00:01:11.600> there<00:01:11.810> opposite<00:01:12.320> or<00:01:12.530> facing<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.460> other

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
right there opposite or facing the other

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.399 
right there opposite or facing the other
bird<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.180> there<00:01:14.300> I've<00:01:14.420> got<00:01:14.450> my<00:01:14.750> mirror<00:01:15.020> image

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
bird and there I've got my mirror image

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.380 
bird and there I've got my mirror image
he's<00:01:16.010> just<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.280> little<00:01:16.580> bit<00:01:16.670> fainter<00:01:17.090> than<00:01:17.120> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
he's just a little bit fainter than the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.730 
he's just a little bit fainter than the
original<00:01:17.900> because<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.500> a

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
original because it is a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
original because it is a
second-generation<00:01:19.390> impression<00:01:20.390> basically

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
second-generation impression basically

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.120 
second-generation impression basically
you're<00:01:20.960> transferring<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.530> ink<00:01:21.740> from<00:01:21.890> that

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
you're transferring the ink from that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.550 
you're transferring the ink from that
solid<00:01:22.580> stamp<00:01:22.909> now<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.540> could<00:01:23.720> use<00:01:23.840> any<00:01:24.080> stamp

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
solid stamp now you could use any stamp

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.490 
solid stamp now you could use any stamp
you<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.190> for<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.640> if<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:27.050> an<00:01:27.200> image<00:01:27.470> that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
you like for this if it's an image that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.469 
you like for this if it's an image that
has<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.740> lot<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:27.950> detail<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.790> know<00:01:28.909> just<00:01:29.150> flip

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
has a lot of detail you know just flip

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.899 
has a lot of detail you know just flip
it<00:01:29.600> over<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.960> use<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.620> large<00:01:30.890> expanse<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
it over and use the large expanse of the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.789 
it over and use the large expanse of the
back<00:01:32.120> side<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.780> image<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:33.440> like<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.740> said

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
back side of that image but like I said

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.800 
back side of that image but like I said
if<00:01:34.159> it's<00:01:34.340> rubber<00:01:34.670> or<00:01:35.030> wood<00:01:35.240> mounted<00:01:35.600> you're

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
if it's rubber or wood mounted you're

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
little heart on the inside of my base

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.949 
little heart on the inside of my base
card<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.610> then<00:03:35.209> I'll<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.480> go<00:03:35.660> ahead<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
card and then I'll just go ahead and

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.270 
card and then I'll just go ahead and
fold<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.680> increase<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.430> fold<00:03:37.670> line<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:39.280> I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
fold that increase the fold line and I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.970 
fold that increase the fold line and I
am<00:03:40.489> actually<00:03:40.760> going<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.450> trace<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.470> outline

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
am actually going to trace the outline

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.790 
am actually going to trace the outline
of<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.670> top<00:03:44.180> panel<00:03:44.570> there<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.930> kind<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.410> put<00:03:45.709> it

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
of that top panel there I kind of put it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.199 
of that top panel there I kind of put it
on<00:03:45.920> top<00:03:46.100> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.340> card<00:03:46.550> base<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.850> realized<00:03:47.120> it

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
on top of the card base and realized it

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.540 
on top of the card base and realized it
needs<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.510> little<00:03:47.630> bit<00:03:47.900> more<00:03:48.080> oomph<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:49.310> lot

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
needs a little bit more oomph and a lot

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.250 
needs a little bit more oomph and a lot
of<00:03:49.670> times<00:03:49.880> when<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.330> need<00:03:50.510> some<00:03:50.660> oomph<00:03:50.900> this

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
of times when I need some oomph this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.680 
of times when I need some oomph this
little<00:03:51.500> detailing<00:03:51.950> trick<00:03:52.370> helps<00:03:53.180> me<00:03:53.360> out<00:03:53.390> and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
little detailing trick helps me out and

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
little detailing trick helps me out and
brings<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.019> eye<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.440> towards<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.860> focal

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
brings the eye in towards the focal

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.220 
brings the eye in towards the focal
images<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.940> then<00:03:56.330> I'm<00:03:56.450> going<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.690> 3d<00:03:57.019> mount

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
images and then I'm going to 3d mount

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.130 
images and then I'm going to 3d mount
this<00:03:57.380> with<00:03:57.620> some<00:03:57.830> foam<00:03:58.100> tape<00:03:58.130> onto<00:03:58.840> my<00:03:59.840> card

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
this with some foam tape onto my card

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.820 
this with some foam tape onto my card
base<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:01.000> once<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.120> have<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.360> in<00:04:02.810> place<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.470> can

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
base and once I have that in place I can

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.210 
base and once I have that in place I can
finally<00:04:04.250> embellish<00:04:05.209> this<00:04:05.480> guard<00:04:05.930> with<00:04:06.800> some

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
finally embellish this guard with some

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.039 
finally embellish this guard with some
sprinkles<00:04:07.850> these<00:04:08.000> are<00:04:08.120> Doodlebug<00:04:08.510> sprinkles

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890
