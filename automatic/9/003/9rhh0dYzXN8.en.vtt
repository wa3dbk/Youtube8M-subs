00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
X represent the larger number and why is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.810 
X represent the larger number and why is
the<00:00:30.090> smaller<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.980> well<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> instruction<00:00:32.669> at

the smaller one well the instruction at
the<00:00:32.940> end<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.020> everybody<00:00:34.320> will

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the end is really just so everybody will

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.290 
the end is really just so everybody will
get<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> same<00:00:35.100> answers<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.820> let's<00:00:36.030> start

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
get the same answers but let's start

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
get the same answers but let's start
with<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.510> top<00:00:36.899> blue<00:00:37.230> equation<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.399> sum<00:00:38.670> of

with that top blue equation the sum of
two<00:00:39.030> numbers<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.420> 25<00:00:40.250> if<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.430> call<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
two numbers is 25 if we call one of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.790 
two numbers is 25 if we call one of
those<00:00:42.120> numbers<00:00:42.540> X<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:43.950> number<00:00:44.340> y

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
those numbers X and the other number y

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
those numbers X and the other number y
that<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.129> written<00:00:47.309> easily<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.090> X<00:00:48.690> plus<00:00:48.930> y

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that can be written easily as X plus y

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.689 
that can be written easily as X plus y
equals<00:00:49.170> 25<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> second<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.520> sentence<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
equals 25 the second the sentence is a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
equals 25 the second the sentence is a
little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.149> harder<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.140> difference<00:00:55.680> between

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
little bit harder the difference between

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.209 
little bit harder the difference between
those<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.550> numbers<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> 15<00:00:57.890> well<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> problem

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
those two numbers is 15 well the problem

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
those two numbers is 15 well the problem
is<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.760> when<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> add<00:01:00.030> x<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> y<00:01:00.809> together

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
is that when you add x and y together

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
is that when you add x and y together
you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.469> add<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> any<00:01:01.980> order<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you can add them in any order but if

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
you can add them in any order but if
you're<00:01:03.660> subtracting<00:01:03.989> them<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.769> you're<00:01:04.890> taking

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you're subtracting them if you're taking

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're subtracting them if you're taking
the<00:01:05.339> difference<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.390> need<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.869> which

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the difference you need to know which

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
the difference you need to know which
number<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> larger<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.820> answer

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
number is larger so that your answer

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
number is larger so that your answer
comes<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> positive<00:01:10.020> 15<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.880> they

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
comes out as a positive 15 so if they

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450 
comes out as a positive 15 so if they
tell<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.540> x<00:01:12.780> represents<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.680> larger<00:01:14.070> number

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
tell you x represents the larger number

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
tell you x represents the larger number
then<00:01:15.330> X<00:01:16.009> minus<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.460> smaller<00:01:17.759> Y<00:01:18.180> value<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
then X minus the smaller Y value is

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
then X minus the smaller Y value is
going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> equal<00:01:20.250> 15<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> translating<00:01:23.520> those

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
going to equal 15 so translating those

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to equal 15 so translating those
two<00:01:24.180> English<00:01:24.750> sentences<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.590> mathematical

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
two English sentences into mathematical

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.719 
two English sentences into mathematical
sentences<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.210> half<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.900> problem<00:01:28.530> once<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
sentences is half the problem once you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.390 
sentences is half the problem once you
get<00:01:29.939> those<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.450> equations<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.770> call<00:01:32.009> in

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
get those two equations what we call in

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.260 
get those two equations what we call in
chapter<00:01:32.909> 4<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.470> system<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> equations<00:01:35.270> solving

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
chapter 4 a system of equations solving

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.260 
chapter 4 a system of equations solving
them<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.540> relatively<00:01:37.020> easy<00:01:37.549> these<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.880> set<00:01:39.119> up

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
them is relatively easy these are set up

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
them is relatively easy these are set up
nicely<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.990> solved<00:01:40.500> by<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> method<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
nicely to be solved by the method that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.230 
nicely to be solved by the method that
we<00:01:41.790> called<00:01:43.250> elimination<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.520> addition<00:01:45.030> method

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
we called elimination or addition method

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.429 
we called elimination or addition method
what<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.790> add<00:01:48.049> those<00:01:49.049> equations

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
what we do is we add those equations

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
what we do is we add those equations
together<00:01:50.090> straight<00:01:51.090> down<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.600> columns<00:01:51.990> x<00:01:52.970> plus

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
together straight down in columns x plus

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.020 
together straight down in columns x plus
x<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.770> 2x<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.930> positive<00:01:58.320> y<00:01:58.890> plus<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> negative

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
x is 2x but positive y plus a negative

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
x is 2x but positive y plus a negative
why<00:02:00.479> those<00:02:01.049> Y<00:02:01.350> values<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> cancel

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
why those Y values are going to cancel

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.020 
why those Y values are going to cancel
and<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.350> limit

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and so your limit

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.559 
and so your limit
a<00:02:05.860> one<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.950> your<00:02:07.100> variables<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.940> you're<00:02:08.479> going

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
a one of your variables and you're going

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.930 
a one of your variables and you're going
to<00:02:08.630> have<00:02:08.840> only<00:02:08.990> one<00:02:09.289> variable<00:02:09.649> X<00:02:11.980> at<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.250> right

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
to have only one variable X at the right

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.970 
to have only one variable X at the right
sides<00:02:14.270> too<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.020> that's<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> thing<00:02:15.920> that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
sides too and that's the thing that

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590 
sides too and that's the thing that
students<00:02:16.459> will<00:02:16.550> tend<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.880> forget<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.420> get

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
students will tend to forget they get

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.360 
students will tend to forget they get
distracted<00:02:17.990> by<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.410> over<00:02:18.860> there<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.280> they

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
distracted by this over there and they

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.300 
distracted by this over there and they
forget<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.910> add<00:02:20.060> these<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.560> 25<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> 15<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:23.750> 40

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
forget to add these up 25 and 15 is 40

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.710 
forget to add these up 25 and 15 is 40
so<00:02:25.310> now<00:02:25.520> we've<00:02:25.760> got<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> single<00:02:26.390> variable

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
so now we've got a single variable

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.620 
so now we've got a single variable
equation<00:02:27.560> using<00:02:27.830> elimination<00:02:28.280> method<00:02:29.150> we've

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
equation using elimination method we've

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.479 
equation using elimination method we've
gotten<00:02:30.020> rid<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.560> our<00:02:30.739> variables<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
gotten rid of one of our variables and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.550 
gotten rid of one of our variables and
we've<00:02:31.910> got<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> single<00:02:32.540> variable<00:02:32.660> equation<00:02:33.410> in

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
we've got a single variable equation in

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.860 
we've got a single variable equation in
terms<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.950> X<00:02:34.190> well<00:02:35.060> that's<00:02:35.239> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.540> real

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
terms of X well that's going to be real

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320 
terms of X well that's going to be real
easy<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.260> solve<00:02:36.530> we<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.550> divide<00:02:37.910> through<00:02:38.300> by

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
easy to solve we just divide through by

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.560 
easy to solve we just divide through by
2<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.900> undo<00:02:39.260> multiplication<00:02:39.680> by<00:02:40.220> 2<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.390> get

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
2 to undo multiplication by 2 and we get

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.070 
2 to undo multiplication by 2 and we get
x<00:02:41.720> equals<00:02:41.870> point<00:02:43.209> but<00:02:44.209> we're<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.570> done<00:02:44.840> with

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
x equals point but we're not done with

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
x equals point but we're not done with
the<00:02:45.230> problem<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.850> fact<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:48.260> question

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
the problem because in fact the question

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.930 
the problem because in fact the question
asks<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.050> solve<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.590> system<00:02:51.830> you're<00:02:52.730> not

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
asks you to solve the system you're not

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.720 
asks you to solve the system you're not
just<00:02:52.970> solving<00:02:53.630> for<00:02:53.900> x<00:02:53.950> you're<00:02:54.950> solving<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:55.459> x

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
just solving for x you're solving for x

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.160 
just solving for x you're solving for x
and<00:02:56.180> y<00:02:57.160> but<00:02:58.160> luckily<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.819> have<00:02:59.300> equations<00:02:59.690> that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
and y but luckily we have equations that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.040 
and y but luckily we have equations that
we<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.500> throw<00:03:00.769> ex<00:03:00.980> back<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.940> find<00:03:02.239> y<00:03:02.480> and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
we can throw ex back into to find y and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.190 
we can throw ex back into to find y and
so<00:03:03.860> let's<00:03:04.100> erase<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.880> original<00:03:05.360> instruction

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.190 

and<00:03:09.200> let's<00:03:09.440> use<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.920> x<00:03:10.130> value<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:11.200> this

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and let's use the x value in this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
and let's use the x value in this
original<00:03:12.560> equation<00:03:12.950> X<00:03:13.700> plus<00:03:14.180> y<00:03:14.420> equals<00:03:14.720> 25<00:03:15.820> to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
original equation X plus y equals 25 to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.900 
original equation X plus y equals 25 to
find<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.239> Y<00:03:17.420> value<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.739> know<00:03:18.890> X<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.370> 20<00:03:19.730> we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
find the Y value so we know X is 20 we

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.979 
find the Y value so we know X is 20 we
can<00:03:20.540> replace<00:03:20.900> X<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.590> original<00:03:21.829> equation

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
can replace X in that original equation

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.170 
can replace X in that original equation
and<00:03:23.989> solve<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.650> for<00:03:24.860> y<00:03:26.049> if<00:03:27.049> x<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.739> 20<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.400> why<00:03:29.120> is

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
and solve it for y if x is 20 and why is

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.830 
and solve it for y if x is 20 and why is
unknown<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.739> get<00:03:31.010> Y<00:03:31.400> standing<00:03:31.970> alone<00:03:32.209> by

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
unknown we can get Y standing alone by

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.360 
unknown we can get Y standing alone by
subtracting<00:03:33.440> 20<00:03:34.010> from<00:03:35.000> both<00:03:35.209> sides<00:03:35.769> we<00:03:36.769> get<00:03:36.980> y

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
subtracting 20 from both sides we get y

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.440 
subtracting 20 from both sides we get y
equals<00:03:38.950> 25-20<00:03:40.390> or<00:03:41.390> five<00:03:42.910> now<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:43.970> way<00:03:44.239> we

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
equals 25-20 or five now the way we

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.960 
equals 25-20 or five now the way we
wrote<00:03:44.630> our<00:03:44.660> answers<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.410> chapter<00:03:45.799> four<00:03:46.070> was<00:03:46.760> as

you<00:03:54.260> could<00:03:54.530> write<00:03:54.709> your<00:03:54.769> answer<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.430> this

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
you could write your answer to this

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.800 
you could write your answer to this
problem<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:56.510> an<00:03:56.900> ordered<00:03:57.290> pair<00:03:57.549> 20<00:03:58.870> comma<00:04:00.010> 5

and that answer represents both of your
solutions<00:04:06.880> or<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.930> could<00:04:08.080> just<00:04:08.110> write<00:04:08.470> it<00:04:08.650> as

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
solutions or you could just write it as

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.000 
solutions or you could just write it as
x<00:04:09.010> equals<00:04:09.400> 20<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.940> y<00:04:10.090> equals<00:04:10.450> 5<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.020> box<00:04:11.680> those

x equals 20 and y equals 5 and box those

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.190 
x equals 20 and y equals 5 and box those
but<00:04:12.849> it's<00:04:13.000> usually<00:04:13.150> better<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.660> write<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.080> as

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
but it's usually better to write it as

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.800 
but it's usually better to write it as
an<00:04:14.319> ordered<00:04:14.650> pair<00:04:15.419> when<00:04:16.419> you're<00:04:16.570> done<00:04:16.780> with

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
an ordered pair when you're done with

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.170 
an ordered pair when you're done with
the<00:04:17.109> problem<00:04:17.590> your<00:04:18.010> answer<00:04:18.400> should<00:04:18.639> check<00:04:18.970> the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the problem your answer should check the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.810 
the problem your answer should check the
original<00:04:19.690> conditions<00:04:20.200> do<00:04:21.160> those<00:04:21.340> two<00:04:21.609> numbers

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
original conditions do those two numbers

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.510 
original conditions do those two numbers
added<00:04:22.330> together<00:04:22.450> give<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.020> 25<00:04:23.560> they<00:04:24.070> sure<00:04:24.310> do

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
added together give you 25 they sure do

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.870 
added together give you 25 they sure do
does<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.630> larger<00:04:26.080> one<00:04:26.290> x<00:04:26.560> minus<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.639> smaller

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
does the larger one x minus the smaller

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.320 
does the larger one x minus the smaller
one<00:04:28.210> equal<00:04:28.540> 50<00:04:28.960> well<00:04:29.590> 20<00:04:29.919> minus<00:04:30.130> 5<00:04:30.460> equals<00:04:30.490> 15

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
one equal 50 well 20 minus 5 equals 15

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.510 
one equal 50 well 20 minus 5 equals 15
so<00:04:31.840> that's<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.169> real<00:04:32.380> easy<00:04:32.620> problem<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.190> check

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
so that's a real easy problem to check

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.550 
so that's a real easy problem to check
once<00:04:33.790> we're<00:04:34.000> done<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.450> if<00:04:34.990> you're<00:04:35.139> taking<00:04:35.470> the

once we're done and if you're taking the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.129 
once we're done and if you're taking the
final<00:04:35.740> exam<00:04:36.190> every<00:04:36.550> problem<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.450> checks<00:04:37.870> for
