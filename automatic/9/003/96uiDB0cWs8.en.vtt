00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
day

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.559 
day
I<00:03:01.519> wouldn't<00:03:02.519> recommend<00:03:02.639> masala<00:03:03.150> chai<00:03:03.359> for<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
I wouldn't recommend masala chai for a

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.110 
I wouldn't recommend masala chai for a
summer<00:03:03.780> day<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:05.519> would<00:03:05.639> kind<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:05.909> do<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
summer day at all you would kind of do a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.009 
summer day at all you would kind of do a
different<00:03:06.450> formula<00:03:06.870> then<00:03:07.049> as<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:09.389> tea<00:03:09.870> is

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
different formula then as the tea is

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.890 
different formula then as the tea is
getting<00:03:10.169> heated<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:12.889> take<00:03:13.889> about<00:03:14.669> 3/4<00:03:15.540> of

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
getting heated up you take about 3/4 of

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.479 
getting heated up you take about 3/4 of
a<00:03:16.590> glass<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.829> milk<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.299> whole<00:03:18.569> milk<00:03:19.430> ok<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
a glass of milk this is whole milk ok so

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.670 
a glass of milk this is whole milk ok so
now<00:03:20.909> you<00:03:21.299> can<00:03:21.629> see<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.959> chai<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.200> getting

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
now you can see the chai is getting

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.559 
now you can see the chai is getting
heated<00:03:22.859> up<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.849> in<00:03:24.000> fact<00:03:24.150> coming<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
heated up here it's in fact coming to a

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.229 
heated up here it's in fact coming to a
boil<00:03:24.799> pretty<00:03:25.799> close<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.669> point<00:03:26.909> where<00:03:27.090> we

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
boil pretty close to the point where we

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.640 
boil pretty close to the point where we
want<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.540> actually<00:03:27.840> add<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.409> milk<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.440> now<00:03:31.590> we

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
want to actually add the milk so now we

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.229 
want to actually add the milk so now we
are<00:03:31.949> going<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.190> add<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.599> milk<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.939> yes<00:03:35.939> go

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.770 

now<00:03:43.049> we<00:03:43.829> have<00:03:43.919> got<00:03:44.040> along<00:03:44.310> again<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:45.329> setting

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
now we have got along again the setting

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.050 
now we have got along again the setting
the<00:03:46.019> temperature<00:03:46.379> setting<00:03:46.829> continues<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.760> be

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the temperature setting continues to be

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.849 
the temperature setting continues to be
the<00:03:48.299> same<00:03:48.689> so<00:03:49.439> you<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.739> allow<00:03:49.979> it<00:03:50.009> to<00:03:50.359> now<00:03:51.859> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
the same so you just allow it to now the

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.979 
the same so you just allow it to now the
milk<00:03:53.069> too<00:03:53.310> cannot<00:03:54.090> come<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.449> room<00:03:54.750> temperature

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
milk too cannot come to room temperature

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.189 
milk too cannot come to room temperature
and<00:03:55.229> boil<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:55.889> well<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.729> mean<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.540> milk<00:03:57.720> came

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
and boil as well I mean the milk came

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.619 
and boil as well I mean the milk came
out<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.560> refrigerator<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.729> it's<00:04:00.389> going<00:04:00.569> to

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
out of the refrigerator so it's going to

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.770 
out of the refrigerator so it's going to
take<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> few<00:04:01.019> minutes<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:02.120> come<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.269> boil<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:06.389> as

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
take a few minutes to come to boil so as

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.369 
take a few minutes to come to boil so as
you<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.049> see<00:04:07.109> now<00:04:07.379> it's<00:04:07.650> coming<00:04:08.009> to<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.189> boil<00:04:09.379> so

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
you can see now it's coming to a boil so

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.379 
you can see now it's coming to a boil so
now<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.859> pretty<00:04:11.159> much<00:04:11.250> ready<00:04:11.669> you're

I don't know 10 seconds for it to be on

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.510 
I don't know 10 seconds for it to be on
and<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.820> take<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.150> off<00:04:21.269> pretty<00:04:22.139> much<00:04:22.490> we<00:04:23.490> just

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.040 
tea is much less acidic than coffee
actually<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.250> it's<00:04:44.240> it's<00:04:44.570> just<00:04:44.690> much<00:04:45.020> easier

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
actually so it's it's just much easier

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.980 
actually so it's it's just much easier
on<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.590> stomach<00:04:45.620> but<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:47.450> longer<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> keep

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
on the stomach but the longer you keep

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.290 
on the stomach but the longer you keep
it<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.560> little<00:04:48.920> more<00:04:49.160> acidic<00:04:49.910> sort<00:04:50.180> of

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
it the little more acidic sort of

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.660 
it the little more acidic sort of
quality<00:04:50.900> takes<00:04:51.200> on<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.130> also<00:04:52.250> makes<00:04:52.550> it

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
quality takes on but it also makes it

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.360 
quality takes on but it also makes it
actually<00:04:52.760> very<00:04:53.210> tasty<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:53.890> even<00:04:54.890> milk<00:04:55.130> when

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
actually very tasty so even milk when

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.780 
actually very tasty so even milk when
you<00:04:55.400> kind<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> boil<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.660> for<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.870> little<00:04:57.020> longer

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
you kind of boil it for a little longer

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.130 
you kind of boil it for a little longer
takes<00:04:58.790> on<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.000> slightly<00:04:59.180> different<00:04:59.570> taste<00:04:59.930> and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
takes on a slightly different taste and

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.590 
takes on a slightly different taste and
quality<00:05:00.260> compared<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.040> when<00:05:01.430> it's<00:05:01.610> not<00:05:01.880> cooked

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
quality compared to when it's not cooked

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.010 
quality compared to when it's not cooked
very<00:05:02.900> well<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:04.610> kind<00:05:04.700> of<00:05:04.910> based<00:05:05.780> on

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
very well so it's kind of based on

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990 
very well so it's kind of based on
individual<00:05:06.980> preference<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.550> something<00:05:07.880> that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
individual preference is something that

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.150 
individual preference is something that
you<00:05:08.090> learn<00:05:08.300> after<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.830> make<00:05:10.040> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
you learn after you you know make the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.250 
you learn after you you know make the
tea<00:05:10.310> for<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> few<00:05:10.790> times<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:14.780> is<00:05:14.960> pretty<00:05:15.140> much

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
tea for a few times this is pretty much

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.710 
tea for a few times this is pretty much
ready<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:15.860> as<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.070> can<00:05:16.190> see<00:05:16.300> we<00:05:17.300> turned<00:05:17.600> off

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
ready so as you can see we turned off

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.240 
ready so as you can see we turned off
the<00:05:17.840> burner<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.170> so<00:05:18.710> now<00:05:18.770> it's<00:05:18.980> kind<00:05:19.190> of

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
the burner and so now it's kind of

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.190 
the burner and so now it's kind of
things<00:05:19.490> are<00:05:19.580> cooling<00:05:19.790> down<00:05:19.880> a<00:05:20.150> little<00:05:20.270> bit<00:05:20.420> the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
things are cooling down a little bit the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.680 
things are cooling down a little bit the
other<00:05:21.230> thing<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.890> know<00:05:21.980> as<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.160> boil<00:05:22.610> it

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
other thing is you know as you boil it

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.830 
other thing is you know as you boil it
what<00:05:23.690> happens<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:25.180> water<00:05:26.180> evaporates

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
what happens is the the water evaporates

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.320 
what happens is the the water evaporates
so<00:05:27.140> it<00:05:27.440> kind<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:27.740> makes<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.160> milk<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.820> tea

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
so it kind of makes the milk the tea

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.730 
so it kind of makes the milk the tea
thicker<00:05:29.810> so<00:05:30.440> which<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.370> personally<00:05:31.850> like<00:05:32.740> so

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
thicker so which I personally like so

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.760 
thicker so which I personally like so
now<00:05:33.980> we<00:05:34.040> are<00:05:34.520> ready<00:05:35.060> to<00:05:35.320> filter<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.440> tea

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
now we are ready to filter the tea

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.190 
now we are ready to filter the tea
it's<00:05:36.890> going<00:05:37.730> into<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.940> tea<00:05:38.060> cup<00:05:38.330> now<00:05:38.510> as<00:05:38.750> you

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
it's going into the tea cup now as you

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.650 
it's going into the tea cup now as you
can<00:05:39.350> see<00:05:39.500> so<00:05:39.820> this<00:05:40.820> is<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:41.390> steel

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
can see so this is just this steel

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.580 
can see so this is just this steel
filter<00:05:42.760> for<00:05:43.760> making<00:05:44.540> sure<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.230> liquid

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
filter for making sure that the liquid

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.070 
filter for making sure that the liquid
and<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.920> ginger<00:05:46.390> etc<00:05:47.390> doesn't<00:05:47.690> get<00:05:47.810> into<00:05:47.960> the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
and the ginger etc doesn't get into the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.370 
and the ginger etc doesn't get into the
the<00:05:48.350> cups<00:05:49.040> so<00:05:49.880> there<00:05:50.030> you<00:05:50.180> have<00:05:50.210> it<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:51.170> this

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
the cups so there you have it so this

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.710 
the cups so there you have it so this
kind<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.830> actually<00:05:52.220> this<00:05:52.340> tea<00:05:52.550> will<00:05:52.730> actually

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
kind of actually this tea will actually

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.500 
kind of actually this tea will actually
work<00:05:53.930> for<00:05:54.230> three<00:05:54.410> people<00:05:54.560> because<00:05:55.390> you<00:05:56.390> know
