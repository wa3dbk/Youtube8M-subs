00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 trick shots that was invented by faith 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.530
 badly at the time of modern 2 so we 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.539
 can call it hot trouble while 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.370
 the hot equipment sincerely wanted 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.940
 give the name you want and actually 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 it's a little glitch that consisted of 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.809
 so that's how I just did it in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.609
 made to keep his equipment in the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.960
 game can reload I can do 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.640
 a lot of things and in fact it's in 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.649
 does this glyph work with all 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.269
 equipment ie the knife of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.290
 launch the scene takes jacques the dead 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.760
 the fragmentation c4 even the stupidity I 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 will show you that in the rest of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.160
 video 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 so here I really invite you 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.940
 look especially it's really something 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 nice it's really cool and I think 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.240
 at the end of the tutorial everything they 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 have watched will really become 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 dads of trouble to chott so that's well 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.830
 listen good see you right away for 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 the explanations 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.400
 and we end up for the rest of 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.560
 tutorial so in this part of the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.330
 video I want a little you expose yourself 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.730
 the conditions you need for 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.840
 realize my there so there is nothing 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.520
 complicated but you still have to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.150
 listen then I explain to you 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.560
 it's right now 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.900
 so in fact first of all you have to create 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.550
 a class with a lens knife and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.860
 tricks good trigger 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.170
 deadly silence a sniper and in 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060
 secondary I advise you to put 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.770
 to put a tuning pistol so you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.750
 have copied this class multiple times 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.050
 like that forgive it copy them this 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.000
 class several times like that this is 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.100
 so actually in the first class 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.270
 you will have one side to throw and in the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.800
 other than in the other classes you 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.620
 are going to replace an expensive launched by a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.850
 dead key for example or c4 or whatever 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.310
 so you want according to the equipment 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.209
 that you want to use okay is in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.130
 do his classes will serve us 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.130
 then to realize the mast the fall 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.900
 how to hurt has fallen to all and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.730
 I explained to you it is rather 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 complicated it's a matter of sync 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.580
 so you're not surprised if you get there 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.590
 not first time 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 then I explain immediately in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.620
 big firstly you take your 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.570
 class had cost two colas throws 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.040
 that gave you the money from the account at 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.230
 countdown renault countdown 17 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 start or play if they want to press with 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.680
 the markets modeled his texts rabbit and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.640
 where you go so much about ard 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.730
 kozak 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.610
 So here is May 6 on ps3 it is 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 believe and cross and 1,2 here that if my 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.430
 memories are good and basically 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.800
 really a synchrony when you 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 take the class and at the same time you 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.980
 start your technically and so that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.110
 we made this bug 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.940
 so you see it's not very complicated 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.110
 but I assure you that really you 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.340
 delight in galleys and so some 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.460
 wanted to arrive the first time 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.660
 others for not getting there at all 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.520
 overflows less than 25 euros 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.830
 even if those who are on lisbon who 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.270
 benefit more because because 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.220
 the buttons are much closer 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.660
 so there hang on a lot more 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 quickly and simply 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.990
 so if you want on ps3 I can you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.820
 to say I was on ps3 I really 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.800
 galley between what's coming out on xbox 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.130
 normally it should not be too bad 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.090
 pass 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.090
 so here we go 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.640
 here to end in beauty this video 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.500
 I will still give you some 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.750
 personal advice to help you 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.180
 have trouble with the misfortune so 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.349
 So here initially be 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 know that you can ask 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.360
 the bomb 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.129
 so on this point there is no 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 problem is especially for the rest 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.549
 it's going to be very interesting 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.170
 that already you can not run 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.660
 so from the moment you run 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.519
 and that's it and that you stop from 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.849
 running it's going to cancel the misfortune 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.349
 you can not make a stab 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.150
 you can not sent either 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.989
 of equipment to use it steals crutch 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.859
 again your dead key etc you can 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.550
 not sent two paralyzing shot 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.760
 no flash etc and you have to avoid to 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.400
 any price explosions or flashes 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.740
 paralyzing them so any kind 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.930
 of explosion will make you buggy 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.729
 so that's really the most 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.520
 annoying the clever especially when 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.199
 someone you tron ​​with you three one 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.550

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.320
 it belongs to him I can tell you it's me 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.000
 did it a lot of times that did not make me 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.220
 bad rage and so here we are going to listen 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.389
 I hope you enjoyed this video
