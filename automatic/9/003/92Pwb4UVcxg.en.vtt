see what the cheapest big bar is I can

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.449 
see what the cheapest big bar is I can
find<00:03:51.379> and<00:03:52.659> hey-o<00:03:53.659> p.m.<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:56.599> in<00:03:56.780> my<00:03:56.959> budget

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
find and hey-o p.m. so just in my budget

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.220 
find and hey-o p.m. so just in my budget
1859<00:03:59.170> and<00:04:00.489> what<00:04:01.489> will<00:04:01.670> they<00:04:01.790> buy<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.329> back<00:04:02.599> at

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.500 

the<00:04:06.230> cell<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.769> us<00:04:06.950> price<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:08.530> 1810<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:11.120> at

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
the cell to us price is 1810 and so at

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.530 
the cell to us price is 1810 and so at
spot<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.560> 1810<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.549> we<00:04:13.700> know<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.879> couple<00:04:14.150> things

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
spot is 1810 so we know a couple things

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.920 
spot is 1810 so we know a couple things
we<00:04:15.379> know<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.940> when<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:16.970> go<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.269> sell<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.750> back

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
we know that when I go to sell it back

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.629 
we know that when I go to sell it back
to<00:04:17.959> them<00:04:18.289> but<00:04:18.709> they're<00:04:18.979> going<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.190> give<00:04:19.400> me

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
to them but they're going to give me

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.020 
to them but they're going to give me
just<00:04:20.180> flat-out<00:04:20.509> spot<00:04:21.139> for<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.610> let's<00:04:22.820> do

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
just flat-out spot for that so let's do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.529 
just flat-out spot for that so let's do
some<00:04:23.570> math<00:04:23.720> with<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:25.759> so<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.419> this

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
some math with that so so in this

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.760 
some math with that so so in this
situation<00:04:26.780> i<00:04:27.550> had<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.880> hundred<00:04:29.840> ounces<00:04:30.410> i<00:04:30.590> was

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
situation i had a hundred ounces i was

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.990 
situation i had a hundred ounces i was
able<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.160> acquire<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.380> goes<00:04:33.590> up<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.669> dollar

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
able to acquire if it goes up one dollar

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.850 
able to acquire if it goes up one dollar
that<00:04:35.780> means<00:04:36.099> 1910<00:04:37.099> so<00:04:37.669> let's<00:04:38.229> multiply<00:04:39.229> that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
that means 1910 so let's multiply that

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.100 
that means 1910 so let's multiply that
times<00:04:40.510> 1910<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:45.320> see<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.650> comes<00:04:45.919> out<00:04:46.099> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
times 1910 and you see that comes out to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.920 
times 1910 and you see that comes out to
1910<00:04:48.110> dollars<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.490> when<00:04:50.000> silver<00:04:50.479> went<00:04:50.690> up<00:04:50.810> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
1910 dollars so when silver went up a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.839 
1910 dollars so when silver went up a
dollar<00:04:51.169> if<00:04:51.620> i<00:04:51.889> would<00:04:52.070> have<00:04:52.099> bought<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.460> silver

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
dollar if i would have bought the silver

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.300 
dollar if i would have bought the silver
eagles<00:04:53.270> i<00:04:53.479> would<00:04:53.750> i<00:04:54.169> would<00:04:54.530> have<00:04:54.889> been<00:04:55.010> able<00:04:55.130> to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
eagles i would i would have been able to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.939 
eagles i would i would have been able to
sell<00:04:55.580> them<00:04:55.789> back<00:04:56.000> for<00:04:56.300> less<00:04:56.690> than<00:04:57.320> eighteen

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
sell them back for less than eighteen

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.460 
sell them back for less than eighteen
hundred<00:04:58.340> dollars<00:04:58.729> but<00:04:59.360> i'll<00:04:59.570> be<00:04:59.780> able<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.169> sell

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
hundred dollars but i'll be able to sell

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.490 
hundred dollars but i'll be able to sell
this<00:05:00.740> bar<00:05:01.159> back<00:05:01.460> for<00:05:01.940> more<00:05:02.270> than<00:05:02.750> 1,900

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
this bar back for more than 1,900

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.580 
this bar back for more than 1,900
dollars<00:05:04.310> that's<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.599> big<00:05:05.810> difference<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:06.560> i

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
dollars that's the big difference that i

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.839 
dollars that's the big difference that i
think<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.919> lot<00:05:06.949> of<00:05:07.130> people<00:05:07.419> don't<00:05:08.620> understand

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
think a lot of people don't understand

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.860 
think a lot of people don't understand
their<00:05:10.849> can<00:05:11.630> definitely<00:05:12.110> be<00:05:12.320> an<00:05:12.620> advantage<00:05:13.009> in

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
their can definitely be an advantage in

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.189 
their can definitely be an advantage in
purchasing<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.229> lower<00:05:15.710> premium<00:05:16.900> larger<00:05:17.900> bars
