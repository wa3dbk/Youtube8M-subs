 they are putting him into the field that leave you 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.199
 obviously this is for the version in 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.300
 this 0.9 point one is going we are using the 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.619
 launcher pro and the stable version all 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.390
 down here in the description also the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.980
 download link so that in this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.010
 case is from the forum as you can see 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.769
 here are the bases of this page 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.150
 obviously with this link and then 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.559
 good are the two options is not in 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.120
 English and in Spanish obviously I think 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.649
 that you know how to create in Spanish carnal and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.719
 good as it is that this works not for 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.430
 those who do not know good will appear 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.040
 here this is not what the lawyer is 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.280
 one touch and we will appear all the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.690
 the achievements or the mens archives that we have 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.120
 to go getting along from the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.789
 game is not like to add a 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 little bit more flavor to alaan minecraft 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.949
 not to do it is also so common not 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.359
 then good are different achievements 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.399
 they go blue every time you go 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.199
 doing though as you can see if they are 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.590
 quite and everything 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.180
 So, well, I tell you, they put on 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.909
 blue or purple I do not know which one 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.539
 depending on whether there is no longer one 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.530
 of each one has that is doing this 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.750
 so I made a mistake this channel in 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.670
 manises a kiss through was any 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.289
 young woman or for example can not anymore 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450
 have done that by getting wood if 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.100
 I would not have done this before everyone goes 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.990
 have the one that follows you have to have 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.969
 done everything you can say an achievement for 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.720
 to be able to do the one that does carry here 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.730
 example I'm going to do the one to work 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 which is to elaborate a work bank or 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.570
 be a table of character and here look 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.480
 as it says it requires getting wood 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 that is ok though obviously make a 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.090
 long to make a decrepit table 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.610
 I have to grab wood we're on 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.410
 agreement so each one has to give 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 how linked are you can not do this if 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
 we made this you can not do subject 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.230
 hot if we miss the time to mine 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 good jazz then good for you to see 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.310
 how does this work here we are going to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.770
 make the search table and when the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.150
 we have it is going to put us here he 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 as if we had already given and says 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.869
 did not get obtained to work like this is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.670
 easy to offer to carry we're going to do 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.959
 the now mine that is to use 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 boards and clubs to make a pick and 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.770
 required the to work is logical not 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.090
 you need the kraft table then 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.850
 we know the peak and it will look like 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.530
 again the poster this that says achievement 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 obtained then it is good that not 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.770
 there's nothing more to be said 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.980
