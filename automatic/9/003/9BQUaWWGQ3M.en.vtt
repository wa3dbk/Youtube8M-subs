 and it costs 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 so why not 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 during his retirement 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.670
 the power 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 at the time the fall of the device 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 today their comments for all audiences of all ages 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 then the relay to talk about him 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 just like for the moment only water 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320

 far from his epilogue 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.859
 30% here is a pitch a possible cement rally 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.539
 that's all about finishing in the lead only in the oil 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.809
 I think he tried to run away 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.219
 1 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.169
 it 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.659
 following the attempt 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.109
 why wait 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.109
 that's why up without flinching in men's time 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.109
 around m 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.259
 that promises 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
 his orientation starts again 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.560

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 and muslims from Egypt flying over the tennis center 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.709
 his team a few minutes 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.709
 in free 2 we leave mark 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.979

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 we would believe as before because the models 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.829

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.779
 the most fabulous 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.119
 so we are waiting 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.249
 the share from oussama to grenoble 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.249
 provided with a debit 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.930
 Everyone knows it 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.689
 puncture dressings 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.959
 We are not the only ones 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.900
 resignation will prevail 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 they are anxious 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.449
 a rise in violence 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.849

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.110
 I believe at the end of clashes in the park 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.550
 to the fact that happens to them 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.949
 you had to see 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.949
 not serious 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.129
 how to evaluate the value 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 the reserve is a factor and not by the mark long 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.960
 finally it should be passed from the first phase 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.029
 the words of m 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.029
 except to his fleet 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.029

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.120
