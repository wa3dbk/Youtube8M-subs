this is a facelift 2002 320 and I saw

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.420 
this is a facelift 2002 320 and I saw
some<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:20.850> cables<00:00:21.270> break<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.020> side

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
some the cables break on this side

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.259 
some the cables break on this side
especially<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> louver

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
especially for this louver

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.990 
especially for this louver
for<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.070> cables<00:00:26.070> break<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.670> fall<00:00:26.880> off

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for the cables break or they fall off

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
for the cables break or they fall off
their<00:00:27.180> mounts<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.720> I've<00:00:28.160> now<00:00:29.160> looking<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
their mounts and I've now looking at the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
their mounts and I've now looking at the
other<00:00:29.849> seat<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.570> somewhat<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> an

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
other seat you can get somewhat of an

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
other seat you can get somewhat of an
idea<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.640> mechanism

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
idea of how it's just the mechanism

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.310 
idea of how it's just the mechanism
works<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.260> uh<00:00:35.329> on<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.540> side<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> little

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
works but uh on this side is a little

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.670 
works but uh on this side is a little
bit<00:00:37.530> different<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.670> cable<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.440> lever

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bit different the cable the lever

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
bit different the cable the lever
actually<00:00:41.219> pulls<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> cable<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> opposite

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
actually pulls the cable on the opposite

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
actually pulls the cable on the opposite
side<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:46.160> pushes<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> lever<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:50.239> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
side and it pushes on the lever and that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
side and it pushes on the lever and that
pulls<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.750> cable<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.590> pulls<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.399> lever

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
pulls a cable that also pulls this lever

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.380 
pulls a cable that also pulls this lever
on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.300> side<00:00:55.670> if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
on the other side if you can see that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.610 
on the other side if you can see that
very<00:00:57.629> well<00:00:57.719> what's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.190> different

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
very well what's a little bit different

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.090
