accessible and creative now people

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.830 
accessible and creative now people
flipped<00:00:58.520> out<00:00:58.760> over<00:00:58.790> there's<00:00:59.300> people<00:00:59.570> wanting

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840

flipped out over there's people wanting
good<00:01:00.110> people<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.469> crazy<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.309> was<00:01:01.460> ridiculous

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
good people and crazy it was ridiculous

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.359 
good people and crazy it was ridiculous
now<00:01:02.210> I<00:01:02.239> think<00:01:02.649> personally<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:04.219> the

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
now I think personally that the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.279 
now I think personally that the
developers<00:01:04.879> just<00:01:05.149> copy<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.780> pasted<00:01:06.170> this

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
developers just copy and pasted this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.870 
developers just copy and pasted this
from<00:01:06.350> versions<00:01:07.039> that<00:01:07.159> actually<00:01:07.670> have

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
from versions that actually have

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.789 
from versions that actually have
achievements<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:08.659> maybe<00:01:09.200> they<00:01:09.380> copy<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
achievements so maybe they copy and

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.319 
achievements so maybe they copy and
paste<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.069> from<00:01:10.219> the<00:01:10.399> PC<00:01:10.789> version<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.179> the<00:01:11.240> game

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
paste it from the PC version of the game

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.989 
paste it from the PC version of the game
I<00:01:11.780> think<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.100> does<00:01:13.369> not<00:01:13.399> mean<00:01:13.969> that

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:13.999 
I think that this does not mean that

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.760 
I think that this does not mean that
we're<00:01:14.299> getting<00:01:14.420> achievements<00:01:15.049> but<00:01:15.170> everyone

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
we're getting achievements but everyone

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.489 
we're getting achievements but everyone
went<00:01:15.979> crazy<00:01:16.280> people<00:01:17.119> started<00:01:17.509> going<00:01:18.079> nuts<00:01:18.259> it

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
went crazy people started going nuts it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.800 
went crazy people started going nuts it
was<00:01:18.649> awesome<00:01:19.279> to<00:01:19.399> see<00:01:19.429> but<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:20.119> don't<00:01:20.450> actually

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
was awesome to see but I don't actually

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.690 
was awesome to see but I don't actually
think<00:01:21.139> they're<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.249> be<00:01:22.340> adding

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
think they're going to be adding

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.489 
think they're going to be adding
achievements<00:01:23.149> anytime<00:01:23.600> soon<00:01:23.840> obviously<00:01:24.380> in

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
achievements anytime soon obviously in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.679 
achievements anytime soon obviously in
the<00:01:24.590> future<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.100> course<00:01:25.399> they<00:01:25.670> will<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.450> for

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
the future of course they will but for

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.629 
the future of course they will but for
now<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:26.899> think<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.679> was<00:01:27.859> just<00:01:27.889> copy<00:01:28.249> and<00:01:28.459> paste

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
now I think this was just copy and paste

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.129 
now I think this was just copy and paste
it<00:01:28.819> and<00:01:28.939> people<00:01:29.149> took<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.659> little<00:01:29.840> bit<00:01:29.990> too

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139

wasn't doing earlier and this is exactly

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.899 
wasn't doing earlier and this is exactly
what<00:01:51.349> he<00:01:51.560> should<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.889> doing<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:52.429> wherever<00:01:52.609> he

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
what he should be doing so wherever he

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.789 
what he should be doing so wherever he
goes<00:01:53.119> he'll<00:01:53.719> leave<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.990> trail<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.349> snow<00:01:54.529> so<00:01:54.679> if

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
goes he'll leave of trail of snow so if

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.649 
goes he'll leave of trail of snow so if
somehow<00:01:55.249> you<00:01:55.310> have<00:01:55.789> an<00:01:55.909> enclosure<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.569> he

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
somehow you have an enclosure and he

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.539 
somehow you have an enclosure and he
escapes<00:01:57.049> you'll<00:01:57.619> be<00:01:57.739> able<00:01:57.829> to<00:01:57.979> trace<00:01:58.189> him<00:01:58.369> down

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
escapes you'll be able to trace him down

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.039 
escapes you'll be able to trace him down
following<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.209> snow<00:01:59.419> it's<00:01:59.599> a<00:01:59.659> pretty<00:01:59.840> cool

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
following the snow it's a pretty cool

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.510 
following the snow it's a pretty cool
addition<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.560> think<00:02:00.739> it's<00:02:00.859> an<00:02:00.919> awesome<00:02:01.189> awesome

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
addition I think it's an awesome awesome

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.419 
addition I think it's an awesome awesome
feature<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.899> as<00:02:03.109> you<00:02:03.319> can<00:02:03.439> see<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> control

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
feature so as you can see in the control

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.979 
feature so as you can see in the control
section<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.209> the<00:02:05.299> update<00:02:05.569> we<00:02:05.659> now<00:02:05.810> have<00:02:05.959> a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
section of the update we now have a

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.839 
section of the update we now have a
button<00:02:06.439> size<00:02:06.679> slider<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.249> used<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.579> be<00:02:07.700> called

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
button size slider it used to be called

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.960 
button size slider it used to be called
control<00:02:08.450> or<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> d-pad<00:02:09.259> size<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.070> obviously

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
control or a d-pad size but obviously

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.630 
control or a d-pad size but obviously
now<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.450> changes<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:12.020> only<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.440> d-pad<00:02:12.830> also

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
now it changes not only the d-pad also

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.850 
now it changes not only the d-pad also
the<00:02:13.940> sneak<00:02:14.330> button

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the sneak button

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.500 
the sneak button
or<00:02:14.950> jump<00:02:15.280> button<00:02:15.550> depending<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.090> whatever<00:02:16.270> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
or jump button depending on whatever you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
or jump button depending on whatever you
have<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> set<00:02:16.990> as<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.190> call<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.610> a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
have it set as so now they call it a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.540 
have it set as so now they call it a
button<00:02:19.240> size<00:02:19.450> rather<00:02:19.930> than<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.680> d-pad<00:02:21.250> size

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
button size rather than just d-pad size

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.330 
button size rather than just d-pad size
so<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.750> works<00:02:23.230> pretty<00:02:23.500> well<00:02:23.800> also

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so that is that works pretty well also

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.090 
so that is that works pretty well also
one<00:02:25.120> pretty<00:02:25.450> cool<00:02:25.720> feature<00:02:26.080> seeds<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.980> now

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
one pretty cool feature seeds and now

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.640 
one pretty cool feature seeds and now
generate<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:28.210> more<00:02:28.240> randomly<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.350> there

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
generate a lot more randomly and there

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.440 
generate a lot more randomly and there
is<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.640> trick<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.240> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
is a little bit of a trick to this and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.450 
is a little bit of a trick to this and
I'll<00:02:31.540> explain<00:02:31.930> exactly<00:02:32.140> how<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.890> works<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
I'll explain exactly how this works so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.150 
I'll explain exactly how this works so
basically<00:02:34.030> prior<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.290> build<00:02:35.590> seeds

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
basically prior to this build seeds

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.700 
basically prior to this build seeds
would<00:02:36.430> generate<00:02:36.880> based<00:02:37.210> on<00:02:37.540> how<00:02:37.900> long<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.530> had

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
would generate based on how long you had

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.100 
would generate based on how long you had
your<00:02:38.890> device<00:02:39.190> open<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.300> say<00:02:40.600> if<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.810> had<00:02:40.990> your

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
your device open so say if you had your

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.199 
your device open so say if you had your
device<00:02:41.380> open<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.010> 15<00:02:42.520> seconds<00:02:43.090> before

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
device open for 15 seconds before

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.690 
device open for 15 seconds before
generating<00:02:43.690> your<00:02:43.990> world<00:02:44.220> anyone<00:02:45.220> else<00:02:45.400> who

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
generating your world anyone else who

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.699 
generating your world anyone else who
had<00:02:45.880> their<00:02:46.060> device<00:02:46.270> open<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:46.900> 15<00:02:47.290> seconds

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
had their device open for 15 seconds

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.410 
had their device open for 15 seconds
before<00:02:47.980> they<00:02:48.280> generated<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.760> world<00:02:48.940> would

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
before they generated the world would

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.570 
before they generated the world would
get<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.780> exact<00:02:50.380> same<00:02:50.800> seed<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> know

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
get the exact same seed as you know

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.920 
get the exact same seed as you know
obviously<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.060> not<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.480> simple

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
obviously it's not that simple

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.229 
obviously it's not that simple
but<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.590> basic<00:02:54.040> way<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.370> worked<00:02:54.880> now

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
but that's the basic way it worked now

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.660 
but that's the basic way it worked now
we<00:02:55.300> actually<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:56.320> completely<00:02:56.980> random<00:02:57.430> seeds

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
we actually get completely random seeds

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.100 
we actually get completely random seeds
because<00:02:58.030> before<00:02:58.390> everyone<00:02:58.840> was<00:02:58.989> getting

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
because before everyone was getting

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.449 
because before everyone was getting
seeds<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.190> hundreds<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:00.790> 300<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.540> for

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
seeds in the hundreds like 300 and for

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.250 
seeds in the hundreds like 300 and for
360<00:03:03.459> something<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.330> now<00:03:04.690> as<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.110> can

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
360 something like that now as you can

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.680 
360 something like that now as you can
see<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.890> seat<00:03:06.160> up<00:03:06.310> there<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:07.030> massive

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
see the seat up there is a massive

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.990 
see the seat up there is a massive
string<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.140> numbers<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.650> probably<00:03:09.340> there's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
string of numbers that probably there's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.979 
string of numbers that probably there's
a<00:03:10.090> good<00:03:10.239> chance<00:03:10.480> it's<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.930> be

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
a good chance it's not going to be

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.410 
a good chance it's not going to be
repeated<00:03:11.230> any<00:03:11.560> time<00:03:12.010> soon<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.640> yeah<00:03:13.090> more

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
repeated any time soon so yeah more

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.420 
repeated any time soon so yeah more
random<00:03:13.600> seeds<00:03:13.959> which<00:03:14.170> means<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.590> better<00:03:14.830> worlds

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
random seeds which means a better worlds

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.030 
random seeds which means a better worlds
and<00:03:15.580> more<00:03:15.760> unique<00:03:16.060> worlds<00:03:16.450> for<00:03:16.660> everyone<00:03:17.110> also

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
and more unique worlds for everyone also

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.699 
and more unique worlds for everyone also
one<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.150> coolest<00:03:19.840> features<00:03:19.959> within<00:03:20.530> this

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
one of the coolest features within this

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.370 
one of the coolest features within this
update<00:03:21.130> by<00:03:21.340> far<00:03:21.850> is<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.299> now<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.600> can<00:03:23.049> create

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
update by far is that now you can create

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.070 
update by far is that now you can create
custom<00:03:23.950> chests<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:24.940> how<00:03:25.570> do<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.810> do<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.989> you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
custom chests so how do you do that you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.600 
custom chests so how do you do that you
may<00:03:26.200> ask<00:03:26.320> what<00:03:26.530> lets<00:03:26.739> us<00:03:26.830> first<00:03:27.220> put<00:03:27.459> this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
may ask what lets us first put this

inside<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.080> block<00:05:06.320> which<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.620> pretty<00:05:07.040> sweet

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
inside of a block which is pretty sweet

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.730 
inside of a block which is pretty sweet
and<00:05:07.730> wither<00:05:08.270> skeletons<00:05:08.870> no<00:05:09.110> longer<00:05:09.530> fit

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
and wither skeletons no longer fit

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.410 
and wither skeletons no longer fit
through<00:05:09.980> doors<00:05:10.250> obviously<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.150> they<00:05:11.270> are

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
through doors obviously because they are

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.660 
through doors obviously because they are
a<00:05:11.450> little<00:05:11.840> bit<00:05:12.080> taller<00:05:12.350> than<00:05:12.590> normal<00:05:13.190> mob<00:05:13.370> so

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
a little bit taller than normal mob so

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.240 
a little bit taller than normal mob so
that<00:05:13.970> works<00:05:14.330> out<00:05:14.570> very<00:05:14.630> nicely<00:05:15.110> now<00:05:15.650> those<00:05:15.980> are

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
that works out very nicely now those are

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.280 
that works out very nicely now those are
most<00:05:16.580> of<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.820> tweaks<00:05:17.090> there<00:05:17.540> are<00:05:17.660> also<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:18.140> ton

most of the tweaks there are also a ton

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.060

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
build 9 and as you can see the bug fix

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.250 
build 9 and as you can see the bug fix
list<00:05:36.350> is<00:05:36.590> massive<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.550> is<00:05:37.700> huge<00:05:38.240> which<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.230> a

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
list is massive it is huge which is a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.470 
list is massive it is huge which is a
good<00:05:39.650> thing<00:05:39.950> as<00:05:40.220> far<00:05:40.250> as<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:40.820> update<00:05:41.210> goes

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
good thing as far as this update goes

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.330 
good thing as far as this update goes
because<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:42.050> means<00:05:42.230> that<00:05:42.410> more<00:05:42.800> things<00:05:43.100> are

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
because that means that more things are

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.420 
because that means that more things are
being<00:05:43.520> fixed<00:05:43.850> which<00:05:44.480> means<00:05:44.650> closer<00:05:45.650> or<00:05:46.010> closer

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
being fixed which means closer or closer

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.480 
being fixed which means closer or closer
to<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.670> release<00:05:46.970> date<00:05:47.030> simple<00:05:47.660> as<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:49.250> I'm

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
to a release date simple as that so I'm

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.880 
to a release date simple as that so I'm
not<00:05:49.520> exactly<00:05:50.060> sure<00:05:50.240> when<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.290> update<00:05:51.710> will

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
not exactly sure when this update will

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.130 
not exactly sure when this update will
come<00:05:52.070> out<00:05:52.220> but<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.460> know<00:05:52.610> as<00:05:53.000> we<00:05:53.300> see<00:05:53.540> more<00:05:53.570> and

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
come out but I know as we see more and

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.380 
come out but I know as we see more and
more<00:05:54.170> bug<00:05:54.530> fixes<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.220> less<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:55.670> less<00:05:55.730> tweaks

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
more bug fixes and less and less tweaks

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.450 
more bug fixes and less and less tweaks
that<00:05:56.720> means<00:05:57.410> we're<00:05:57.680> getting<00:05:57.980> closer<00:05:58.310> and

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
that means we're getting closer and

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.730 
that means we're getting closer and
closer<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.570> official<00:06:00.110> release<00:06:00.380> of<00:06:00.590> the
