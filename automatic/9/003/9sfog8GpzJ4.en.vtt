which<00:00:11.070> was<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.879> of<00:00:11.940> itself<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
which was a in and of itself that was a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.789 
which was a in and of itself that was a
really<00:00:12.629> fun<00:00:12.870> thing<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.080> explore<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.680> idea

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
really fun thing to explore the idea

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.560 
really fun thing to explore the idea
that<00:00:13.980> they've<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.400> kind<00:00:14.760> of<00:00:14.789> they've<00:00:15.330> become

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that they've all kind of they've become

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.529 
that they've all kind of they've become
very<00:00:15.980> accustomed<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.490> not<00:00:17.850> having<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.390> be

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
very accustomed to just not having to be

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.840 
very accustomed to just not having to be
at<00:00:18.630> war<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:20.220> even<00:00:20.460> discussed

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
at war all the time we even discussed

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.670 
at war all the time we even discussed
maybe<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.420> adults<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:21.930> stoic<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.470> gobber

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
maybe the adults like stoic and gobber

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.259 
maybe the adults like stoic and gobber
might<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.220> gotten<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.640> fat<00:00:23.999> they're

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
might have gotten really fat they're

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.029 
might have gotten really fat they're
just<00:00:24.419> kind<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.599> like<00:00:24.720> settling<00:00:25.140> into<00:00:25.410> their

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
just kind of like settling into their

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.790 
just kind of like settling into their
old<00:00:26.249> age<00:00:26.810> we<00:00:27.810> didn't<00:00:27.960> go<00:00:28.050> quite<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.259> far<00:00:28.439> but

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
old age we didn't go quite that far but

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
old age we didn't go quite that far but
but<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> idea<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.759> they<00:00:30.089> would<00:00:30.210> have

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
but the idea was that they would have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
but the idea was that they would have
much<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:30.960> leisure<00:00:31.439> time<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.160> would

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
much more leisure time that they would

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.630 
much more leisure time that they would
enjoy<00:00:32.430> life<00:00:32.880> more<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.310> does<00:00:35.489> open

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
enjoy life more and and it does open

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
enjoy life more and and it does open
with<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.090> taste<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.510> before<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with a little taste of that before the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890 
with a little taste of that before the
before<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> story<00:00:38.310> gets<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:39.120> really

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
before the story gets going really

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.810 
before the story gets going really
hiccup<00:00:41.260> just<00:00:41.440> simply<00:00:41.680> thinks<00:00:42.250> differently

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280 
so much time together they know each
other's<00:01:33.240> thought<00:01:34.240> processes<00:01:34.869> they've<00:01:35.020> got<00:01:35.200> to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
other's thought processes they've got to

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.320 
other's thought processes they've got to
the<00:01:35.380> point<00:01:35.530> where<00:01:35.710> they<00:01:35.860> can<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.640> know<00:01:36.670> fall

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
the point where they can you know fall

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.820 
the point where they can you know fall
off<00:01:37.360> one<00:01:37.540> another<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.200> trust<00:01:38.410> each<00:01:38.470> other<00:01:38.619> to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
off one another and trust each other to

off one another and trust each other to
catch<00:01:39.009> themselves<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:40.150> they<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.450> know

might<00:03:35.420> wind<00:03:35.780> up<00:03:36.250> wrestling<00:03:37.250> her<00:03:37.430> she<00:03:37.640> doesn't

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
might wind up wrestling her she doesn't

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.370 
might wind up wrestling her she doesn't
get<00:03:38.000> her<00:03:38.120> way<00:03:38.150> she<00:03:38.570> might<00:03:38.720> throw<00:03:38.990> him<00:03:39.080> around<00:03:39.140> a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
get her way she might throw him around a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.420 
get her way she might throw him around a
bit<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.770> kind<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> fun<00:03:40.220> thing<00:03:40.400> to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
bit it's just kind of a fun thing to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.310 
bit it's just kind of a fun thing to
play<00:03:40.520> with<00:03:40.820> because<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.060> it's<00:03:41.870> different

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
play with because it's it's different

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.050 
play with because it's it's different
you<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.680> not<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.910> not<00:03:44.000> a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
you know it's not it's not a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.260 
you know it's not it's not a
run-of-the-mill<00:03:44.690> cartoon<00:03:45.260> relationship

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
run-of-the-mill cartoon relationship

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.870 
run-of-the-mill cartoon relationship
so<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> Alpha<00:03:48.020> dragon<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.700> idea

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
so the Alpha dragon is just the idea

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.610 
so the Alpha dragon is just the idea
that<00:03:50.090> there's<00:03:50.390> there's<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.900> hierarchy<00:03:51.530> in

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
that there's there's this hierarchy in

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740 
that there's there's this hierarchy in
the<00:03:51.710> world<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:52.070> dragons<00:03:52.490> that<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.390> human

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the world of dragons that that human

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.890 
the world of dragons that that human
beings<00:03:54.050> only<00:03:54.740> are<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.850> starting<00:03:56.210> to<00:03:56.240> get<00:03:56.420> an

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
beings only are just starting to get an

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900 
beings only are just starting to get an
understanding<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.800> Valko<00:03:58.400> has<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.730> most

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
understanding of Valko has the most

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.070 
understanding of Valko has the most
understanding<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.630> because<00:03:59.780> she's<00:03:59.900> been

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
understanding of it because she's been

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.920 
understanding of it because she's been
living<00:04:00.220> alone<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.490> dragons<00:04:01.910> for<00:04:02.120> 20<00:04:02.720> years

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
living alone with dragons for 20 years

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.300

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
or so but she's learned about this

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.240 
or so but she's learned about this
hierarchy<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:07.910> she<00:04:08.060> knows<00:04:08.270> about<00:04:08.740> how<00:04:09.740> their

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
hierarchy and she knows about how their

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.470 
hierarchy and she knows about how their
pecking<00:04:10.490> order<00:04:10.910> works<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:13.460> then<00:04:14.390> of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
pecking order works and and then of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.850 
pecking order works and and then of
course<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.720> villain<00:04:15.080> has<00:04:15.320> learned<00:04:15.620> about

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
course the villain has learned about

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.979 
course the villain has learned about
this<00:04:16.100> as<00:04:16.250> well<00:04:16.489> but<00:04:16.790> he<00:04:17.000> uses<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.900> an

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
this as well but he uses it to an

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.960 
this as well but he uses it to an
advantage<00:04:18.440> he<00:04:18.620> uses<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.070> knowing<00:04:19.730> that<00:04:19.880> if

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
advantage he uses it knowing that if
