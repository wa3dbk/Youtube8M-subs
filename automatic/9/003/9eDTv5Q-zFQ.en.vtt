so<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:23.900> should<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.200> be<00:04:24.380> moving<00:04:24.770> towards

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
so we should really be moving towards

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.610 
so we should really be moving towards
renewable<00:04:25.669> energy<00:04:26.060> generation<00:04:26.290> we<00:04:27.290> know<00:04:27.440> that

renewable energy generation we know that

renewable energy is not just good for

renewable energy is not just good for

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
reducing our carbon emissions but it
