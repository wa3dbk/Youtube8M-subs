turn<00:02:04.750> cuz<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:06.079> need<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.259> second<00:02:06.829> gear

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
turn cuz then you need a second gear

turn cuz then you need a second gear
Nick<00:02:07.310> catch<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:08.599> back<00:02:09.049> on<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> power

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.250 

let's<00:02:12.799> go<00:02:13.010> through<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.340> again<00:02:14.019> second<00:02:15.019> gear

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
let's go through that again second gear

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.190 
let's go through that again second gear
this<00:02:15.470> time<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.390> approach<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.750> bend

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
this time and as you approach the bend

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.470 
this time and as you approach the bend
just<00:02:18.500> mix<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.610> hair<00:02:19.760> breakage<00:02:22.239> catch<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
just mix the hair breakage catch the

just mix the hair breakage catch the
slide<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> opposite<00:02:24.379> lock<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.849> then<00:02:26.150> back<00:02:26.450> of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
slide the opposite lock and then back of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.320 
slide the opposite lock and then back of
the<00:02:26.750> power<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.260> pull<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.709> car<00:02:27.950> straight

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.610 

now<00:02:34.330> though<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.720> may<00:02:34.960> have<00:02:35.110> looked<00:02:35.290> easy

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
now though that may have looked easy

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.100 
now though that may have looked easy
problem<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.670> because<00:02:36.910> you're<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.330> faster

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
problem is because you're going faster

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.180 
problem is because you're going faster
if<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.650> pull<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> handbrake<00:02:39.190> too<00:02:39.640> sharply

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
if you pull the handbrake too sharply

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780 
if you pull the handbrake too sharply
you<00:02:42.190> end<00:02:42.460> up<00:02:43.290> over<00:02:44.290> shooting<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.100> that's<00:02:45.580> no

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
you end up over shooting and that's no

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.250 
you end up over shooting and that's no
good<00:02:47.460> it's<00:02:48.460> simple<00:02:49.000> go<00:02:49.360> easy<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.050> hand

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
good it's simple go easy on the hand

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.990 
good it's simple go easy on the hand
brake<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.770> you'll<00:02:50.890> end<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.130> looking<00:02:51.640> at<00:02:51.730> where

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
brake or you'll end up looking at where

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.940 
brake or you'll end up looking at where
you've<00:02:52.240> just<00:02:52.480> come<00:02:52.720> from<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:56.230> if<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.740> don't

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
you've just come from then if you don't

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.320 
you've just come from then if you don't
put<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.340> sharp<00:02:57.670> enough

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.620 

you<00:03:04.080> end<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.310> grass<00:03:10.790> lots<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.970> space<00:03:12.360> to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
you end up on the grass lots of space to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:22.120 
you end up on the grass lots of space to
run<00:03:12.900> off<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.320> make<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> mistake<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> must

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.500 

then<00:03:23.130> if<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.460> think<00:03:23.760> you've<00:03:23.880> got<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.270> that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
then if you think you've got all that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.550 
then if you think you've got all that
fast<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:25.560> move<00:03:25.800> on<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.790> big<00:03:27.000> stuff

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
fast you can move on the big stuff
