 have you heard of the good konami code 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.349
 Before we say that, let's remember. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 some things about konami are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 a company that was founded in 1969 and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.869
 up to today it is very recognized in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.850
 Gamer, because it has already been very successful. 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.939
 including there in the past in the 1980s and 1990s. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.269
 with several releases of very 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269
 success 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 It's the name, it's fucking ending, coming back to the code. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.289
 konami there 85 if the garbage cracks the bike is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 65 is spoken Asian programmer of the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.760
 game god that soon left the famicom and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 I do not know if the game has a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 level of difficulty so high that he 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.260
 even invented the password for him this is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 He even gives clothes for example. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 and 30 lives is my friend but when launching 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.949
 game for some reason he did not remove the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 password 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.000
 there the code konami was born the code is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.150
 nothing more nothing less than above 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 low will be said that jb start and the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.070
 password continued and many games 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 the most popular one is against the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.240
 Little monkey that if you do win 30 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.240
 Focus on shea 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.310
 and type has an immense list of games of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 references to this code and against 1 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.570
 was the only game in the franchise he used 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.590
 this code has the worst chance of the game 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.439
 playstation 2 boy 2 on ds and hard 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.360
 corps that has been relaunched xbox 360 and 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.789
 playstation 3 also that when you 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.409
 performs that classic song in the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.390
 stage of the first game against me and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.390
 I want is obama. 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.580

 ninjas turtle games did not miss 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.200
 Streb had some games and all the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.690
 are part of the history of this 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 code or almost the entire game 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.849
 of the konami of something related to this 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.920
 code until metal gear had on metal 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.260
 gear 2 sounds of liberty 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.500
 if you run this snake code 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.560
 xingu you in substance also have and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.810
 finishing the metal gear solid 3 the game 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.730
 the legend of mystic or india has a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.829
 character that tells you to press the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 combination up down low want 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.940
 says the bea way 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.220
 nothing will happen one of the craziest in the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.220
 game fighting light international 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 superstar soccer looks like a bitch name 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.970
 in which if you make the code the judge will 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.280
 turns into a very good dog because 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650
 well is surprising is to continue the game 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 of konami and also games that are not 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.850
 of the konami that codes and codes only used in 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.040
 some sites that play games 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.010
 psycho like google reader 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.049
 if you run the code on your keyboard 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.060
 ninjas appear on the side and there 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.030
 some website that makes the joke and is very 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.049
 fun, it's cool, so it's a deal 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.639
 one searched 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.920
 if you want to know more games that use 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.920
 these site codes are worth
