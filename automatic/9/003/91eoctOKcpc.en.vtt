Celestia and then the end part is a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.730 
Celestia and then the end part is a
pseudo<00:02:04.710> episode<00:02:05.310> guide<00:02:05.930> for<00:02:06.930> season<00:02:07.469> four

Celestia<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.590> quick<00:02:24.190> flip<00:02:24.459> through<00:02:24.790> other

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
Celestia this quick flip through other

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.360 
Celestia this quick flip through other
stuff<00:02:25.989> about<00:02:26.170> star<00:02:26.440> swirl<00:02:26.739> there's<00:02:27.190> stuff

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
stuff about star swirl there's stuff

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.589 
stuff about star swirl there's stuff
about<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> castle<00:02:29.819> which<00:02:30.819> was<00:02:31.000> featured<00:02:31.180> in

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
about the castle which was featured in

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.699 
about the castle which was featured in
some<00:02:31.930> episodes

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
some episodes

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.539 
some episodes
some<00:02:33.610> people<00:02:33.879> say<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.390> enough<00:02:35.370> yeah<00:02:36.370> they're

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
some people say not enough yeah they're

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.339 
some people say not enough yeah they're
basically<00:02:36.849> divided<00:02:37.239> there's<00:02:37.390> Celestia<00:02:38.200> ones

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
basically divided there's Celestia ones

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.199

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
which have the gold lining and then Luna

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.930 
which have the gold lining and then Luna
ones<00:02:40.540> which<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.349> purple<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.819> know

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
ones which have the purple you know

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.380 
ones which have the purple you know
celeste<00:02:43.870> he<00:02:43.989> has<00:02:44.079> more<00:02:44.879> formal<00:02:45.879> handwriting

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
celeste he has more formal handwriting

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.000 
celeste he has more formal handwriting
and<00:02:46.510> guessing<00:02:46.660> than<00:02:46.870> Luna<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.739> first

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
and guessing than Luna and the first

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
and guessing than Luna and the first
entry<00:02:48.190> uses<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> royal<00:02:49.239> Canterlot<00:02:49.540> voice<00:02:49.840> but

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
entry uses the royal Canterlot voice but

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
entry uses the royal Canterlot voice but
then<00:02:50.410> she<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.680> kind<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:50.950> does<00:02:52.049> her<00:02:53.049> normal

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
then she just kind of does her normal

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.380 
then she just kind of does her normal
style<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.329> we<00:02:55.480> get<00:02:55.690> towards<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.200> end<00:02:56.379> of

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
style that we get towards the end of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.550 
style that we get towards the end of
Luna<00:02:58.390> eclipsed<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:01.989> Luna

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
Luna eclipsed so and then you know Luna

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.530 
Luna eclipsed so and then you know Luna
the<00:03:03.190> voices<00:03:03.519> are<00:03:03.640> very<00:03:03.670> distinct<00:03:04.420> because

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
the voices are very distinct because

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.979 
the voices are very distinct because
Celestia<00:03:05.140> sounds<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.340> more<00:03:06.989> composed

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
Celestia sounds you know more composed

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.380 
Celestia sounds you know more composed
in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.349> older<00:03:08.650> sister<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.099> then<00:03:09.220> Luna<00:03:09.430> Luna

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
in the older sister and then Luna Luna

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.819 
in the older sister and then Luna Luna
has<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:11.049> teenage<00:03:11.379> style<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:12.250> writing

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
has the more teenage style of writing

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.410 
has the more teenage style of writing
and<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:15.340> basically<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.879> whole<00:03:16.030> thing<00:03:16.299> is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and this basically the whole thing is

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
and this basically the whole thing is
about<00:03:16.629> them<00:03:16.810> getting<00:03:17.079> their<00:03:17.230> cutie<00:03:17.590> marks

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
about them getting their cutie marks

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.809 
about them getting their cutie marks
it<00:03:18.669> doesn't<00:03:18.970> quite<00:03:19.090> get<00:03:19.329> into<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.519> fall<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
it doesn't quite get into the fall of

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.659 
it doesn't quite get into the fall of
Nightmare<00:03:22.329> Moon<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:24.310> here's<00:03:24.609> the

Takes<00:03:39.790> Manhattan<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.269> noticed<00:03:43.599> in<00:03:43.720> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
Takes Manhattan but I noticed in the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.089 
Takes Manhattan but I noticed in the
first<00:03:44.049> portion<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.560> book<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.859> didn't

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
first portion of the book they didn't

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.920 
first portion of the book they didn't
use<00:03:45.250> nearly<00:03:45.579> as<00:03:45.790> many<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> vectors<00:03:46.690> we've

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
use nearly as many of the vectors we've

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.689 
use nearly as many of the vectors we've
seen<00:03:47.199> like<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.410> new<00:03:47.799> one<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.310> went<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.609> this

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
seen like that new one that went to this

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.990 
seen like that new one that went to this
white<00:03:48.879> light<00:03:49.109> like<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.379> vectors<00:03:50.829> from<00:03:51.099> we've

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
white light like the vectors from we've

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.150 
white light like the vectors from we've
seen<00:03:52.269> forever<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.500> first<00:03:53.739> one<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:53.949> more<00:03:54.099> like

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
seen forever the first one is more like

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.349 
seen forever the first one is more like
this<00:03:54.489> newer<00:03:55.829> new<00:03:56.829> drawings<00:03:57.400> or<00:03:57.879> star<00:03:58.120> swirl

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
this newer new drawings or star swirl

the bearded and yeah some of the old

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.819 
the bearded and yeah some of the old
vectors<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:01.959> they've<00:04:02.169> got<00:04:02.349> some<00:04:02.620> new<00:04:02.739> ones

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
vectors but they've got some new ones

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.430 
vectors but they've got some new ones
like<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:05.709> more<00:04:05.919> that<00:04:07.319> season<00:04:08.319> one
