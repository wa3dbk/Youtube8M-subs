alright<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.399> joke

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
alright this is a joke

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.420 
alright this is a joke
and<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.450> FM<00:02:02.810> radio<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.260> also<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.620> used<00:02:03.650> at

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and the FM radio can also be used at

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.510 
and the FM radio can also be used at
sleep<00:02:04.700> timer<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.420> set<00:02:05.960> has<00:02:06.170> an<00:02:06.290> alarm<00:02:06.520> haven't

sleep timer or set has an alarm haven't
got<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> puzzy<00:02:07.880> yet<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.020> update<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.560> time

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
got a puzzy yet we can update the time

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.860 
got a puzzy yet we can update the time
from<00:02:09.920> GPS<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:10.880> change<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> time<00:02:11.840> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
from GPS and so change the time to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.010 
from GPS and so change the time to
something<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.500> isn't<00:02:12.980> right<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:16.600> why<00:02:17.600> and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
something that isn't right for why and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.660 
something that isn't right for why and
you'll<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> time<00:02:18.740> has<00:02:18.950> been<00:02:19.130> updated<00:02:19.640> to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
you'll see the time has been updated to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.190 
you'll see the time has been updated to
141<00:02:20.660> p.m.<00:02:21.200> which<00:02:22.130> matches<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.670> time<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:24.080> be

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
141 p.m. which matches the time will be

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.400
