00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that comes out in the when it shoots out

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:56.990 
that comes out in the when it shoots out
of<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.369> triad

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.350 

so<00:00:57.690> we're<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> last<00:00:58.620> boss<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.280> this<00:01:00.180> one

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
so we're at the last boss and this one

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.700 
so we're at the last boss and this one
should<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> tunnel<00:01:02.880> rhino<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.500> didn't

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
should be the tunnel rhino so we didn't

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.770 
should be the tunnel rhino so we didn't
have<00:01:04.739> his<00:01:04.949> weapon<00:01:05.309> which<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> acid<00:01:06.330> blast

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
have his weapon which was the acid blast

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.350 
have his weapon which was the acid blast
but<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.820> use<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> same

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
but so you can use it or use the same

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
but so you can use it or use the same
tactic<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.710> much<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.070> lob<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.940> adding

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
tactic pretty much just lob at adding

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
tactic pretty much just lob at adding
and<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> same<00:01:13.530> tactic<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> trying<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and use the same tactic of trying to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.790 
and use the same tactic of trying to
dodge<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:15.450> sure<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.930> don't

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
dodge and make sure that you don't

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.350 
dodge and make sure that you don't
overcommit<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.910> sure<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.060> he<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
overcommit and make sure that he is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
overcommit and make sure that he is
actually<00:01:18.690> committed<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> hitting<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> wall

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
actually committed to hitting the wall

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:35.930 
actually committed to hitting the wall
before<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:20.280> jump<00:01:20.940> over<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
before you jump over them so with that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.859 
before you jump over them so with that
you<00:01:36.360> should<00:01:36.660> be<00:01:36.960> done<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.869> bosses

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you should be done with all the bosses

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.440 
you should be done with all the bosses
that<00:01:40.590> you've<00:01:40.770> already<00:01:40.979> defeated<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that you've already defeated so and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
that you've already defeated so and
hopefully<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.110> haven't<00:01:43.320> used<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.860> your

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
hopefully you haven't used any of your

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
hopefully you haven't used any of your
sub<00:01:44.160> tanks<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.789> no<00:01:44.910> big<00:01:45.060> deal<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.300> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
sub tanks but it's no big deal if you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.680 
sub tanks but it's no big deal if you
did<00:01:46.130> once<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:47.280> done<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.820> try<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.330> fill<00:01:48.509> up

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
did once you're done here try to fill up

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.810 
did once you're done here try to fill up
and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.800> right<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.550> will

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and then go to the right and there will

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.540 
and then go to the right and there will
be<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> door<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:52.470> through

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.650 

and<00:01:59.650> you'll<00:02:00.650> have<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.040> actually<00:02:01.280> take<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.910> the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
and you'll have to actually take on the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.290 
and you'll have to actually take on the
final<00:02:03.200> boss<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.860> stage<00:02:04.130> as<00:02:04.460> if<00:02:05.210> you

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
final boss of this stage as if you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.720 
final boss of this stage as if you
haven't<00:02:05.510> done<00:02:05.810> enough<00:02:05.900> fighting<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.730> that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
haven't done enough fighting and that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:28.990 
haven't done enough fighting and that
will<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:08.030> dr.<00:02:08.600> dopler<00:02:08.869> himself

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.390 

you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.030 

Oh

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
Oh

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:50.650 
Oh
Oh

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.960 

so<00:02:51.660> dr.<00:02:52.110> dopler<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.530> actually<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> pretty<00:02:53.700> easy

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
so dr. dopler is actually a pretty easy

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.660 
so dr. dopler is actually a pretty easy
guy<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:55.200> fight<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.010> drawn<00:02:56.370> out

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
guy the fight can be a little drawn out

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.700 
guy the fight can be a little drawn out
because<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.690> technique<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.170> he<00:02:58.470> uses

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
because of a technique that he uses

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.340 
because of a technique that he uses
which<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.390> hit<00:03:00.630> him<00:03:00.750> when<00:03:00.900> he<00:03:00.960> has<00:03:01.170> this

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
which if you hit him when he has this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.990 
which if you hit him when he has this
force<00:03:01.710> field<00:03:01.770> up<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:03.150> will<00:03:03.420> actually<00:03:03.660> heal<00:03:04.470> him

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
force field up it will actually heal him

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.450 
force field up it will actually heal him
so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.390> use<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> X<00:03:07.380> Buster<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.100> fact<00:03:08.280> i'm

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
so I use the X Buster and in fact i'm

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180 
so I use the X Buster and in fact i'm
using<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> X<00:03:08.940> Buster<00:03:09.270> upgrade<00:03:10.190> enhancement

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
using the X Buster upgrade enhancement

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.240 
using the X Buster upgrade enhancement
chip<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.780> shoot<00:03:12.780> full<00:03:13.290> fully<00:03:13.740> charged<00:03:13.980> shots

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
chip to shoot full fully charged shots

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.490 
chip to shoot full fully charged shots
at<00:03:14.430> him<00:03:14.460> here<00:03:14.730> initially<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:16.140> doesn't<00:03:16.410> really

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
at him here initially it doesn't really

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.360 
at him here initially it doesn't really
matter<00:03:18.860> basically<00:03:19.860> his<00:03:20.010> attacks<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.730> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
matter basically his attacks are to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.030 
matter basically his attacks are to
shoot<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.550> couple<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:24.410> orbs<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.710> which<00:03:25.890> you

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
shoot a couple of orbs at you which you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.300 
shoot a couple of orbs at you which you
can<00:03:26.220> easily<00:03:26.910> dodge<00:03:27.300> by<00:03:27.920> jumping<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> walls

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
can easily dodge by jumping on the walls

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.480 
can easily dodge by jumping on the walls
and<00:03:30.050> weaving<00:03:31.050> between<00:03:31.200> them<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.710> then<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
and weaving between them and then the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.970 
and weaving between them and then the
other<00:03:32.520> tack<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.480> sort<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.650> what

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
other tack is to sort of do like what

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.610 
other tack is to sort of do like what
bit<00:03:35.250> did<00:03:35.490> which<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.750> jump<00:03:36.750> up<00:03:36.960> in<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.110> air<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
bit did which is jump up in the air and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.680 
bit did which is jump up in the air and
depending<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.370> what<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.670> level<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.300> when

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
depending on what the level you are when

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.520 
depending on what the level you are when
he<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:41.010> come<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:41.760> eye-to-eye<00:03:42.450> with<00:03:42.510> him<00:03:42.840> he

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
he can come in I eye-to-eye with him he

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.320 
he can come in I eye-to-eye with him he
will<00:03:43.650> actually<00:03:44.010> shoot<00:03:44.190> across<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.670> screen<00:03:44.970> as

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
will actually shoot across the screen as

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.320 
will actually shoot across the screen as
ball<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.810> fire<00:03:45.990> which<00:03:46.920> again<00:03:47.400> pretty<00:03:48.030> simple

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
ball of fire which again pretty simple

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.660 
ball of fire which again pretty simple
to<00:03:48.450> avoid<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:49.110> meet<00:03:49.770> him<00:03:49.860> up<00:03:50.040> high<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.430> fall

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
to avoid just meet him up high and fall

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.220 
to avoid just meet him up high and fall
of<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> ground<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.420> he'll<00:03:51.690> fly<00:03:51.989> right<00:03:52.200> over

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
of the ground and he'll fly right over

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.479 
of the ground and he'll fly right over
you<00:03:54.530> other<00:03:55.530> than<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:56.070> make<00:03:56.250> sure<00:03:56.370> you

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
you other than that just make sure you

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.220 
you other than that just make sure you
don't<00:03:56.700> hit<00:03:56.910> him<00:03:57.120> right<00:03:57.330> there<00:03:57.600> when<00:03:57.870> he<00:03:58.050> has

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
don't hit him right there when he has

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.910 
don't hit him right there when he has
his<00:03:58.260> green<00:03:59.040> shield<00:03:59.340> up<00:04:02.959> now<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.020> think<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
his green shield up now I think that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.449 
his green shield up now I think that
what<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.880> found<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:09.170> he<00:04:10.170> tends<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.860> put<00:04:11.370> up

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
what I have found is he tends to put up

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.610 
what I have found is he tends to put up
that<00:04:11.610> shield<00:04:11.940> if<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.570> fire<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.260> quickly

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that shield if you fire really quickly

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.270 
that shield if you fire really quickly
when<00:04:13.830> he<00:04:13.950> comes<00:04:14.160> down<00:04:14.250> after<00:04:15.060> his<00:04:15.209> shot<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:17.040> if

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
when he comes down after his shot so if

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.010 
when he comes down after his shot so if
you<00:04:17.400> actually<00:04:17.549> hold<00:04:17.910> off<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> little<00:04:18.359> bit<00:04:18.570> it'll

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
you actually hold off a little bit it'll

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.960 
you actually hold off a little bit it'll
actually<00:04:19.230> be<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.530> little<00:04:19.680> easier<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.370> he

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
actually be a little easier and he

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.420 
actually be a little easier and he
always<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.330> same<00:04:21.690> pattern<00:04:22.080> it'll<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.220> orb

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
always the same pattern it'll be the orb

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.220 
always the same pattern it'll be the orb
shot<00:04:23.700> shield<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:26.330> fire<00:04:27.330> attack<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.020> then

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
shot shield a fire attack and then

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.559 
shot shield a fire attack and then
shield<00:04:28.800> again

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.629 

so<00:04:36.569> you<00:04:36.629> notice<00:04:36.870> I'm<00:04:36.990> holding<00:04:37.169> off<00:04:37.500> try<00:04:38.370> not<00:04:38.550> to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
so you notice I'm holding off try not to

00:04:38.639 --> 00:05:07.870 
so you notice I'm holding off try not to
hit<00:04:38.729> him<00:04:38.849> when<00:04:39.090> he<00:04:39.150> puts<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.479> shield<00:04:39.719> up

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.970 

if<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.540> move<00:05:08.660> quick<00:05:08.960> enough<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.440> should<00:05:09.710> be

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
if you move quick enough you should be

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.200 
if you move quick enough you should be
able<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.220> take<00:05:10.340> advantage<00:05:10.370> of<00:05:10.850> him<00:05:10.970> during

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
able to take advantage of him during

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.670 
able to take advantage of him during
that<00:05:11.360> fire<00:05:11.600> attack<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.110> hit<00:05:12.200> him<00:05:12.350> at<00:05:12.410> least<00:05:12.440> a

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
that fire attack and hit him at least a

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.440 
that fire attack and hit him at least a
couple<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:12.980> times<00:05:13.190> because<00:05:14.120> he's<00:05:14.240> not

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
couple of times because he's not

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:27.159 
couple of times because he's not
invincible

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.350 

yeah<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:28.099> for<00:05:28.639> some<00:05:28.759> reason<00:05:28.789> here<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.150> was

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
yeah and for some reason here I was

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.640 
yeah and for some reason here I was
trying<00:05:29.599> to<00:05:29.689> use<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:31.180> acid<00:05:32.180> blast<00:05:32.529> which<00:05:33.529> I

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
trying to use the acid blast which I

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.769 
trying to use the acid blast which I
think<00:05:33.919> works<00:05:34.189> pretty<00:05:34.520> well<00:05:34.639> against<00:05:35.150> him<00:05:35.300> yes

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
think works pretty well against him yes

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.040 
think works pretty well against him yes
it<00:05:35.990> does<00:05:36.169> but<00:05:37.009> it<00:05:37.849> is<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.180> little<00:05:38.389> slow<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:38.990> if

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
it does but it is a little slow and if

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.179 
it does but it is a little slow and if
you<00:05:39.110> don't<00:05:39.289> time<00:05:39.499> it<00:05:39.650> right<00:05:39.800> you'll<00:05:40.039> actually

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:40.189 
you don't time it right you'll actually

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.709 
you don't time it right you'll actually
hitting<00:05:40.520> when<00:05:40.669> he<00:05:40.729> puts<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:40.999> shield<00:05:41.300> up<00:05:41.479> and

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
hitting when he puts the shield up and

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.350 
hitting when he puts the shield up and
it<00:05:42.050> may<00:05:42.199> even<00:05:42.229> take<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.710> longer<00:05:42.979> so<00:05:43.400> if<00:05:43.669> you're

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
it may even take you longer so if you're

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.820 
it may even take you longer so if you're
going<00:05:44.509> to<00:05:44.599> use<00:05:44.749> it<00:05:44.960> make<00:05:45.110> sure<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.289> use<00:05:45.650> it

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
going to use it make sure you use it

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:54.309 
going to use it make sure you use it
carefully<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:53.360> with<00:05:53.509> that<00:05:53.629> you<00:05:53.900> should<00:05:54.229> have

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
carefully and with that you should have

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.409 
carefully and with that you should have
taken<00:05:54.469> care<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.740> dr.<00:05:55.099> dopler<00:05:55.279> and<00:05:55.669> then<00:05:56.150> you

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
taken care of dr. dopler and then you

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.860 
taken care of dr. dopler and then you
can<00:05:57.039> be<00:05:58.039> ready<00:05:58.219> for<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.460> final<00:05:58.759> stage<00:05:58.999> against

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
can be ready for the final stage against

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:17.210 
can be ready for the final stage against
you<00:06:00.680> know<00:06:00.830> who

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.870 

I

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:32.470 

ah

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480
