00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello people always at the start 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.280
 and today we come to our own 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.379
 house what I built from playmobil 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.050
 and of course you can do this house 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:20.680
 turn around with all the blocks or turn 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:23.950
 would the ahab i have a bar 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.240
 rebuilt his track and tiger jets like 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.610
 I built it to start 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.230
 we need this plate because that is 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 the skeleton of this house always start 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.950
 we have a piece right next to her 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:49.030
 a larger part 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:51.310
 The piece is now here nee 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 said best so that you know where 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.370
 these parts there was probably for data for what 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.270
 they are there 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.770
 the other eggstÃ¤tt without what everyone 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.629
 off is comes naturally can you then 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.520
 but also here to build back but me 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 it may still not so I just better 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.880
 can play with it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 Let's move on with the edge 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.020
 now pushed here now fixed 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.270
 the other after here and of course the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.820
 Golden middle 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:40.750
 but if there is a lot of stone here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:46.660
 Whatever happens there are also in the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.260
 other things you bought often 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.120
 yet this good will now be able to 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.860
 we fix it without it just starting 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:10.000
 shows that it is now so firmly 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:13.710
 We talk to the public 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.210
 not just in one direction 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.210
 you need this piece here 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:33.640
 this one here and that many here are the ones 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.040
 western city times from playmobil had 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.980
 have these things that is actually 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.450
 Pretty cool 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.700
 then we have this here I have it 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 we also need this from playmobil 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 now much here that it was sometimes 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.870
 what of playmobil but sometimes quite early 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.870
 that's pretty much the case with my brother 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.700
 Well, we can do that too hectic 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.400
 look here that this Ecktisch the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.770
 We can then have a Stammtisch for this 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.160
 was a bit too right here 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:17.290
 then we have the bartender here 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:29.650
 that actually happens 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:31.750
 bartender then put this is from 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.830
 this western city that one of the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.830
 drinking warns a lot already 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.760
 a farmer 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.410
 it is available with a tractor 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:49.920
 but usually it takes to come here 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:55.750
 there and our friend dj there is there too 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.150
 he also drinks a beer 23 and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 then comes that here 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.230
 it must take out short again 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:11.030

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.190

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.320

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.919
