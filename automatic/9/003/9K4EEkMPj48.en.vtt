 another video that will do today 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.420
 Because he is the white male today 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 will purify the steering box and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.219
 past the hour, right? 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.860
 have a club stay have to give maintenance 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 properly and change the oil of the cane 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.859
 that makes the walking stick only ask what looks 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.890
 cane but it is the oil that 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.350
 It was the tone of the front-winner world. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.290
 so I'll change the correct one is change the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.619
 every 10,000 km then rotated right 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 I'm going to change him and put it on. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.100
 blub greased the steering box 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 the direction box that is nothing more is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 This is where we are, where my finger is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.330
 seeing the spheres 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.670
 You have to pass a blue grease here. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 and down here it already works easy to do 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.880
 you do not have to dismantle the motorbike as 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 You can see and I do maintenance. 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 correctly and how you can see the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.799
 dismantled, it has to draw channels of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.750
 all for you to tinker in the steering box 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.369
 and in the oil cane again the supporter 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.079
 front right 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.259
 You still have to disassemble it here yet. 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.530
 also grease the steering box 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 No, and so, so, if somebody 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.860
 Ask your doctor how many ml each 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.849

 Lifting the bike is serious. 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.150
 this is the gas tank of the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.970

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.940
