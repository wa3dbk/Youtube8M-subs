on the trade fair why said well an
aircraft<00:00:30.460> on<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.900> plastic<00:00:31.900> show<00:00:32.080> is<00:00:32.260> quite

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
aircraft on a plastic show is quite

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.950 
aircraft on a plastic show is quite
unusual<00:00:32.830> but<00:00:33.309> in<00:00:33.489> fact<00:00:33.760> you<00:00:34.059> know<00:00:34.210> it's<00:00:34.690> just

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
unusual but in fact you know it's just

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.630 
unusual but in fact you know it's just
about<00:00:35.230> new<00:00:35.530> materials<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.280> advanced

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
about new materials and advanced

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.880 
about new materials and advanced
material<00:00:37.210> this<00:00:37.780> plane<00:00:38.020> in<00:00:38.230> fact<00:00:38.440> is<00:00:38.559> full<00:00:38.770> of

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
material this plane in fact is full of

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160 
material this plane in fact is full of
innovations<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.760> most<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.480> them<00:00:40.629> are<00:00:40.840> about

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
innovations and most of them are about

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.979 
innovations and most of them are about
plastics<00:00:41.769> in<00:00:42.070> which<00:00:42.970> new<00:00:43.180> materials<00:00:43.780> are<00:00:43.930> we

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
plastics in which new materials are we

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.750 
plastics in which new materials are we
talking<00:00:44.290> about<00:00:44.500> well<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.550> will<00:00:45.730> have

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
talking about well you will have

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.819 
talking about well you will have
materials<00:00:46.420> everywhere<00:00:47.050> in<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.380> new<00:00:47.590> plane

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
materials everywhere in this new plane

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.190 
materials everywhere in this new plane
you<00:00:47.980> know<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.280> aim<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.030> fly<00:00:49.329> day<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.140> night

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
you know the aim is to fly day and night

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.930 
you know the aim is to fly day and night
with<00:00:51.100> not<00:00:51.489> with<00:00:52.590> only<00:00:53.590> with<00:00:53.980> solar<00:00:54.190> energy<00:00:54.790> and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
with not with only with solar energy and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.020 
with not with only with solar energy and
so<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.780> have<00:00:55.899> to<00:00:56.079> build<00:00:56.290> a<00:00:56.410> light<00:00:56.590> plane<00:00:57.030> we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
so we have to build a light plane we

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.299 
so we have to build a light plane we
have<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.239> capture<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:59.050> solar<00:00:59.590> energy<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.070> we

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
have to capture the solar energy and we

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.400 
have to capture the solar energy and we
have<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.550> store<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.480> solar<00:01:01.690> energy<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.290> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
have to store the solar energy in the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.619 
have to store the solar energy in the
batteries<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.489> plastics<00:01:03.910> are<00:01:04.119> mainly<00:01:04.360> in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
batteries so the plastics are mainly in

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.440 
batteries so the plastics are mainly in
the<00:01:05.009> structure<00:01:06.009> for<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.580> light<00:01:06.759> weight<00:01:07.030> in

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
the structure for the light weight in

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.359 
the structure for the light weight in
the<00:01:09.330> solar<00:01:10.330> cells<00:01:10.660> encapsulation<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
the solar cells encapsulation in the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.480 
the solar cells encapsulation in the
batteries<00:01:12.820> for<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.149> storage<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:14.140> also<00:01:15.130> in

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
batteries for the storage and also in

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.240 
batteries for the storage and also in
films<00:01:16.060> for<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.750> installation<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
films for the installation of the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.090 
films for the installation of the
cockpit<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:19.600> which<00:01:19.990> new<00:01:20.200> materials<00:01:20.890> which

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
cockpit in which new materials which

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.210 
cockpit in which new materials which
plastics<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.789> you<00:01:21.910> use<00:01:22.090> mainly<00:01:23.220> polyurethane

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
plastics do you use mainly polyurethane

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.690 
plastics do you use mainly polyurethane
for<00:01:24.520> films<00:01:25.050> polyamides<00:01:26.050> polyamides<00:01:26.979> for<00:01:27.550> the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
the photovoltaic system today is the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.190 
the photovoltaic system today is the
first<00:01:36.759> day<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.240> trade<00:01:37.539> for<00:01:37.720> what<00:01:37.959> is<00:01:38.080> your

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
first day of the trade for what is your

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.309 
first day of the trade for what is your
overall<00:01:38.229> impression<00:01:39.099> well<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.330> good<00:01:40.899> good

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
overall impression well it's a good good

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.480 
overall impression well it's a good good
start<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.979> think<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.840> me<00:01:44.160> what<00:01:45.160> we<00:01:45.310> see

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
start I think and for me what we see

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.760 
start I think and for me what we see
here<00:01:45.759> in<00:01:46.030> terms<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.360> materials<00:01:47.080> really

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
here in terms of materials really

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.940 
here in terms of materials really
answers<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:49.030> questions<00:01:49.780> we<00:01:50.110> are<00:01:50.200> facing<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.860> a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
answers the questions we are facing in a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.800 
answers the questions we are facing in a
world<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.940> are<00:01:52.060> really<00:01:52.300> following<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
world we are really following the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.169 
world we are really following the
megatrends<00:01:53.259> about<00:01:53.979> energy<00:01:54.340> about<00:01:54.849> water

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
megatrends about energy about water

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.620 
megatrends about energy about water
about<00:01:56.050> yeah<00:01:56.739> renewable<00:01:57.550> energies<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.239> energy

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
about yeah renewable energies and energy

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.930 
about yeah renewable energies and energy
storage<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.560> we<00:01:59.830> are<00:01:59.920> really<00:02:00.160> preparing<00:02:00.700> the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
storage so we are really preparing the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.330 
storage so we are really preparing the
future<00:02:01.300> with<00:02:01.929> our<00:02:01.959> plastics<00:02:02.679> for<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.009> future

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340
