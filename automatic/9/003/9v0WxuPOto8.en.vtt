 professional way artists like that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.190
 go 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.629
 that's true when we know when we 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 had a hidden talent in the family of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.680
 sylvie joly had to practice in secret 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 here is an amateur amateur is he your 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.629
 great uncle back him for example and at 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.700
 French comedy 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 the father is good by no but without 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 to laugh that is to say that it was the freight 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.079
 we are a grandmother who was at the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.520
 French comedy with a pseudonym and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.480
 they were five children and when we 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 ask my great grandmother as 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.079
 there was you had 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 this child she said 4 in the photos 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 of family there is an ink stain at the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 place of this tome law has changed anyway 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.299
 Morgane looked like she d 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 ixelles December his parents with his 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.520

 Greek to do x but my kids this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 by a problem it has changed anyway 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.619
 because at the time of 6.10 to comedy 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.940
 French it was frowned upon sub one is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.200
 glad if the effect of the xv has too much you 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.970
 then say something a little bit anyway 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.679
 little inflated anyway you say it is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.640
 more difficult to impose when we 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.860
 comes from an affluent background 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 yes I think it's me I'm 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 okay and that 's the cvo yes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 viviane hamy the aristos and I 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 can not cry on the child 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 of a wealthy family even when it is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 annoyed that's exactly what is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 it's hard not to cry about these 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.509
 specifies the one that turns local to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 school the kid of rich me I would have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.780
 never wanted to be because of streets up 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.520
 the kid of rich to him says wait for you 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 will not complain anyway huh 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 parents he seems a winner and where 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.679
 often he has everything but love 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.030
 he has nice bag and lab bag leather he has 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.319
 nice pens but he has no love 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.410
 and this one must the unfortunate 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.500
 that only two children make good 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.800
 who does not have love obviously and who 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800
 is sick 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.440
 so early comic rental 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.370
 you say I was born clown and like 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.110
 you are a believer 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.610
 you considered very early your 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.190
 vocation it was a two or even a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.390
 some way to exploit your talent 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.160
 Comic is a kind of will 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.990
 mystical to do good to people yes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.970
 it's true at one point I got 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.710
 said well yes it's true that on this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 last we have the impression that we are talented 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.070
 for something and that was said 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.640
 no harm to people laugh well yes 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.350
 exactly 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 then as a child you were sent from 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.410
 this religious institution and you 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.040
 are found in the class of 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.239

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.989
 she good student 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.380
 yeah that was easy this meaning by 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.360
 compared to gold after baccalaureate your parents 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.440
 prohibit you from becoming an actress and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 your father tells you since you want 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.160

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.920
 from you it's horny mastery you 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.870

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.310
 firecrackers mark but everyone has 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.840
 right to a lawyer but he had when 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.950
 even ideas to its shareholders 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.810

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.390
 fascinated by the man he has but that he 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.120
 had defended yeah then realized that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.530
 Beyond the effects of the round 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.910
 it's like tons of paperwork in 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.260
 this lawyer job and then the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.549
 responsibility since you say if I
