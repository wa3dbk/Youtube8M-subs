one<00:02:29.550> since<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.240> stopped<00:02:30.420> Pearl<00:02:30.630> Harbor<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.430> in

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
one since I stopped Pearl Harbor was in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.130 
one since I stopped Pearl Harbor was in
1920s<00:02:33.150> right<00:02:33.270> after<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:33.570> made<00:02:33.690> my<00:02:33.870> loyalty<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
1920s right after they made my loyalty I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.250 
1920s right after they made my loyalty I
got<00:02:34.380> they<00:02:34.620> bombed<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:36.360> bombed<00:02:36.750> Pearl<00:02:37.170> Harbor

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
got they bombed the bombed Pearl Harbor

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.880 
got they bombed the bombed Pearl Harbor
Missouri<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> testing<00:02:39.060> site<00:02:39.300> too<00:02:39.890> because

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
Missouri as a testing site too because

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.990 
Missouri as a testing site too because
basically<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.280> think<00:02:41.490> what<00:02:41.610> they<00:02:41.700> were<00:02:41.790> trying

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
basically I think what they were trying

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.670 
basically I think what they were trying
to<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.720> see<00:02:42.870> how<00:02:43.020> Pearl<00:02:43.320> Harbor

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to do then is to see how Pearl Harbor

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.010 
to do then is to see how Pearl Harbor
would<00:02:43.830> react<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.580> future<00:02:45.000> when<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.900> gets

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
would react in the future when it gets

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.520
