00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 About this time, four control negative enemy Send us a bit easier to know 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 So it will bleach. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.869
 Once you do not think this is something difficult, 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 Pray that I will explain each picture one by one. 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'll do it. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.649
 The pitch of the benefits is one of those 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:42.620
 Basically give it to me completely. 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.620
 Jung-gu A Da 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 Thank you. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 So, 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.400
 1 unique 4 degrees and 5 degrees, and the next chapter about the party and the disabled 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.400
 Likewise 2 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.910
 3 down 6 7 degrees 5 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.010
 2 7 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 Differences among the different US-wave and upon degree 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.730
 He does want he wants is different and unique're kid is also includes customers 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.500
 It looks like you did. 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.760
 Do not include any common sense, and in terms sha wujing hangeo surface activity two 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.900
 wish 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.700
 So here now to explore one of the US waves and stones, and when that's that want 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.440
 There may seem a bit difficult to say that once again I will be true 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.580
 I'll go over it once. 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.720
 Oh, I become like this. 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:01.840
 Boardwalk is coming Can I just wrote, as you understand it literally 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.910
 It's short, long, full, and so you can understand. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.479
 The pitch is that I am now the first person to say that the sound should be 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 I told you that the parts that are well behind the room are the same. 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.700
 In the end, there is an opportunity for sound and sound. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.510
 Socialism and then in a full expedition if 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 If you think a bit of luck is getting longer, you'll be able to do it again intelligently. 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 And you 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.370
 He's been in a little bit of each other for nine minutes now. 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.540
 He can not get over this perfectly. Basically, 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.130
 You can not move out into the river instead of n Jews as financial or something 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.570
 So if you know there are others like me, the answer to just two three-Cologne 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.480
 It would be wrong, but if your opponent is in a single phase, this would be a little shorter 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.800
 Adultery is also grateful. 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.560
 The ever major third floor is wall a little longer acidity ranging Saints 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.810
 However, if Jangsam is short in the third chapter, 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.350
 Also , 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.070
 It will be like this . 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.120
 Once you realize that this is an idea 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.120
 It is good to memorize 2 o'clock
