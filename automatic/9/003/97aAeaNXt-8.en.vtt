00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and I'll probably use a little bit of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.710 
and I'll probably use a little bit of
spray<00:01:36.570> butter<00:01:36.810> maybe<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> vegetables<00:01:38.720> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
spray butter maybe on the vegetables so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.420

anyway<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.950> entire<00:01:41.700> plate<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.020> five<00:01:43.770> points

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
anyway this entire plate is five points

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.969 
anyway this entire plate is five points
so<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.509> protein<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.799> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so you have your protein you have your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
so you have your protein you have your
little<00:01:47.159> starch<00:01:47.610> which<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> low<00:01:49.259> on

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
little starch which by the way is low on

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.649 
little starch which by the way is low on
the<00:01:49.770> glycemic<00:01:49.799> index<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.020> fabulous<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
the glycemic index so it's fabulous and

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
the glycemic index so it's fabulous and
then<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.140> broccoli<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> course<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> free

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
then the broccoli of course is a free

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.840 
then the broccoli of course is a free
food<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> carrots<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
food and so is the carrots and the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.109 
food and so is the carrots and the
quinoa<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:01.259> fabulous<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> said
