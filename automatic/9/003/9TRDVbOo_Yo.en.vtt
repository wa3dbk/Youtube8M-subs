embroidery machine I bought it
secondhand<00:00:19.930> 30<00:00:20.380> years<00:00:20.710> ago<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:23.050> it's<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.949> very

secondhand 30 years ago but it's a very
very<00:00:24.520> simple<00:00:24.789> machine<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:26.199> does<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:27.730> similar

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
very simple machine it does very similar

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.689 
very simple machine it does very similar
things<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.840> multi<00:00:29.260> head<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.890> industrial

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
things to a multi head to the industrial

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.670 
things to a multi head to the industrial
machines<00:00:31.269> computer<00:00:31.869> machines<00:00:32.199> that<00:00:32.439> you<00:00:32.500> use

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
machines computer machines that you use

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.060 
machines computer machines that you use
now<00:00:32.920> but<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:33.790> totally<00:00:34.000> hung<00:00:34.360> governed<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
now but it's totally hung governed so

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.490 
now but it's totally hung governed so
what<00:00:36.910> you<00:00:37.059> have<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.800> machine<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:40.500> no

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
what you have is that the machine has no

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.190 
what you have is that the machine has no
feed<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:42.610> will<00:00:42.940> feed<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.450> fabric<00:00:43.930> through

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
feed that will feed the fabric through

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.830 
feed that will feed the fabric through
all<00:00:44.410> right<00:00:44.649> and<00:00:44.890> no<00:00:45.130> presser<00:00:45.700> foot<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.780> you

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
all right and no presser foot so you

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.619 
all right and no presser foot so you
just<00:00:47.170> got<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.469> free<00:00:47.770> needle<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.270> what

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
just got the free needle and is it what

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.729 
just got the free needle and is it what
I'm<00:00:49.750> not<00:00:49.899> going<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.079> say<00:00:50.170> it's<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> regular

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
I'm not going to say it's a regular

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.229 
I'm not going to say it's a regular
there's<00:00:51.040> not<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.219> spring<00:00:51.520> needle<00:00:51.820> raining<00:00:52.120> but

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
there's not a spring needle raining but

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.619 
there's not a spring needle raining but
this<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:52.510> just<00:00:52.719> just<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.140> plain<00:00:54.129> needle<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.360> if

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
this is just just a plain needle so if

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.080 
this is just just a plain needle so if
you<00:00:55.809> just<00:00:56.020> just<00:00:56.890> as<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.070> straight<00:00:57.430> tube<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:57.969> of

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
you just just as a straight tube but of

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.619 
you just just as a straight tube but of
course<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.719> costs<00:00:58.960> you're<00:00:59.260> free<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.800> can<00:01:00.039> do

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
course it costs you're free you can do

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.299 
course it costs you're free you can do
your<00:01:01.629> moving<00:01:01.930> your<00:01:02.050> paper<00:01:02.289> rather<00:01:02.649> than<00:01:02.829> your

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
your moving your paper rather than your

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.149 
your moving your paper rather than your
yes<00:01:03.670> pencil<00:01:04.590> but<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.709> wonder<00:01:05.920> what<00:01:06.039> this

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
yes pencil but the wonder what this

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.149 
yes pencil but the wonder what this
machine<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.639> that<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.969> have<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.149> knee<00:01:07.359> table

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
machine is that I have a knee table

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.459 
machine is that I have a knee table
which<00:01:09.159> I<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.520> press<00:01:09.759> and

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:28.340 

and<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.829> does<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.070> width

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 

so<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.330> industrial

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so and because it's an industrial

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.090 
so and because it's an industrial
machine<00:01:31.080> it's<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.650> tough<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.640> yeah

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.730 

and<00:01:40.370> presumably<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.570> can<00:01:41.750> use<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.229> really<00:01:42.710> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and presumably you can use a really a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.460 
and presumably you can use a really a
wide<00:01:43.070> variety<00:01:43.400> of<00:01:43.909> threads<00:01:44.540> on<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:44.930> too

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
wide variety of threads on this too

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.040 
wide variety of threads on this too
and<00:01:45.800> yes<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.460> quite<00:01:46.580> sensitive<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.540> mean<00:01:47.960> you

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
and yes it's quite sensitive I mean you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.260 
and yes it's quite sensitive I mean you
can<00:01:48.229> use<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.520> rayon<00:01:49.760> thread<00:01:50.120> you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
can use this is just a rayon thread you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.510 
can use this is just a rayon thread you
can<00:01:50.300> move<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.630> cotton<00:01:51.020> all<00:01:51.200> around<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.250> you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
can move the cotton all around but you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.870 
can move the cotton all around but you
can<00:01:52.700> also<00:01:52.850> put<00:01:54.070> thick<00:01:55.070> threads<00:01:55.340> in<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.610> spool

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
can also put thick threads in the spool

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.859 
can also put thick threads in the spool
you<00:01:56.810> know<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.880> change<00:01:58.880> your<00:01:59.150> tension

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
you know and change your tension

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.719 
you know and change your tension
well<00:02:00.350> yes<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.710> refer<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.520> one<00:02:01.700> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
well yes you refer to that on one of

your lovely nice things how you change

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.050 
your lovely nice things how you change
the<00:02:03.410> tension<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.160> bottom<00:02:04.460> thread<00:02:04.670> comes<00:02:04.940> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
the tension so the bottom thread comes a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.850 
the tension so the bottom thread comes a
little<00:02:05.180> bit<00:02:05.330> up<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.869> top<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.380> yes<00:02:06.590> you're

little bit up to the top so yes you're
quite<00:02:07.040> happy<00:02:07.460> changing<00:02:07.970> tension<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.479> know<00:02:08.539> my

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
quite happy changing tension I know my

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.630 
quite happy changing tension I know my
students<00:02:09.440> kind<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.740> go<00:02:09.860> all<00:02:10.070> mustn't<00:02:10.550> touch

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
students kind of go all mustn't touch
