00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.549 
the vestibular retromolar region
exposing<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.610> mandible<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.240> plan<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.229> first

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
exposing the mandible the plan is first

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.210 
exposing the mandible the plan is first
to<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.070> small<00:01:05.489> marking<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> cut<00:01:07.409> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to make a small marking and cut then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
to make a small marking and cut then
later<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.729> fix<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> destructor<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.650> either

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
later on fix the destructor on either

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.100 
later on fix the destructor on either
side

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
side

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.490 
side
and<00:01:12.200> used<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.920> osteotome<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.760> break<00:01:14.060> thee<00:01:14.500> one

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
and used to osteotome to break thee one

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.710 
and used to osteotome to break thee one
of<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.740> cortex<00:01:16.190> that<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.700> plant<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.690> you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
of the cortex that is the plant so you

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.380 
of the cortex that is the plant so you
can<00:01:17.930> see<00:01:18.140> me<00:01:18.320> exposing<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.240> mandible<00:01:20.240> on

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
can see me exposing the mandible on

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.900 
can see me exposing the mandible on
either<00:01:20.780> side<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.980> we<00:01:22.310> need<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.610> make<00:01:22.790> the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
either side because we need to make the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.960 
either side because we need to make the
bone<00:01:23.150> cuts<00:01:23.420> through<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.900> mouth<00:01:24.620> only<00:01:25.310> fixing

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
bone cuts through the mouth only fixing

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.380 
bone cuts through the mouth only fixing
the<00:01:26.410> external<00:01:27.580> distractor<00:01:28.580> pins<00:01:28.880> through<00:01:29.270> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
the external distractor pins through the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.010 
the external distractor pins through the
outside

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
outside

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840

so<00:01:31.409> once<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> mandible<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.369> completely

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so once the mandible is completely

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.460 
so once the mandible is completely
exposed<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> child<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> mix<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
exposed the child is in the mix the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
exposed the child is in the mix the
initial<00:01:34.799> period<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.430> need<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.939> careful

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
initial period so you need to be careful

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.160 
initial period so you need to be careful
where<00:01:37.049> we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.420 
pinned it is fixed on the ramus
-<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.490> need<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:57.000> pins<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.799> depth<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
- you need two pins so the depth of the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.720 
- you need two pins so the depth of the
pin<00:01:59.969> may<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.210> ten<00:02:00.509> millimeter<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.009> ball

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.880 

you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.390> see<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.660> calibrations<00:02:06.320> on<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.650> pins

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
you can see the calibrations on the pins

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.449 
you can see the calibrations on the pins
as<00:02:07.220> well<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.580> on<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.850> screwdriver

as well as on the screwdriver

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.330 
as well as on the screwdriver
now<00:02:09.940> plan<00:02:10.599> for<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.020> exactly<00:02:11.880> plan<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.120> fix

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
now plan for the exactly plan to fix

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.210 
now plan for the exactly plan to fix
so<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> distractor<00:02:15.989> when<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.860> make

now on either side breaking the you know

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.710 
now on either side breaking the you know
the<00:03:30.010> destructor<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.130> fixed<00:03:31.520> on<00:03:31.849> one<00:03:31.910> side<00:03:32.480> and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.250 

actually<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.120> quite<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.540> cumbersome<00:03:42.930> for

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
actually this is quite so cumbersome for

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.890 
actually this is quite so cumbersome for
the<00:03:43.379> child<00:03:43.849> because<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.120> consolidation

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
the child because the consolidation

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.780

yeah<00:03:50.970> now<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.690> distractors<00:03:52.260> are<00:03:52.440> fixed<00:03:52.830> you

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
yeah now the distractors are fixed you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.790 
yeah now the distractors are fixed you
can<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.430> me<00:03:53.580> closing<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:55.200> latent<00:03:55.650> period

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
can see me closing it the latent period

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.040 
can see me closing it the latent period

point five millimeter dissection so on
both<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.890> ends<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:08.340> need<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.640> give<00:04:08.849> one<00:04:09.060> full

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
both the ends you need to give one full

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.460 
both the ends you need to give one full
turn<00:04:09.540> above<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.890> inferior

turn above and the inferior

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.130 
turn above and the inferior
as<00:04:13.040> we<00:04:13.400> distracted<00:04:14.060> clinically<00:04:14.600> you<00:04:14.690> can<00:04:14.840> see

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
as we distracted clinically you can see

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.280 
as we distracted clinically you can see
their<00:04:15.579> jaw<00:04:16.579> moving<00:04:16.959> accordingly<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.260> can

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
their jaw moving accordingly you can

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.060 
their jaw moving accordingly you can
adjust<00:04:18.860> the<00:04:19.010> middle<00:04:19.400> screw<00:04:19.670> so<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
adjust the middle screw so that the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.860 
adjust the middle screw so that the
lower<00:04:22.070> part<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.640> distractors<00:04:23.270> moves

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
lower part of the distractors moves

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.340 
lower part of the distractors moves
upwards<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:25.510> anteriorly<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.630> upwards<00:04:27.170> so

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
upwards and anteriorly and upwards so

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.260 
upwards and anteriorly and upwards so
that<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.680> open<00:04:28.010> by<00:04:28.130> it's<00:04:28.250> completely<00:04:28.790> closes

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
that the open by it's completely closes

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.050 
that the open by it's completely closes
so<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.620> advantage<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.610> multi

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
so this is the advantage of this multi

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.790 
so this is the advantage of this multi
vector

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.140 

so<00:04:37.930> once<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.409> dissection<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:39.009> completed<00:04:39.610> once

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
so once the dissection is completed once

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.140 
so once the dissection is completed once
the<00:04:40.419> lower<00:04:40.629> jaw<00:04:40.870> moves<00:04:41.139> up<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.580> tongue<00:04:42.819> tongue

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
the lower jaw moves up the tongue tongue

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.689 
the lower jaw moves up the tongue tongue
also<00:04:43.360> doesn't<00:04:43.840> fall<00:04:44.020> out<00:04:44.220> these<00:04:45.220> are<00:04:45.400> small

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
also doesn't fall out these are small

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.159 
also doesn't fall out these are small
