00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 stopped working in one part and good 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.810
 because there they see nothing more than a small 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.489
 cut what happened but good what 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.080

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.030
 comes being usual there was only 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.590
 how he made his triple death but good in 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.300
 this scene looks a little more in detail 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.380

 9 with a water folk by cristian 564 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.360
 where more than anything is a water attack 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.030
 and as you can see it is jumping and good 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 he teleported threw grenade thinking 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.620
 that he was going to fall far away from an enemy but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.270
 good ended up hitting the wall and 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.820
 well bounced the grenade right to your 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.800
 leg and got an epic suicide the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.550
 true a severe attack from the one that 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.590

 we see that he makes a double death of form 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.340
 snapshot we see that it does a little bit to 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.440
 back so that the pomegranates do not fall 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.270

 double death apart with hard 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.520
 snapshots with the card and we see how 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.110
 is waiting here and in all 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.330

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.140

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.830
 kill your enemies with the suppressor 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.990
 but good at the end makes a ninja 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.580
 improve one and it was stolen for the other 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.560
 getting assistance and good here 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.360
 start the watford where you are 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 that is the symbol of the sniper but in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.200
 if the weapon is not there and then it will take 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.209
 7 seconds when it reappears and good and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 Bishop takes the sniper a small wadding 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.190
 they get thrown with the nike for a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.830
 bullet there we see that he got to do 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.900
 management it seems that it was bouncing 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.970
 but in itself there was only a small 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.830
 delay here we see how the enemy came out 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 after time a little delay 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.760
 an enemy behind activates his backpack 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.680

 was going to hit his super lightning pistol 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.590
 pro and for this last type a second 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.090
 matrix is ​​excellent to win the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.310
 heading to free for all there we see that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.780
 it is in the first place and there it gets 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.780

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.530
 matrix curiously they did not tell the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 I really do not know why but good at the end 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.610

 cannon to the guy who was already going to kill him 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.290
 he left watson then makes a matrix 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.570
 to the moral type that comes up 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.370

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.180
 probos supplies grabs the sniper and 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.670
 Well, at the end a few 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.740
 shots to the body to this guy who came to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.150

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.260
 at number 4 a streak with a bit of 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.909
 luck of king master x of we see that 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.250
 begins killing the guy who is 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.810
 put right in front we see that it's 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.549
 trying to shoot with life at 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.049
 enemies there are ones that kills one and there 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.509

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.109
 there was a severe attack by laxe put the 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.000
 black screen and good then in the end 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.530
 this time ended up falling and now yes 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.180
 the super pro streak begins again 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.610
 start making it date of this type 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.410
 that was there on the floor an ex mate 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.240

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.650
 good exercise for pure donot q 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.930
 the guy who was on the right super 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.759
 pro and we start with the new category 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.320
 that came from the previous and good tuff 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.320
 because this time we started with chin 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.060
 esparta 95 where he gets his revenge 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.880
 from the previous shot we see how he did the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.560
 matrix to king master x from there we see how 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.780
 nor did he realize when I activated the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.370
 backpack propelled it managed to kill and in 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.169
 this time we have a claire mini 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.509
 where he makes a matrix with a backpack 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.160
 propeller to nothing more and nothing less than to 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.750
 squadron series we see how it was 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.599
 going up he did not realize what 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.449
 it happened and we ended up with dart where 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.669
 makes a matrix but murder and there 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.370
 we see that he applied it to enough dad 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.860
 we will see how to do 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.110
 murders in the new category of it 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.110
 apply to him and there they are all super pro 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.130
 and good also taking advantage of the 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.810
 number three arrivals with a super 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.520
 killing the truth these last three 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.440
 I liked clips very much 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.479
 they were the best that arrived and good 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.220
 this time he grabs his app we see that 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.110
 was killing the enemies equal and in 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.030
 a free for value I do not know if it is a requirement 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.919
 without the requirement as they will give you their 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.169
 magnanimous and as you can see it gets 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.030
 continue giving his streak I have wanted 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.220
 a rating you get in your 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.020
 deadly takes the road away from a 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.310
 enemy that are up there there 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.840
 we see that it takes six and good here to 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.060
 side was found another guy pull another 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.010
 once your app takes seven and gets to do 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.530
 an excellent rat catcher here makes his 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.330
 catastrophe of fury and well then nothing 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.800
 more was found the guy who was by 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
 here but he could not make his 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.580
 following streaks but good at the end 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.229
 they found killer frenzy and there it is 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.229
 in the magnanimous in number 3 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.379
 in number 2 we have w and lx we see 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.090
 that is with the electromagnetic gun 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.069

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.960
 fly flies here we see how 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.879
 making ships and well in the distance 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.860
 manages to shoot him in an excellent way 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.659
 this guy getting triple death 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.490
 What I like most about this clip is how 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.500
 the enemies do not stop coming out in that 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.020
 team of 4 against 4 and there you get in 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.550
 its mori but here you have a streak of 6 with 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.289
 this guy that brought the rocket launcher 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.000
 was about to kill him and good to 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.099
 end get a rat poison 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.440
 excellent this guy who was going down the ramp 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:42.310
 and nothing else is there in number 2 with 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.130
 its electromagnetic cannon streak 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.620
 and in number 1 we have nothing more and 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.450
 nothing less than headmaster 21 is going to 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.250
 be a super sniper streak here we see 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.110
 that starts killing a guy does double 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.110
 in the distance the enemies are the 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.520
