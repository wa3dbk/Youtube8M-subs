filled with water to the fill line but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.470 
filled with water to the fill line but
first<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.070> look

Michelle to ground kontrol we found the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:29.770 
Michelle to ground kontrol we found the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.060 

now<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.840> replace<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
now we replace to move up into the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
now we replace to move up into the
chamber<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.030> water<00:01:33.240> no<00:01:33.659> Michelle<00:01:33.960> we

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
chamber with the water no Michelle we

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
chamber with the water no Michelle we
don't<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> sink<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.770> outer<00:01:34.920> space<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
don't have a sink in outer space so I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.310 
don't have a sink in outer space so I
suppose<00:01:36.540> we'll<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
suppose we'll have to use that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.690 
suppose we'll have to use that
