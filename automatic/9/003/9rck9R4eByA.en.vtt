 hello youtube eros I am arpeggios I decided to participate in the contest of the 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.439
 antic trail 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.269
 a few days ago I went to see the abandoned movie with my girlfriend Argentina 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.919
 The secret of his eyes directed by Juan Jose Campanella and starring 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.919
 ricardo darín solitude villamil and guillermo francella 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.989
 I loved it 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.769
 I estimated high level 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.910
 an excellent script some colossal actors a story that has 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.600
 very much interest 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 the movie buff appreciates tapes of this quality 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.950
 just over two hours living and enjoying suffering from a story 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 typically Buenos Aires with an exceptional interpretation 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.070
 Benjamín Chaparro has just retired after working a whole life as 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.090
 employee in a criminal court 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.960
 to occupy his free time he decides to write a novel based on a 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.100
 real story of which he has been a witness and protagonist 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.820
 the novel that he writes is apparently the story of a murder happened 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.420
 Buenos Aires in 1974 and the investigation to find the culprit 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.220
 but once opened the door of that past to the own short one will become 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 impossible to close 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.840
 first because the turbulent Argentina of that time sneaks into the lives of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.990
 characters with their burden of violence and death 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 And above all because, even though it's short, I suppose that the story he weaves speaks 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.400
 only from the past does his search illuminate his own 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.810
 life and its present and puts him face to face with a love dilemma that obsesses him 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.220
 for too long 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.560
 rebuilding the past will lead you to dive into your own feelings your 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 own behaviors and decisions 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.180
 and finding the truth will end up becoming not a literary goal 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.020
 if not 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 in the key that allows you to open the door to live the rest of your life 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.980
 chosen to represent argentina in this year's oscar the kung movie 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.570
 great success at the last festival of san sebastián being one of the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.460
 favorite for the golden shell that the film ultimately took 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.550
 anti-war Chinese 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.870
 the secret of his eyes is a movie that one should not miss 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.749
 the secret of his eyes is a great movie 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.599
 it's not a good genre movie 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.519
 it's not an effective job 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.149
 it's a great movie 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:22.549
 all performances including the minute characters of two seconds or 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.029
 even pablo rago are good 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.909
 the direction of actors was always one of the qualities of campanella but 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.409
 this time he achieved something almost miraculous 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.510
 everything from the excellent art 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.340
 at the height of the fifth day of music dialogues photography 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 imposes a rhythm that catches from 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.519
 the watchmaking script has something of the excellent nine queens of and the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.299
 institute although without its mechanical component 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.099
 it's a perfectly well-told story set in buenos aires 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.760
 and developed over two decades including the years of lead 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.849
 but that miraculously does not try to educate us does not explain to us that 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.699
 Argentines we are like that because the fuck life that the task of each reader is 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:08.109
 denouncing injustice is a movie of a movie lover who discovers the 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.849
 prestige I had 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.769
 that teaches us movies 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.159
 among many other things that you have to be brave about love because the 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.479
 life can happen to you in the 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.949
 academic but well resolved always exciting in its development and with a 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.539
 technical finish that you would want to see more often in our cinema the 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.989
 secret of their eyes is one of those movies that return prizes are 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.129
 look from where you look 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.089
 I hope you liked my review, take care
