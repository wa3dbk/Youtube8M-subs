historically starts to seasonal pattern
off<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> big<00:00:21.660> part<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
off but I think the big part is that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.410 
off but I think the big part is that
look<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.529> Germany<00:00:23.010> last<00:00:23.160> week<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.970> german

return<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.559> impressed<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.579> fact<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> gold<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

real<00:00:43.230> rates<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> return<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> US<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
real rates of return are in the US so

think it I think a lot of it is sort of
China<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> economic

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
China I think that the economic

China I think that the economic
prosperity<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.730> conundrum

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
prosperity now we're in a conundrum

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750 
prosperity now we're in a conundrum
you'd<00:00:54.449> call<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.800> PM<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.340> which

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you'd call it because the PM is which

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.869 
you'd call it because the PM is which
drive<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> demand<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:58.079> iron<00:00:58.469> ore<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.550> coal

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
drive the demand for iron ore for coal

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
drive the demand for iron ore for coal
and<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.480> steel<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.250> all

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and for steel and for all it that's all

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.369 
and for steel and for all it that's all
slowing<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> PMI

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
slowing down because you see the PMI

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
slowing down because you see the PMI
sort<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> China's<00:01:05.129> slowing<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sort of China's slowing down but the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
sort of China's slowing down but the
stock<00:01:06.540> market's<00:01:07.049> been<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> tear<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
stock market's been on a tear and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
stock market's been on a tear and
they're<00:01:08.729> doing<00:01:08.909> everything<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.720> create

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it a grease the big risk there and

Danielle is is the is the collateral

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
Danielle is is the is the collateral
borrowings<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.770> from<00:01:56.070> French

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
borrowings that they have from French

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
borrowings that they have from French
and<00:01:56.700> German<00:01:57.210> banks<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.530> something<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and German banks so it's something that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
and German banks so it's something that
they<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.790> default<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.229> have

they if they default it's going to have

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.600 
they if they default it's going to have
a<00:02:01.380> bigger<00:02:01.619> impact<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.030> banks<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:04.610> France

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
a bigger impact on the banks in France

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.419 
a bigger impact on the banks in France
and<00:02:05.759> Germany<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.420> Belgium<00:02:06.570> etc<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.250> will

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and Germany and Belgium etc so that will

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.089 
and Germany and Belgium etc so that will
be<00:02:08.550> short-term<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.509> euro<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:09.959> fall<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.470> 85

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
be short-term the euro will fall to 85

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.080 
be short-term the euro will fall to 85
there'll<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> crisis<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
there'll be a crisis with it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
there'll be a crisis with it
we'll<00:02:13.360> hit<00:02:13.599> all-time<00:02:13.870> highs<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:14.620> euro<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
we'll hit all-time highs the euro and

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.530 
we'll hit all-time highs the euro and
probably<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.940> point<00:02:16.239> we'll<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
probably at that point we'll get a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.600 
probably at that point we'll get a
bottom<00:02:17.019> in<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> euro<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.010> looking<00:02:18.370> at<00:02:18.489> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
bottom in the euro and looking at the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.030 
bottom in the euro and looking at the
threat<00:02:18.879> side<00:02:19.150> Frank<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.870> seems<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.890> a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
threat side Frank it seems to be just a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.190 
threat side Frank it seems to be just a
question<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> US<00:02:21.849> dollar<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.480> think<00:02:23.140> that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
question of the US dollar I think that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.680 
question of the US dollar I think that
that's<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.980> real<00:02:24.220> key<00:02:24.550> part<00:02:24.910> because<00:02:25.330> there's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that's the real key part because there's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.680 
that's the real key part because there's
a<00:02:25.769> relationship<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.099> dollar<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.760> gold<00:02:28.390> is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
a relationship of the dollar to gold is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.199 
a relationship of the dollar to gold is
inverse<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.830> what<00:02:29.980> drives<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.580> dollar<00:02:30.879> are

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
inverse and what drives the dollar are

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.020 
inverse and what drives the dollar are
real<00:02:32.049> interest<00:02:32.739> rates<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.849> will

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
real interest rates that is what will

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.640 
real interest rates that is what will
the<00:02:34.120> government<00:02:34.269> pay<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.080> five-year

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the government pay you for a five-year

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.650 
the government pay you for a five-year
and<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> 10-year<00:02:36.310> government<00:02:36.459> bond<00:02:36.819> take<00:02:37.420> away

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and a 10-year government bond take away

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.140 
and a 10-year government bond take away
the<00:02:37.810> CPI<00:02:38.230> number<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.129> you<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> real<00:02:39.910> rate

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the CPI number and you have a real rate

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.539 
the CPI number and you have a real rate
of<00:02:40.180> return<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:41.260> big<00:02:41.680> run<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.129> we've<00:02:42.400> had

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
of return this big run that we've had

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.650 
of return this big run that we've had
for<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.940> past<00:02:42.970> decade<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.840> predominate<00:02:45.660> right

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
for the past decade is predominate right

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.500 
for the past decade is predominate right
now<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.440> US<00:02:47.829> has<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.340> strongest<00:02:48.880> positive

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
now the US has the strongest positive

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.900 
now the US has the strongest positive
real<00:02:49.750> rates<00:02:50.019> return<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:51.040> 5-year<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.880> 10-year

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
real rates return for 5-year and 10-year

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.839 
real rates return for 5-year and 10-year
government<00:02:52.360> bonds<00:02:52.989> whereas<00:02:53.560> Germany<00:02:54.250> euro

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
government bonds whereas Germany euro

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.089 
government bonds whereas Germany euro
France<00:02:55.360> are<00:02:55.599> all<00:02:55.720> negative<00:02:56.110> Japan<00:02:57.069> is

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
France are all negative Japan is

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.400 
France are all negative Japan is
negative<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> think<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.900> that's<00:02:59.140> what

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
negative so I think that that's what

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.229 
negative so I think that that's what
makes<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.860> dollar<00:03:00.099> stealth<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.700> they<00:03:01.000> don't

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
makes the dollar stealth and they don't

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.360 
makes the dollar stealth and they don't
have<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.750> raise<00:03:01.900> interest<00:03:02.319> rates<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.769> still

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
have to raise interest rates and still

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.490 
have to raise interest rates and still
remain<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.879> strongest<00:03:04.390> currency<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.319> you're

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
remain the strongest currency so you're

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.990 
remain the strongest currency so you're
still<00:03:05.769> sticking<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.459> Frank<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.879> know

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
still sticking to that Frank I know

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.130 
still sticking to that Frank I know
you've<00:03:07.150> said<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.540> since<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> start<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.079> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you've said that since the start of the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.390 
you've said that since the start of the
year<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.590> don't<00:03:08.739> think<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.010> Fed<00:03:09.190> will

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
year that you don't think the Fed will

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.699 
year that you don't think the Fed will
raise<00:03:10.030> rates<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.599> year<00:03:10.660> yeah<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.230> don't<00:03:11.470> think

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
raise rates this year yeah I don't think

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.949 
raise rates this year yeah I don't think
so<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.099> think<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.879> does<00:03:13.060> it'll<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:13.660> really

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
so I think if it does it'll just really

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.530 
so I think if it does it'll just really
dismantle<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> expert<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.640> export

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
dismantle the expert of the export

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.690 
dismantle the expert of the export
industry<00:03:17.079> in<00:03:17.139> America<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.859> make<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.519> more

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
industry in America and make it more

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.910 
industry in America and make it more
disruptive<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:19.900> we'll<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:20.590> how<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.859> unfolds

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
disruptive but we'll see how it unfolds

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.610 
disruptive but we'll see how it unfolds
but<00:03:21.910> whatever<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.690> happens<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:23.350> people

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
but whatever it happens is with people

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.650 
but whatever it happens is with people
have<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.859> take<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.069> look<00:03:24.190> at<00:03:24.400> gold<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.000> your<00:03:25.299> own

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.460 
very strong and one last thing before we
get<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.209> our<00:03:34.239> touchdown<00:03:34.480> pass<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.170> Frank

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
what about the correlation between a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.360 
what about the correlation between a
crude<00:03:37.540> oil<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.019> US<00:03:38.260> dollar<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.769> we<00:03:38.920> see<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
crude oil and the US dollar if we see a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.789 
crude oil and the US dollar if we see a
bottom<00:03:39.970> here<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.420> crude<00:03:40.780> does<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.349> mean<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
bottom here in crude does it mean a

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.520 
bottom here in crude does it mean a
signal<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:43.150> we<00:03:43.419> have<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.599> top<00:03:43.870> here<00:03:44.139> in<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.290> US

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
signal that we have a top here in the US

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.550 
signal that we have a top here in the US
dollar<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.130> think<00:03:45.730> that's<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.989> bottom<00:03:47.440> in

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
dollar I think that's a in the bottom in

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.710 
dollar I think that's a in the bottom in
the<00:03:47.650> price<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:48.010> oil<00:03:48.160> appears<00:03:48.669> to<00:03:48.849> be<00:03:49.000> strong

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the price of oil appears to be strong

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.949 
the price of oil appears to be strong

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
demand demand coming out of China the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.599 
demand demand coming out of China the
they're<00:03:53.349> paying<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.799> higher<00:03:53.980> price<00:03:54.310> now<00:03:54.549> to

Saudis<00:03:55.150> for<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.450> oil<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.989> think<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.799> that's

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
Saudis for the oil I think that that's

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.490 
Saudis for the oil I think that that's
been<00:03:57.220> more<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.609> factor<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.090> global<00:03:58.930> economic

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.110 
been more of a factor of global economic

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
activity and we mentioned this before

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.440 
activity and we mentioned this before
that<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.959> takes<00:04:02.200> about<00:04:02.380> six<00:04:02.889> to<00:04:03.010> nine<00:04:03.340> months

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
that it takes about six to nine months

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.360 
that it takes about six to nine months
from<00:04:04.450> my<00:04:04.599> shock<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:05.200> oil<00:04:05.530> falling<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.190> much

China<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:35.750> key<00:04:36.080> for<00:04:36.620> looking<00:04:36.920> at<00:04:37.040> resources

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
China is so key for looking at resources

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.970 
China is so key for looking at resources
and<00:04:37.970> has<00:04:38.390> another<00:04:38.690> significant<00:04:39.290> impact<00:04:39.740> on

and has another significant impact on
gold<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:41.030> copper<00:04:41.210> etc<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.500> think<00:04:42.650> that

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
gold and copper etc so I think that

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.070 
gold and copper etc so I think that
that's<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.340> key<00:04:43.550> part<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.510> capital

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
that's the key part and in the capital

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.320 
that's the key part and in the capital
markets<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.650> looking<00:04:45.950> at<00:04:46.070> equities<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.790> think

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
markets of looking at equities I think

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.720 
markets of looking at equities I think
the<00:04:47.450> big<00:04:47.630> push<00:04:47.870> back<00:04:48.200> against<00:04:49.010> barrick<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
the big push back against barrick is the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.660 
the big push back against barrick is the
big<00:04:49.940> news<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.500> compensation<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.950> think<00:04:52.460> in<00:04:52.580> the

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
big news on compensation I think in the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.070 
big news on compensation I think in the
mining<00:04:53.000> space<00:04:53.270> that's<00:04:53.720> what's<00:04:53.960> very

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
mining space that's what's very

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.770 
mining space that's what's very
important<00:04:54.710> from<00:04:55.640> the<00:04:55.850> big<00:04:56.060> cap<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.540> seeing
