00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
situation where you need to reproduce

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.470 
situation where you need to reproduce
exact<00:00:16.949> colors<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.550> example<00:00:17.609> right<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.330> i've

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
exact colors for example right here i've

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.630 
exact colors for example right here i've
got<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.779> real<00:00:18.990> funky<00:00:19.439> color<00:00:19.710> pink<00:00:20.310> brush

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
got this real funky color pink brush

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.470 
got this real funky color pink brush
here<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.470> color<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.859> incorrect<00:00:23.730> with

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
here and if my color is incorrect with

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
here and if my color is incorrect with
the<00:00:24.570> available<00:00:25.080> light<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.010> not

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the available light then this is not

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
the available light then this is not
going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> correct<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
going to be correct now the thing is is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
going to be correct now the thing is is
that<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> change<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.480> color

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that what is going to change the color

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
that what is going to change the color
if<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.439> ambient<00:00:32.219> lighting<00:00:32.399> around<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
if the ambient lighting around here is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
if the ambient lighting around here is
too<00:00:33.800> orange<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.190> too<00:00:35.399> green<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:35.969> something

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
too orange or too green or something

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.670 
too orange or too green or something
like<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> make<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
like that and that's going to make this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
like that and that's going to make this
too<00:00:37.950> orange<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> too<00:00:38.579> green<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> need

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
too orange and too green so what we need

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
too orange and too green so what we need
to<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.500> custom<00:00:40.860> white<00:00:41.040> balance<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to do with custom white balance is we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
to do with custom white balance is we
need<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> make<00:00:42.210> sure<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:44.100> have

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
need to make sure that we have

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
need to make sure that we have
calibrated<00:00:45.180> our<00:00:46.460> our<00:00:47.460> color<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.149> light<00:00:48.629> so

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
calibrated our our color of light so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
calibrated our our color of light so
that<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.010> perfectly<00:00:50.460> neutral<00:00:51.000> gray<00:00:51.180> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that it's a perfectly neutral gray like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.790 
that it's a perfectly neutral gray like
this<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.010> what<00:00:53.010> typically<00:00:53.309> happens<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:54.800> if

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this and what typically happens is if

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
this and what typically happens is if
you're<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> light<00:00:56.399> situation<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.210> kind

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you're in a light situation that's kind

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
you're in a light situation that's kind
of<00:00:57.539> strange<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.680> i've<00:00:59.039> got<00:00:59.160> one

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of strange like right here i've got one

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
of strange like right here i've got one
of<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.579> cool<00:00:59.789> little<00:00:59.969> mini<00:01:00.180> studios<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
has fluorescent light and fluorescent

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.929 
has fluorescent light and fluorescent
light<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.690> very<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.320> variable<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
light is very very variable it can be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
light is very very variable it can be
really<00:01:06.270> green<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.710> green

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really green or it can be not as green

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.380 
really green or it can be not as green
and<00:01:08.189> things<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and things like that so what we want to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
and things like that so what we want to
do<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.290> sure<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.250> have

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
do is we want to make sure that we have

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
do is we want to make sure that we have
a<00:01:11.760> custom<00:01:12.270> white<00:01:12.450> balance<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:13.080> means<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a custom white balance which means that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
a custom white balance which means that
the<00:01:13.799> light<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.409> coming<00:01:16.409> on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the light that's going to be coming on

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
the light that's going to be coming on
to<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.860> subject<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> completely<00:01:18.119> neutral<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to my subject is completely neutral and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.539 
to my subject is completely neutral and
that<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.750> give<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> hundred<00:01:19.229> percent

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
that will give you a hundred percent

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.960 
that will give you a hundred percent
accuracy<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> done<00:01:21.630> well

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
accuracy now how is that done well

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
accuracy now how is that done well
there's<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> couple<00:01:24.420> ways<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there's a couple ways to do it one is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
there's a couple ways to do it one is
you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.360> super

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can use one of these really super

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
you can use one of these really super
expensive<00:01:28.080> color<00:01:28.979> meters<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.450> thing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
expensive color meters and the thing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.710 
expensive color meters and the thing
about<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> color<00:01:31.950> meter<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:33.420> have

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
about a color meter is that they have

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
about a color meter is that they have
these<00:01:33.990> domes<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.520> happens

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
these domes you see that so what happens

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.410 
these domes you see that so what happens
with<00:01:36.060> these<00:01:36.180> domes<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> picks<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
with these domes is that it picks up the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
with these domes is that it picks up the
temperature<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> light<00:01:39.990> completely<00:01:40.470> all

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
temperature of the light completely all

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
temperature of the light completely all
the<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:40.979> around<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> room<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> very

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the way around the room so it's very

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.710 
the way around the room so it's very
important<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:44.600> round<00:01:45.600> like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
important that we have it round like

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.649 
important that we have it round like
that<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> bought<00:01:48.570> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that there are this one that I bought in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.109 
that there are this one that I bought in
the<00:01:48.689> store<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.259> 150<00:01:49.950> bucks<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the store for about 150 bucks and and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.569 
the store for about 150 bucks and and
it's<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.740> pattern<00:01:53.340> which

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it's it's got this little pattern which

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's it's got this little pattern which
picks<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.970> light<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
picks up light but the thing is is that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
picks up light but the thing is is that
it's<00:01:55.649> completely<00:01:56.189> flat<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.000> happens<00:01:57.360> is

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's completely flat and what happens is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
it's completely flat and what happens is
there's<00:01:58.020> light<00:01:58.290> coming<00:01:58.619> from<00:01:58.649> above<00:01:58.950> or

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
there's light coming from above or

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
there's light coming from above or
around<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> side<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> things<00:02:00.540> like

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
around the side and things like

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770 
around the side and things like
light<00:02:02.280> only<00:02:02.460> travels<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.299> straight<00:02:03.360> line

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
light only travels in a straight line

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
light only travels in a straight line
and<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.530> occur<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.400> won't<00:02:05.580> pick<00:02:05.760> up<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and not in occur so it won't pick up the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.250 
and not in occur so it won't pick up the
light<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.330> coming<00:02:06.659> around<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> sides

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
light that's coming around the sides

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.859 
light that's coming around the sides
that's<00:02:07.950> what's<00:02:08.250> cool<00:02:08.459> about<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:09.569> dome

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that's what's cool about these dome

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's what's cool about these dome
things<00:02:10.229> well<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.910> dome<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.720> comes<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:13.380> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
things well the dome that comes with a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
things well the dome that comes with a
lightsphere<00:02:13.770> collapsible<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.730> luckily

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
lightsphere collapsible is luckily

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.220 
lightsphere collapsible is luckily
neutral<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.560> also<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.209> dome<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
neutral and also it's a dome so what I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.760 
neutral and also it's a dome so what I
can<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:21.030> measure<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
can do is I can use this to measure the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.930 
can do is I can use this to measure the
color<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> light<00:02:23.220> completely<00:02:23.640> all<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
color of the light completely all the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.690 
color of the light completely all the
way<00:02:24.060> around<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.540> room<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.959> then<00:02:25.670> make<00:02:26.670> sure

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
way around the room and then make sure

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
way around the room and then make sure
that<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> neutral<00:02:27.660> color<00:02:27.900> balanced<00:02:28.319> so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
that I have a neutral color balanced so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.949 
that I have a neutral color balanced so
what<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.700> very<00:02:30.330> simple<00:02:30.780> is

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
what I'm going to do very very simple is

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.510 
what I'm going to do very very simple is
on<00:02:31.170> my<00:02:31.290> camera<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> take<00:02:32.489> a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
on my camera I'm going to take a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.870 
on my camera I'm going to take a
reference<00:02:32.790> image<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:34.590> very<00:02:34.920> good<00:02:35.580> idea

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
reference image and it's very good idea

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.970 
reference image and it's very good idea
to<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.390> manual<00:02:36.630> focus<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.380> else<00:02:37.470> you'll

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
to put it on manual focus or else you'll

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040 
to put it on manual focus or else you'll
never<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.550> thing<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.880> focus<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.480> now

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
never get this thing to focus and now

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.979 
never get this thing to focus and now
this<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.560> very<00:02:40.739> very<00:02:40.890> important<00:02:41.610> don't<00:02:42.209> go<00:02:42.720> up

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
this is very very important don't go up

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.410 
this is very very important don't go up
to<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.769> camera<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.400> shoot<00:02:44.700> toward<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to the camera and shoot toward the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.590 
to the camera and shoot toward the
subject<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.560> your<00:02:46.920> dome<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.390> what

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
subject with your dome on because what

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.970 
subject with your dome on because what
that<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.290> will<00:02:49.410> only<00:02:49.590> give<00:02:49.830> me

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that will do is that will only give me

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.650 
that will do is that will only give me
the<00:02:50.100> light<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.459> coming<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.209> around<00:02:51.420> me

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the light that's coming in all around me

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.290 
the light that's coming in all around me
right<00:02:52.230> here<00:02:52.470> where<00:02:52.650> I'm<00:02:52.769> standing<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.580> that's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
right here where I'm standing and that's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000 
right here where I'm standing and that's
not<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.660> light<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.989> want<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> measure<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.769> want

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
to measure the light that's where the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.990 
to measure the light that's where the
subject<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:59.100> be<00:02:59.220> or<00:02:59.430> say<00:02:59.819> for

example I'm doing a portrait and I want
to<00:03:01.590> do<00:03:01.680> an<00:03:01.769> accurate<00:03:01.980> color<00:03:02.459> I'll<00:03:03.030> put<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
to do an accurate color I'll put the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360 
to do an accurate color I'll put the
camera<00:03:03.720> right<00:03:03.750> next<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.380> my<00:03:04.530> subject<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.220> take

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
camera right next to my subject and take

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.020 
camera right next to my subject and take
a<00:03:05.400> picture<00:03:05.640> like<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.780> when<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.079> here

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
a picture like that but when I'm in here

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.220 
a picture like that but when I'm in here
and<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.180> wanted<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:10.049> good

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and I wanted to get a really good

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.130 
and I wanted to get a really good
accurate<00:03:11.100> color<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:12.060> I'll<00:03:12.180> do<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.840> I'll<00:03:13.110> just

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
accurate color what I'll do is I'll just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.190 
accurate color what I'll do is I'll just
go<00:03:13.500> ahead<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.100> put<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> camera<00:03:15.239> inside<00:03:15.780> here

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
go ahead and put the camera inside here

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.130 
go ahead and put the camera inside here
like<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.489> I'll<00:03:17.820> aim<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.360> lens<00:03:18.600> toward

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
like that and I'll aim the lens toward

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.740 
like that and I'll aim the lens toward
where<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.799> camera<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.459> that's<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
where the camera is and that's you and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.350 
where the camera is and that's you and
I'll<00:03:21.900> take<00:03:22.110> one<00:03:22.320> picture<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.360> that

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
I'll take one picture like this and that

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.690 
I'll take one picture like this and that
would<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:24.750> reference<00:03:25.140> image<00:03:25.290> now<00:03:25.709> when<00:03:26.549> we

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
would be my reference image now when we

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.870 
would be my reference image now when we
look<00:03:26.850> at<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.209> you'll<00:03:28.019> see<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.400> I'll

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
look at it you'll see that this is I'll

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.330 
look at it you'll see that this is I'll
just<00:03:30.030> hit<00:03:30.299> play<00:03:30.680> you'll<00:03:31.680> see<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
just hit play you'll see that this is

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330 
just hit play you'll see that this is
kind<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.940> bluish<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.440> simply

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
kind of a bluish and that's simply

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.920 
kind of a bluish and that's simply
because<00:03:35.370> there's<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.000> much<00:03:36.120> light<00:03:36.420> coming<00:03:36.780> in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
because there's so much light coming in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.740 
because there's so much light coming in
from<00:03:37.910> different<00:03:38.910> light<00:03:39.060> sources<00:03:39.450> that's

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
from different light sources that's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.910 
from different light sources that's
completely<00:03:40.320> confusing<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.040> again<00:03:42.590> we<00:03:43.590> want<00:03:43.859> to

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
completely confusing it again we want to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.130 
completely confusing it again we want to
have<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.310> light<00:03:44.519> look<00:03:45.000> exactly<00:03:45.329> like<00:03:45.540> this

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.020 

not<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.430> what<00:03:50.579> happens<00:03:50.910> with

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
not like this so what happens with

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.060 
not like this so what happens with
custom<00:03:51.420> white<00:03:51.570> balancing<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.769> going<00:03:52.980> to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
custom white balancing is it's going to

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.520 
custom white balancing is it's going to
take<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.579> light<00:03:53.880> here<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.480> turn<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.320> into

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
take this light here and turn it into

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.890 
take this light here and turn it into
this<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.340> when<00:03:56.579> it's<00:03:56.820> neutral<00:03:57.329> like<00:03:57.540> this

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
this and when it's neutral like this

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.140 
this and when it's neutral like this
that<00:03:58.590> means<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.010> you've<00:03:59.160> got<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.609> perfect

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
that means that you've got a perfect

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.650 
that means that you've got a perfect
color<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:01.109> it's<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.579> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
color is it's like it's it's the the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.300 
color is it's like it's it's the the
calibrating<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
calibrating of the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.520 
calibrating of the
color<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.880> that's<00:04:05.480> basically<00:04:05.930> how<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.170> do<00:04:06.380> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
color and that's basically how we do the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.650 
color and that's basically how we do the
live<00:04:06.709> calibration<00:04:07.520> now<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.270> camera

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
live calibration now the in camera

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.150 
live calibration now the in camera
setups<00:04:09.020> different<00:04:09.680> for<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.890> different

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
setups different for the different

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.410 
setups different for the different
cameras<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.640> I'll<00:04:10.730> show<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:10.910> how<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.270> works

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
cameras and I'll show you how that works

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.260 
cameras and I'll show you how that works
for<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.959> different<00:04:12.290> models

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
for all the different models

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.629 
for all the different models
