00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
then I have my wii I believe this is the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600

second<00:01:32.610> generation<00:01:33.470> I'm<00:01:34.470> pretty<00:01:35.310> sure<00:01:35.460> they

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
second generation I'm pretty sure they

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.100 
second generation I'm pretty sure they
made<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:35.970> generations<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.689> them<00:01:36.810> because

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
made two generations of them because

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.010 
made two generations of them because
this<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.560> different<00:01:37.740> than<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.610> ones<00:01:39.020> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
this one is different than other ones to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.620 
this one is different than other ones to
me<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.740> seems<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.270> one
