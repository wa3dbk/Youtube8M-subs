00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.260
 Welcome to the tech news of the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.380
 week 7 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.849
 and we start again with the gtx 970 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.500
 and that's about it again 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.230
 memory problem meanwhile have become 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.329
 Some dealers have registered and it has been 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.390
 then it confirms that actually 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.609
 There were surprisingly few returns and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.989
 among the returnees were also 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.599
 sometimes not even that 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.630
 memory problem as a reason 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.180
 but some use even then 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.890
 just the current events around 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.570
 simpler graphics card because of the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
 to give gay fitness back so 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.070
 Here also a clever action that one 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.740
 just times the courendte dealers 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 take advantage of his card with 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.790
 to give back to gay deep 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.470
 but as I said there was really only a lot 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.760
 little regression and I can 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.079
 Actually I understand too 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.170
 not really expected it now 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.420
 There are many returns because the 970 is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.420
 nevertheless one of the best graphics cards 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.579
 for the price and most will be with you 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.119
 just live this little problem 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.280
 can 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.619
 There is simply no right one 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 alternative that's why I already knew 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.700
 that it is not really too much 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.429
 it will continue to come 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.130
 with nvidia and that may be soon 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.569
 that nvidia shield tablet 2 presented 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.060
 There is definitely the third 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.039
 third that is in March one 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.659
 Announcement from nvidia but what exactly 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.700
 is not yet known but 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.530
 So far, all speculate that it is 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.200
 the second version of the nvidia shield 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.749
 tablet is acting and nvidia has too 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.090
 confirmed that the tegra saved up 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.939
 in any case the focus on the automobiles 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.649
 and the gaming lays down is either 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.719
 itself steady and therefore 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.219
 underpinned is again all that 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.670
 it's probably this 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.779
 nvidia shield tablet 2 will act then 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.939
 there is one more here 

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:58.609
 interesting benchmark by i 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.889
 wolf there were 14 graphics cards in the 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.749
 Comparison tested and wanted 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.420
 Just show it for a minute because I have it 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.759
 damn interesting if you look 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.970
 always the full hd resolution is looked at 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.990
 the gtx 480 at the very front at about 9 o'clock 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.180
 percent if you now but 4k or 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.310
 hd resolution 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 simply have the amd cards change 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.939
 still process so the com with 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.140
 higher resolution simply still one 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.849
 better clear 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.090
 clear the clock the resolution is always 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.670
 still unplayable would be with 24 fps 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.319
 no one likes to play but even in 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.889
 the 2k resolution is gr 990x before 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.170
 texts 980 so respect for something 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.670
 older to the cards and I'm up 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.670
 every case really curious what is in there 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.090
 future of amd will come in this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.349
 news is about directx 12 because that is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.060
 yes so the contrast to the coats off and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.000
 There are now some benchmarks 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.840
 surfaced and confirm that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.900
 between the human api and thus x12 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.010
 are severely degrading takes place and that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.639
 the two are actually the same size 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.700
 or 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.230
 are equally good but it will be 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.590
 talked about that the coat 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.349
 become mentally ap meanwhile then meaningless 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.919
 is because with windows 10 becomes the 36 12 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.069
 come and windows just so far 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.699
 more widespread and also offers for one 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.650
 video and amd cards because x12 and wants 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.870
 that's why the coats off like 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.519
 likely to be displaced 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.109
 because even the game developers are 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.659
 definitely not the effort in the future 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.549
 operate and both apis with adapted 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.790
 software release 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.919
 that's why I would say x12 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.599
 the future and ever said succinctly though 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.459
 for the meantime quite good for some 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.329
 but games will not be in the future 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.349
 be relevant 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.849
 Now we come to the as I think 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.799
 most interesting news of the week 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.629
 every case and it came out only yesterday 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.659
 and that was really extreme 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.120
 surprised apple wants an automobile with 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.400
 build electric drive so there I have 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.019
 really thought if this is a joke 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.319
 I mean we really talk about 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.139
 apple the iphone ipad 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.269
 max whatever and who want 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.400
 really make a car so that 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.789
 most valuable company in the world wants 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.199
 I have an electric car to produce 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.570
 at first not believed but it is 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.320
 so interesting so I'm here 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.449
 really blown away and happy 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.150
 really on the release or 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.039
 on the new info if there is new too 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.509
 then it is really damn 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.669
 of course, apple has that 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.789
 necessary small change around now for example 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.530
 either to build factory halls or 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.810
 easy to lift for the whole project 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.430
 and what has since particularly surprised 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.130
 that apple just so many 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.849
 Employees have been recruited eg by tesla 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.169
 of mercedes-benz of all sorts 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.580
 carmakers 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.919
 that is, they want to be so, so to speak 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.280
 know how to buy because they have 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:09.780
 really real with some co-workers 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.900
 Negotiated contracts negotiated and bonuses 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.520
 in the amount of up to $ 250,000 for 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.370
 contracts are given 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.320
 So, I'll tell you who would not be there 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.180
 say if now apple with an offer 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.220
 yes man is working is the burr 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.639
 at tester or at mercedes benz 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.500
 when you come to us and for us at the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.539
 and the project evolves on that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.370
 car you are coming to 50,000 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.020
 euro and again a blatant 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.120
 Salary surcharge so I think there would 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.009
 almost no one say no and the project 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.259
 just sounds so interesting that 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.389
 I because the staff understand that 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.259
 there have opted for apple and 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.449
 then changed 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.970
 So it would be really damn interesting 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.949
 I really like your opinion 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.690
 to hear if apple that really 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.849
 can somehow manage to do something 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.219
 bring out the revolutionary if the 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.340
 maybe an electro somehow yes 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:02.039
 innovate maybe make better 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.229
 can because with current cars with 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.349
 electric drive or battery is yes 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.840
 still partially many problems too 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.060
 with the range that you just only 3 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.340
 400 kilometers far there is so 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.620
 massive problems and that's why I would 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.289
 I'm really interested in what you think about it 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.190
 Hold and I'll do it all to everyone 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.169
 keep an eye on your case 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.699
 the whole thing is project titan 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.090
 and I would say that it is one 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.069
 reasonable name so there 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.499
 supposedly up to 1000 at the time 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.960
 Apple employees. Employees with it 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:35.860
 Be busy and I'm really there 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.080
 really excited 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.969
 We look forward to seeing you in the 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.650
 Write comments and then we see 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.590
 join us again the next week 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.969
 tech news makes a good start in the 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.300
 week and until next time people 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.300
 Zschau
