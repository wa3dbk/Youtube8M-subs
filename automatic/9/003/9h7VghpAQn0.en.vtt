00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello everyone this video is for 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.400
 inaugurate this second channel that 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.349
 called new android is a channel that goes 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.150
 to be dedicated exclusively to 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.029
 talk about videogames and do then riu 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.429
 playlists for android like this 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.170
 we're seeing here too as 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.539
 possibly we will do for others 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.730
 platforms but for now just dedicate 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.439
 to games for our phone 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.660
 android this way that we are seeing it 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.510
 call all of mini zombies an excellent 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 game 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.410
 that you can download for free from the play 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 so let's start a level and let's 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.910
 to see what it is about 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.030
 The first thing we see is that this game 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.920
 has some scenarios in third 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.710
 dimension or an environment in which it will be 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.360
 dimension that looks very good our 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.020
 mission is to exterminate all the zombies 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.950
 that appear on the screen 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.870
 in order to overcome each mission every day 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.390
 let's go that there are many zombies that go 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.660
 appearing on the road 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.850
 so we have to guarantee and treat 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 of survive 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.080
 Sometimes we are going to put something difficult 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 so we have to 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.189
 we have to run to be able 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.189
 accommodate us well 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.540
 we see that there are different types of zombies 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.950
 well there's part of the game we're going to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.130
 try again this is a game 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.200
 pretty entertaining 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.360
 and the best part is that it's free 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.360
 so it's worth it to download it 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 you do not have to give cars an advantage 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 do not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.110
 we go 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 to lose the game 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.480
 how are the dogs too 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.489
 good common 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.930
 well I recommend this new memory 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.970
 there I like to give you a hand up 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.269
 climbing up foot we'll see you in a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.269
 next
