 is an aesthetically important area 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.330
 therefore the loss of even one tooth is quite 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 visible and serious 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.500

 missing one or more teeth

 you can restore them with 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.500
 implant the implant is artificial 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 the root is most often made of titanium 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 which are installed in the maxillary 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.850
 bone to replace a lost tooth in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.280
 subsequently attached to this implant 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 removable and fixed dentures 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 Like every implanted tooth consists 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.530
 From 3 parts the first is titanium root 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.050
 shaped vintage most 2 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 this is about admin binder 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.230
 element between the titanium root and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.649
 proper tooth crown and fasten 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.229
 oh complan tattoo with screw and 3 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.470
 proper short tooth which can 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 to be single or bridge 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.490
 the classic form operation on 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.390
 tooth implantation consists of two stages 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.950
 the first is the installation 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 artificial tooth root which 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.049
 supports dental prosthesis 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.270
 after that it is necessary from two to 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.420
 four months to implant 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 strengthened in the jawbone I got used to it 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 if necessary, the patient may 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.220
 making artificial tooth 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 crowns right on the day of surgery on the second 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.310
 the final stage, the doctor reveals 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 previously introduced blunt from and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.950
 sets it special 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.280
 gum former 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.979
 after two weeks implant 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 set back on which 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.790
 subsequently made crown 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.619
 which can be made of metal 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.650
 metal ceramics porcelain or dioxide 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.260
 zirconium 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.140
 large variety of implants and 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.990
 crowns allows the patient to make a choice 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.320
 ideally deciding his aesthetic 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.200
 problem implantation is done under 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.200
 local anesthesia and anesthesia not required 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.470
 implantation as you had the opportunity 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.600
 make sure it can completely solve 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.850
 the problem of missing teeth major 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.830
 questions that probably arise what 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.900
 the amount of time it takes 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.210
 and how much will implantation cost 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.860
 the answers to these questions are you 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.860
