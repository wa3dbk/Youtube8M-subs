okay<00:00:02.710> so<00:00:02.770> we're<00:00:03.040> here<00:00:03.070> up<00:00:03.400> on<00:00:03.580> a<00:00:03.610> roof<00:00:03.970> flat

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:04.660 
okay so we're here up on a roof flat

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.360 
okay so we're here up on a roof flat
roof<00:00:04.899> in<00:00:05.109> the<00:00:05.200> middle<00:00:05.410> of<00:00:05.470> the<00:00:05.559> winter<00:00:05.800> time<00:00:06.189> to

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
roof in the middle of the winter time to

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.759 
roof in the middle of the winter time to
talk<00:00:06.550> to<00:00:06.700> you<00:00:06.790> about<00:00:06.910> drifting<00:00:07.389> snow<00:00:07.930> and<00:00:08.290> the

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
talk to you about drifting snow and the

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.370 
talk to you about drifting snow and the
proper<00:00:09.070> the<00:00:09.640> havoc<00:00:10.480> they<00:00:10.690> can<00:00:10.900> wreak<00:00:11.170> on

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
proper the havoc they can wreak on

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.180 
proper the havoc they can wreak on
seamed<00:00:11.910> roofing<00:00:12.910> systems<00:00:13.510> now<00:00:14.140> you<00:00:14.680> see<00:00:14.920> here

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
seamed roofing systems now you see here

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.040 
seamed roofing systems now you see here
this<00:00:15.340> is<00:00:15.550> a<00:00:15.580> drift<00:00:16.029> it's<00:00:16.330> about<00:00:16.539> six<00:00:16.869> to<00:00:17.019> eight

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
this is a drift it's about six to eight

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.859 
this is a drift it's about six to eight
inches<00:00:17.109> thick<00:00:17.560> runs<00:00:18.520> from<00:00:18.820> this<00:00:19.000> box<00:00:19.360> area

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
inches thick runs from this box area

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.140

here<00:00:20.110> right<00:00:20.260> over<00:00:20.440> to<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.830> edge<00:00:20.980> now<00:00:21.670> when

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
here right over to the edge now when

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.769 
here right over to the edge now when
snow<00:00:22.690> first<00:00:23.619> lands<00:00:24.250> on<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.400> roof<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:25.510> wind

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
snow first lands on a roof the wind

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.260 
snow first lands on a roof the wind
blows<00:00:26.110> it<00:00:26.380> around<00:00:26.770> corners<00:00:27.430> or<00:00:27.609> whatever<00:00:28.090> way

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
blows it around corners or whatever way

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.240 
blows it around corners or whatever way
the<00:00:28.420> roof<00:00:28.600> is<00:00:28.810> situated<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.560> can<00:00:29.680> also<00:00:29.830> blow<00:00:30.130> it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
the roof is situated it can also blow it

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.920 
the roof is situated it can also blow it
from<00:00:30.430> an<00:00:30.520> upper<00:00:30.820> roof<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.210> lower<00:00:31.449> roof<00:00:31.689> and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
from an upper roof to a lower roof and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.500 
from an upper roof to a lower roof and
create<00:00:32.169> drifts<00:00:32.590> up<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.920> ten<00:00:33.519> fifteen<00:00:34.089> feet

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
create drifts up to ten fifteen feet

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.529 
create drifts up to ten fifteen feet
high<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.739> when<00:00:36.249> it<00:00:36.370> first<00:00:36.579> lands<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.210> drift

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
high well when it first lands the drift

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.439 
high well when it first lands the drift
isn't<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.050> big<00:00:38.260> deal<00:00:38.499> it's<00:00:39.190> after<00:00:39.909> that<00:00:40.300> the

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
isn't a big deal it's after that the

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.329 
isn't a big deal it's after that the
drift<00:00:40.719> is<00:00:40.899> sitting<00:00:41.199> there<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.620> storms<00:00:42.100> over

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
drift is sitting there the storms over

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.939 
drift is sitting there the storms over
the<00:00:42.909> temperature<00:00:43.329> then<00:00:43.600> warms<00:00:44.050> up<00:00:44.260> above<00:00:44.530> zero

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
the temperature then warms up above zero

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.789 
the temperature then warms up above zero
well<00:00:45.249> the<00:00:45.670> drift<00:00:46.149> starts<00:00:46.510> melting<00:00:46.749> when<00:00:47.649> you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
well the drift starts melting when you

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.750 
well the drift starts melting when you
get<00:00:48.039> this<00:00:48.549> much<00:00:48.879> snow<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.569> it<00:00:49.809> starts<00:00:50.199> melting

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
get this much snow and it starts melting

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.430 
get this much snow and it starts melting
what<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.879> does<00:00:52.089> is<00:00:52.359> it<00:00:52.479> creates<00:00:52.839> pressure<00:00:53.139> on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
what it does is it creates pressure on

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.930 
what it does is it creates pressure on
the<00:00:53.559> roof<00:00:53.739> system<00:00:54.129> because<00:00:54.339> this<00:00:54.519> snow<00:00:54.760> is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
the roof system because this snow is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.969 
the roof system because this snow is
light<00:00:55.209> when<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.539> first<00:00:55.749> lands<00:00:56.289> but<00:00:56.679> when<00:00:56.859> it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
light when it first lands but when it

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.259 
light when it first lands but when it
warms<00:00:57.219> up<00:00:57.579> it<00:00:57.850> turns<00:00:58.089> more<00:00:59.309> water<00:01:00.309> content<00:01:01.119> in

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
warms up it turns more water content in

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.270 
warms up it turns more water content in
the<00:01:01.359> snow<00:01:01.600> creates<00:01:02.319> a<00:01:02.440> lot<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.679> pressure<00:01:03.069> on

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
the snow creates a lot of pressure on

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
the snow creates a lot of pressure on
the<00:01:03.819> flat<00:01:04.119> roof<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.440> get<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:05.890> much<00:01:06.160> drift

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the flat roof so you get this much drift

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.810 
the flat roof so you get this much drift
it<00:01:07.750> then<00:01:08.130> pressurizes<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.160> roof<00:01:09.460> when<00:01:09.700> it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
it then pressurizes the roof when it

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.630 
it then pressurizes the roof when it
heats<00:01:10.000> up<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.570> when<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.590> have<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.740> seam<00:01:12.040> system

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
heats up and when you have a seam system

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.660 
heats up and when you have a seam system
it<00:01:12.820> really<00:01:13.510> works<00:01:13.810> at<00:01:14.110> those<00:01:14.380> seams<00:01:14.800> so<00:01:15.370> if<00:01:15.580> you

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
it really works at those seams so if you

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.780 
it really works at those seams so if you
have<00:01:15.820> seams<00:01:16.120> in<00:01:16.390> your<00:01:16.570> roof<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.290> drift

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
have seams in your roof the drift

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.580 
have seams in your roof the drift
pressurizes<00:01:18.790> pushes<00:01:19.660> into<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.020> seams<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
pressurizes pushes into the seams and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
pressurizes pushes into the seams and
that's<00:01:20.860> why<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.490> get<00:01:21.670> swamped<00:01:22.360> with<00:01:22.510> calls

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that's why we get swamped with calls

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.700 
that's why we get swamped with calls

to<00:01:57.850> push<00:01:58.090> into<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.690> that's<00:01:59.170> why<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.100> get

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
to push into and that's why we get

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.040 
to push into and that's why we get
swamped<00:02:00.610> in<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.000> spring<00:02:01.330> because<00:02:01.810> other

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
swamped in the spring because other

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.290 
swamped in the spring because other
roofers<00:02:02.560> are<00:02:02.710> putting<00:02:03.010> seam<00:02:03.280> systems<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.030> and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
roofers are putting seam systems on and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.540 
roofers are putting seam systems on and
we<00:02:04.810> get<00:02:04.990> calls<00:02:05.260> for<00:02:05.530> those<00:02:05.770> other<00:02:06.010> roofs<00:02:06.310> for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
we get calls for those other roofs for

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.960 
we get calls for those other roofs for
full<00:02:06.729> replacements<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.540> repairs
