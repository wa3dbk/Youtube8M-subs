00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.820 
at war has a little bit of host
migration<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:23.050> little<00:03:23.200> migrate<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.739> the

migration a little migrate it in the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.460 
migration a little migrate it in the
lobby<00:03:24.040> not<00:03:24.400> during<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> game<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:26.320> have

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
lobby not during the game so you have

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.020 
lobby not during the game so you have
less<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.950> chance<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.340> get<00:03:27.459> hosts<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:27.880> this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
less of a chance to get hosts but this

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.199 
less of a chance to get hosts but this
works<00:03:28.300> flawlessly<00:03:28.920> every<00:03:29.920> single<00:03:30.250> time<00:03:30.430> every

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
works flawlessly every single time every

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.330 
works flawlessly every single time every
time<00:03:31.390> I've<00:03:31.510> tried<00:03:31.660> it's<00:03:32.020> worked<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.410> way<00:03:32.590> so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
time I've tried it's worked this way so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.160 
time I've tried it's worked this way so
