00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.000
 hi friends today we are going to make milanesas 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.730
 super crispy chicken 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.950
 we need a beaten egg breasts 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.559
 chicken and cereal flakes type that 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.589
 well let's start by taking the 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.270
 cereals and we're going to crush them we're going to 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.330
 Crush them so that they remain 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.550
 little pieces 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.250
 once it is us the pieces 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 little ones are ready to batter 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.330
 good here we are the egg 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.160
 and remember that chicken breasts 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 they have to be dry so that the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.879
 batter be perfect mohamed las 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.879
 chicken breasts 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.269
 and we had it for the cereals 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.500
 I to the cereals I put a little bit of 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.739
 salt since being sweet then for 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.130
 remove the report I put a little bit of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.720
 Salt 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.650
 so they do not have to stay pretty 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.650
 batter 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.190
 and we repeat the steps 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 for how many lettuces you have for 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 repeat the same step 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.040
 these breasts the truth is that it caused me 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.220
 pretty curious since being 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 battered with cereals 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 it hit me a little 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.850
 So, well, I decided to try them 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 and the truth is that they do not disappoint and I 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.229
 I recommend I start frying them in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.759
 the oil hot and nothing and you have to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.340
 be on top of them because right away 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.850
 they get brunette so they do not know 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 burn us 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:53.009
 and we turn and see nothing after a while and 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.009
 They are very golden 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.460
 once they are golden brown 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.000
 We take out the oil and put them on 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.230
 a kitchen paper to remove the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.230
 excess oil 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.240
 and then you can accompany it with the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.420
 garrison that you want as much as with 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.800
 some potatoes or as with a salad that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.800
 already to taste of each one 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.090
 we will do on paper to channel 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.129
 that oil and there you have it with the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.350
 potatoes you have to try the ones that are 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.370
