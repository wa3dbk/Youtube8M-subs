like brian rose doesn't really have that
much<00:02:04.530> power<00:02:04.590> I'm<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.280> 25<00:02:05.759> after<00:02:06.829> 27

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
much power I'm in 25 after 27

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
much power I'm in 25 after 27
professional<00:02:08.429> fights<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:08.849> only<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.239> seven

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
professional fights he only have seven

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.100 
professional fights he only have seven
knockouts<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:11.370> 25<00:02:11.910> wins<00:02:12.120> by<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> 25

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
knockouts and that's 25 wins by the 25

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.890 
knockouts and that's 25 wins by the 25
wins<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
wins and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
wins and
those<00:02:14.290> are<00:02:14.560> by<00:02:15.400> knockout<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.560> yet<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.590> tells<00:02:17.860> me

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
those are by knockout so yet it tells me

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.380 
those are by knockout so yet it tells me
that<00:02:18.010> he<00:02:18.549> doesn't<00:02:18.670> really<00:02:18.939> have<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.150> much

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that he doesn't really have that much

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.509 
that he doesn't really have that much
power<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.409> like<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:20.860> said<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.069> think<00:02:21.159> he<00:02:21.430> can

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
power but like I said I think he can

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.270 
power but like I said I think he can
make<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.849> competitive<00:02:22.420> fight<00:02:22.629> he<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.959> win

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
make this a competitive fight he can win

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.179 
make this a competitive fight he can win
probably<00:02:24.280> four<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:24.730> five<00:02:25.060> rounds<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.980> his

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
probably four or five rounds for his

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.059 
probably four or five rounds for his
activity<00:02:27.819> may<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.299> first<00:02:28.540> six<00:02:29.170> rounds<00:02:29.590> who

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
activity may be the first six rounds who

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.410 
activity may be the first six rounds who
knows<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.939> just<00:02:31.299> think<00:02:31.390> Demetrius<00:02:32.200> Android

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
knows but I just think Demetrius Android

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.550 
knows but I just think Demetrius Android
Stu<00:02:34.420> skilled<00:02:34.720> my<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.230> guy<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.409> just

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
Stu skilled my I think the guy is just

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.250 
Stu skilled my I think the guy is just
too<00:02:35.799> skilled<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.250> think<00:02:36.459> he<00:02:36.579> will<00:02:36.870> dance<00:02:37.870> around

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
too skilled I think he will dance around

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.550 
too skilled I think he will dance around
bryan<00:02:38.620> rose<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.220> probably<00:02:40.379> school<00:02:41.379> him

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
bryan rose and probably school him
