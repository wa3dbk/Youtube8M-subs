00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.430 
her kind of flawless natural finished
looks<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> thought<00:00:45.900> that<00:00:46.080> she<00:00:46.290> would

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
looks and so I thought that she would

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.490 
looks and so I thought that she would
make<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:47.010> great<00:00:47.280> tinted<00:00:47.879> moisturizer

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
make a really great tinted moisturizer

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
make a really great tinted moisturizer
so<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.040> an<00:00:50.430> SPF<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.059> 20<00:00:51.449> it's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so this one is an SPF of 20 it's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.259 
so this one is an SPF of 20 it's
oil-free<00:00:52.530> she<00:00:53.129> does<00:00:53.339> make<00:00:53.580> another<00:00:53.970> version

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
oil-free she does make another version

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.350 
oil-free she does make another version
that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.619> oil-free<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:56.549> if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:57.030> more

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that is not oil-free so if you are more

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.689 
that is not oil-free so if you are more
on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> dry<00:00:57.809> side<00:00:57.839> or<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.860> winter<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.220> then

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
on the dry side or it's winter time then

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.520 
on the dry side or it's winter time then

is<00:02:17.440> what<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.920> looks<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.370> swatch<00:02:18.970> wise<00:02:19.769> and

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
is what this looks like swatch wise and

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.819 
is what this looks like swatch wise and
this<00:02:21.760> nude<00:02:22.090> shade<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.720> again<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> really<00:02:23.470> great

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
this nude shade is again a really great

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.539 
this nude shade is again a really great
match<00:02:24.100> for<00:02:24.489> me<00:02:25.170> okay<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.250> kind<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
match for me okay and if you can kind of

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.150 
match for me okay and if you can kind of
see<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.000> consistency<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:29.019> much<00:02:29.320> lighter<00:02:29.709> it's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
see the consistency is much lighter it's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.090 
see the consistency is much lighter it's
very<00:02:30.549> kind<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.180> light<00:02:31.840> compared<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> argan

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
very kind of light compared to the argan

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.090 
very kind of light compared to the argan
oil<00:02:33.130> josie<00:02:33.820> maran<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:35.799> it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
oil josie maran one and that way it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.460 
oil josie maran one and that way it's
much<00:02:36.489> lighter<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.239> doesn't<00:02:37.900> feel<00:02:38.049> as<00:02:38.230> heavy

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
much lighter and doesn't feel as heavy

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.699 
much lighter and doesn't feel as heavy
so<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.519> enjoy<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.440> has<00:02:41.680> a

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
so I really enjoy that and it has a

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.160 
so I really enjoy that and it has a
pretty<00:02:42.100> good<00:02:42.430> coverage<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.180> would<00:02:43.720> call<00:02:43.959> this

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pretty good coverage I would call this

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.140 
pretty good coverage I would call this
more<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.709> light<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.220> medium<00:02:45.400> coverage

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
more of a light to medium coverage

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.830 
more of a light to medium coverage
I<00:02:46.420> think<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.260> Josie<00:02:47.769> Maran<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.370> has<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> much<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I think the Josie Maran one has a much a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.340 
I think the Josie Maran one has a much a
little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.799> heavier<00:02:51.670> coverage<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:53.140> bit

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
little bit heavier coverage a little bit

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.650 
little bit heavier coverage a little bit
more<00:02:53.530> foolproof<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.670> one<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:55.359> bit

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
more foolproof this one is a little bit

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.080 
more foolproof this one is a little bit
more<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.260> lighter<00:02:56.530> side<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.850> still

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
more on the lighter side but it's still

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.569 
more on the lighter side but it's still
a<00:02:58.150> much<00:02:58.450> better<00:02:58.720> than<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.470> origins<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
a much better than the origins one and

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.220 
a much better than the origins one and
it's<00:03:00.700> still<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.090> would<00:03:01.390> call<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.840> light<00:03:02.049> to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it's still I would call it a light to

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.110 
it's still I would call it a light to
medium<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.859> it<00:03:02.950> does<00:03:03.130> give<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.549> pretty<00:03:03.850> good

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
medium so it does give you a pretty good

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
medium so it does give you a pretty good
amount<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.510> coverage<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.650> definitely<00:03:06.160> get

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
amount of coverage you definitely get

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.430 
amount of coverage you definitely get
away<00:03:06.609> with<00:03:06.850> just<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.239> little<00:03:07.690> bit<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.140> spot

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
away with just a little bit of spot

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.740 
away with just a little bit of spot
concealment<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.640> setting<00:03:10.120> power<00:03:10.359> and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
concealment and then a setting power and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.220 
concealment and then a setting power and
this

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
this

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.820 
this
great<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.330> really<00:03:13.720> do<00:03:13.900> like<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.349> tinted

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
great so I really do like this tinted

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.100 
great so I really do like this tinted
moisturizer<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.849> this<00:03:16.000> kind<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.420> became<00:03:16.810> my

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
moisturizer and this kind of became my

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.710 
moisturizer and this kind of became my
everyday<00:03:17.650> favorite<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.299> was<00:03:19.450> oil

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
everyday favorite because it was oil

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.890 
everyday favorite because it was oil
free<00:03:20.140> at<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.860> end<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> day<00:03:21.519> my<00:03:21.909> t-zone<00:03:22.659> was

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
free at the end of the day my t-zone was

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.530 
free at the end of the day my t-zone was
not<00:03:23.110> nearly<00:03:23.440> as<00:03:23.620> oily<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.849> feels<00:03:25.209> really

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
not nearly as oily it feels really

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.229 
not nearly as oily it feels really
lightweight<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.620> goes<00:03:26.890> on<00:03:27.099> pretty<00:03:27.459> smooth<00:03:27.849> and

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
favorite tinted moisturizer because it's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.050 
favorite tinted moisturizer because it's
on<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.090> oil-free<00:03:43.690> side<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.879> because<00:03:45.879> it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
on the oil-free side and because it

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.430

just<00:03:51.190> click<00:03:51.609> feature<00:03:51.849> here<00:03:52.359> because<00:03:52.750> I'm

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
just click feature here because I'm

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.150 
just click feature here because I'm
supposed<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.379> be<00:03:53.500> uploading<00:03:54.040> these

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
supposed to be uploading these

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.860 
supposed to be uploading these
separately<00:03:54.609> but<00:03:55.030> they're<00:03:55.180> turning<00:03:55.480> into<00:03:55.720> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
separately but they're turning into a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
separately but they're turning into a
little<00:03:56.200> bit<00:03:56.440> kind<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.859> blend<00:03:57.160> video<00:03:57.609> I'm

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
little bit kind of a blend video I'm

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.319 
little bit kind of a blend video I'm
sorry<00:03:58.329> about<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.599> but<00:03:59.640> that<00:04:00.640> one<00:04:00.849> is<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.209> a

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
sorry about that but that one is just a

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.420 
sorry about that but that one is just a
little<00:04:01.569> bit<00:04:01.690> heavier<00:04:02.109> coverage<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.129> it's

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
little bit heavier coverage so it's

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.670 
little bit heavier coverage so it's
better<00:04:03.640> if<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.450> know<00:04:04.599> if<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.379> more

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
better if you know if I have more

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.619 
better if you know if I have more
blemishes<00:04:06.310> or<00:04:06.640> if<00:04:06.700> my<00:04:06.849> skin<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.269> just<00:04:07.329> not

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
blemishes or if my skin is just not

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.300 
blemishes or if my skin is just not
acting<00:04:07.870> right<00:04:08.290> then<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.769> one<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.099> little

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
acting right then that one is a little

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.640 
acting right then that one is a little
bit<00:04:09.489> better<00:04:09.640> but<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:10.629> my<00:04:10.750> skin's<00:04:11.079> being<00:04:11.349> nice

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
bit better but if my skin's being nice
