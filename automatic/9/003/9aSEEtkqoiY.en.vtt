00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
which I guess

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.840 
which I guess
it's<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> show<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:16.430> yeah<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.610> thing<00:02:17.820> is

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
it's with the show so yeah this thing is

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.180 
it's with the show so yeah this thing is
big<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.900> impressive<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.740> do<00:02:19.800> like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
big it's really impressive and I do like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.420 
big it's really impressive and I do like
it<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.850> articulation<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.200> arms<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.830> move<00:02:22.860> up

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it for articulation the arms can move up

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
it for articulation the arms can move up
and<00:02:23.730> down<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.340> move<00:02:26.520> back<00:02:27.360> although

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and down and they can move back although

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.170
