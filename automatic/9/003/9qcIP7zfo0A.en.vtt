00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.489
 teachers of pre-basic and basic education from first to fourth year 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.470
 In addition to the technical heads and specialists in language the system 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.669
 Municipal education of San Felipe 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.239
 They received intense training in the light reading and writing method 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.519
 nothing developed in dependencies of the education directorate 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.559
 and they were delivered by nelson colazo with sales professor and coauthor of this 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.570
 system of signs 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 at the end of the training cycle 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 each director of the municipal educational establishment received material 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.680
 aute or visual 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 to be putin and taste in the the big house of this method 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.870
 about this nelson literacy system or the famous one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 noted that it is a method that his mother devised from 1930 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.830
 there was a failure 1925 teaching children with the olea method and he set out to create 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.240
 a system where there will not be any children without patents 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.680
 she is a failure in year 25 teaching children with the method of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 read 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 and he proposed not to teach fethiye and not find a system where no 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260
 there will be no child without apparent 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.460
 me with this he called Luis 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.090
 thinking and that's how it has been over time 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.860
 this to make a light in the mind of the world 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.330
 since he started applying it in Mapuche communities 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.670
 recognized such one per course 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.510
 up to the present has not failed 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.420
 that is, he dedicated a talk 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 from talented children to children with mental retardation of the child with the syndrome 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.830
 down 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.440
 from children to adults is a practically infallible system 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.930
 very fast and is the only solution to ascend at this time 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.730
 in all that but america 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.100
 Adam Mynott of speaking disparate 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.200
 you did not see it as a demonstration in which you estimated before yesterday 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.560
 god a few minutes ago with children who had mental retardation 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.889
 i in 15 minutes were reading 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.919
 this is due to the fact that an ethical psychophony methodology will be applied 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.089
 didactic 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.609
 focused on the most common ways of learning from the human being 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.569
 the human being learns by invitation and by association of similarity 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.709
 the Portuguese system itself those two forms of teaching 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.469
 don delillo part 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.709
 d 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.979
 look at the concrete figure 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.419
 bm 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.680
 aguilar that the sounding can admire that figure 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.309
 that figure suggests a sound 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.789
 that coincides with the actual sound of the table for example 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.129
 the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.180
 before this forum 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.649
 the crying child 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.069
 and the child was asked how I was semi 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.989
 so he wanted 12 beers and since I was the owner 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.189
 that letter sounds 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.659
 also appeals 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.219
 now 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.219
 a series of ancestral knowledge 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 since man since the human being appeared the earth 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.909
 7 a ship of ancestral sounds 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.359
 i a bank of images 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.469
 there was no water when the earth appeared 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.769
 the human being captured to imitate sounds of nature 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.049
 and he began to draw his thought the system lusa own something formal 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:26.819
 as well 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.819
 and that explains the quick learning 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.790
 you as a social figure 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.019
 ohga from the year 2000 and is being applied across the country in more than 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.689
 400 children's izard inés schools operate in abuya 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.400
 and it works wonderfully for all kinds, as I say 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.260
 and it worked very fast 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.930
 the results that are obtained are percent very fast so that the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.029
 child without learning problems 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:55.529
 is already reading in two weeks 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.480
 Children with mild and moderate mental retardation can learn between three and 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.669
 four months and children with dawn syndrome between four to six months 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.139
 the same goes for adults adults learn very fast 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.740
 in this you have to put 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.619
 vocation but vocation 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.519
 at the service of children in speaking 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.279
 for that aduna strategies are taught as management techniques 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.279
 psychological action techniques public speaking techniques 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.229
 psychodrama techniques we are a depressive country 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.650
 and for 21st century children 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.650
 who are smarter than 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.629
 In case we did not have 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.490
 when we were that age 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.580
 these children in the classroom are delighted 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.110
 you have to seduce them through the word 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 therefore Professor Jiménez the histrionic 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.439
 If you want to achieve 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.239
 better and faster the press the rest does this methodology 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.880
 and as I say it works wonderful
