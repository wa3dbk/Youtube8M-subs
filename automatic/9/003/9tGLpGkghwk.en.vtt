00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
not that noticeable and you could

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050 
not that noticeable and you could
probably<00:01:47.790> skip<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.590> still<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.130> it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
towards my inner corner just creating a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:33.750 
towards my inner corner just creating a
nice<00:02:24.280> shape<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:31.739> next<00:02:32.739> I'm<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.310> take

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
nice shape there next I'm going to take

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.300 
nice shape there next I'm going to take
factory<00:02:34.600> which<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:35.950> bit<00:02:36.040> darker

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
factory which is a little bit darker

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.729 
factory which is a little bit darker
than<00:02:36.670> liar<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:37.959> i'm<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.349> really

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739

deepening<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.940> color<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:40.569> really

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
deepening up that color so really

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.160 
deepening up that color so really
focusing<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.090> outer<00:02:43.330> corner<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
then blending it towards the inner

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.330
