00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.200
 who accompanied são paulo fashion week 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 Maybe I did not even notice, but the hair on 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.130
 fundamental part of the look 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 and today more fashion will teach you to 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.720
 make the hair of the catwalks 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.980
 and everything that paulo made the minc so 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 different in hairstyle 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.970
 I think fashion week says fashion 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.790
 clothing also edits fashion hair and 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.489
 parallel between democracy that is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.540
 using that is more careless hair 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.550
 more natural 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.300
 This brings great joy. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.400
 consumer of a real woman who is 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.420
 translate this look from day to day more 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.180
 easily 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.570
 are more natural looks, simpler and 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.509
 with the polished finish that the products 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.880
 and finalization can give the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.640
 Godmothers to fill the buildings of brightness 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.710
 so I think that today's woman can 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 be happy because the looks of the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.630
 catwalk can be very similar to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.040

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.729
 trans the very minimal braid well 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.000
 simpler and in the end can 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.539

 take those freeze is a spray of 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.560
 shine fixation spray drier think 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.169
 that's welcome and I think it 's a 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.139
 contemporary that a lot of Brazilians will 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.780
 being able to use the beach is for an event 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.110
 more special even to go to work well 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.110
 cool 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.410
 today 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.300
 It's to end our conversation. 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.010
 any woman can have a hairstyle 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.320
 easy on a daily basis 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.620
 Look, I think the moment is super. 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.230
 and hairstyle are on the rise 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.690
 I used to work diesel in salon 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.120
 work with campaign with the commercial 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.100
 just that younger women but 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.260
 to find a hair stuck leaving the woman 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.230
 older and I think today is the 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.020
 I think the democratization of the 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.240
 style look okay for women 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.150
 make cups of air in braids 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.790
 I think the playful of stories comes a 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.850
 little real life and makes it 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.450
 possible that they wear stuck looks and 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.390
 invent fashion with ribbons with accessories 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:47.050
 use a lot of texturizer I think they 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.890
 can always be very beautiful in fashion and 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.890
 with amazing looks
