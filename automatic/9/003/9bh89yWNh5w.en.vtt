video<00:00:13.740> today<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:15.240> gotten<00:00:15.960> our

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
video today we have gotten our

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.280 
video today we have gotten our
sensitivities<00:00:19.670> numbering<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:21.290> advanced

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
sensitivities numbering for advanced

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.279 
sensitivities numbering for advanced
warfare<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.220> let's<00:00:23.490> take<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> look<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> call<00:00:24.510> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
warfare so let's take a look and call of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.390 
warfare so let's take a look and call of
duty<00:00:25.970> ghosts<00:00:26.970> there<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.600> 20<00:00:28.440> sensitivities

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
duty ghosts there was 20 sensitivities

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
duty ghosts there was 20 sensitivities
and<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.350> going<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.010> same<00:00:32.369> amount

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and that's going to be the same amount

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.450 
and that's going to be the same amount
as<00:00:36.410> there<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.660> call<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> duty<00:00:40.130> ghosts<00:00:41.130> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
as there was in call of duty ghosts so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.860 
as there was in call of duty ghosts so
there's<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.620> 20<00:00:44.870> sensitivity

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
there's going to be 20 sensitivity

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.760 
there's going to be 20 sensitivity
numbers<00:00:46.290> in<00:00:46.940> advanced<00:00:47.940> warfare<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:49.469> what

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
numbers in advanced warfare that's what

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.209 
numbers in advanced warfare that's what
it<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.440> pre-release<00:00:52.440> game<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
it was like in the pre-release game and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.910 
it was like in the pre-release game and
that's<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> final

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that's what it will be like in the final

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
that's what it will be like in the final
build<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:57.000> game<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:59.489> personally

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
build of this game and I personally

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.570 
build of this game and I personally
played<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:01.520> number<00:01:02.520> six<00:01:03.289> blatt<00:01:04.289> a<00:01:04.619> number<00:01:05.129> four

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
played on number six blatt a number four

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
played on number six blatt a number four
on<00:01:06.740> call<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> duty<00:01:08.220> ghosts<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.619> year<00:01:11.190> i

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
on call of duty ghosts but this year i

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.050 
on call of duty ghosts but this year i
think<00:01:11.369> i'm<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.030> bump<00:01:12.899> it<00:01:13.050> up<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.759> six<00:01:14.759> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
think i'm going to bump it up to six and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
think i'm going to bump it up to six and
i'll<00:01:15.270> explain<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> why<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:18.530> use<00:01:19.530> these

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
i'll explain to you why I use these

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.889 
i'll explain to you why I use these
little<00:01:20.970> controller<00:01:21.840> add-ons<00:01:22.759> they're<00:01:23.899> almost

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
little controller add-ons they're almost

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.930 
little controller add-ons they're almost
just<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.039> control<00:01:26.849> freaks<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.130> did<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
just like control freaks but it did a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.400 
just like control freaks but it did a
little<00:01:30.599> bit<00:01:31.020> different<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.399> smaller

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
little bit different do a little smaller

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.710 
little bit different do a little smaller
the<00:01:34.410> little<00:01:34.860> cheaper<00:01:35.399> these<00:01:35.700> were<00:01:35.940> like<00:01:36.209> five

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the little cheaper these were like five

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.120 
the little cheaper these were like five
bucks<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.060> control<00:01:39.060> freaks<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:40.970> 14<00:01:41.970> bucks

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
bucks the control freaks are 14 bucks

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.070 
bucks the control freaks are 14 bucks
which<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.670> cheap<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.360> definitely

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going to be picking up a pair of control

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.680 
going to be picking up a pair of control
freaks<00:02:00.720> but<00:02:01.530> um<00:02:01.800> I<00:02:02.330> just<00:02:03.330> want<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:05.539> let<00:02:06.539> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
freaks but um I just want to let you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.199 
freaks but um I just want to let you
know<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:10.069> ghosts<00:02:11.069> was<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> pretty

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
know that if like ghosts was a pretty

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.410 
know that if like ghosts was a pretty
slow<00:02:12.810> action<00:02:13.440> based<00:02:14.250> game<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.120> maps

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
slow action based game like the maps

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.480 
slow action based game like the maps
were<00:02:15.750> huge<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.810> game<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.079> that<00:02:19.379> game<00:02:19.620> so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
were huge in this game in that game so

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.560 
were huge in this game in that game so
and<00:02:22.000> an<00:02:22.690> advanced<00:02:23.440> warfare<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.940> maps<00:02:25.240> are

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
and an advanced warfare the maps are

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.710 
and an advanced warfare the maps are
smaller<00:02:26.140> compared<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.580> call<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.270> duty

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
smaller compared to like call of duty

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.430 
smaller compared to like call of duty
black<00:02:28.870> ops<00:02:29.200> 2<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.360> action<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.290> be

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
black ops 2 so the action is going to be

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.910 
black ops 2 so the action is going to be
a<00:02:32.470> little<00:02:32.800> more<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.370> your<00:02:33.790> face<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:35.710> all

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
a little more in your face and with all

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.080 
a little more in your face and with all
the<00:02:36.220> excitability<00:02:36.870> movements<00:02:38.640> you're<00:02:39.640> going

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the excitability movements you're going

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.990 
the excitability movements you're going
to<00:02:40.210> want<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:42.190> looking<00:02:42.460> around<00:02:42.580> up<00:02:42.910> in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
to want to like be looking around up in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.530 
to want to like be looking around up in
here<00:02:43.170> pretty<00:02:44.170> much<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.710> at<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> time<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
here pretty much all at a time as on the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
here pretty much all at a time as on the
ground<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.810> doing<00:02:50.020> in

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
ground so well I'm going to be doing in

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.830 
ground so well I'm going to be doing in
advance<00:02:51.430> for<00:02:51.580> first<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.690> be

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
advance for first I'm going to be

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.510 
advance for first I'm going to be
bumping<00:02:53.530> my<00:02:53.950> sensitivity<00:02:54.880> up<00:02:55.380> into<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.100> six

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
bumping my sensitivity up into up to six

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.050 
bumping my sensitivity up into up to six
and<00:02:58.380> maybe<00:02:59.380> if<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.010> get<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> little<00:03:00.940> more

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
and maybe if I get a little more

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.960 
and maybe if I get a little more
comfortable<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.020> can<00:03:02.200> start<00:03:02.440> bumping<00:03:03.430> up

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
comfortable then I can start bumping up
