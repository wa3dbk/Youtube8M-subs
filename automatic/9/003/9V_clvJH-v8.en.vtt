00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it needs to be kept high throughout the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
it needs to be kept high throughout the
growing<00:01:52.829> season<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.850> bring<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
growing season you can bring it down a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
growing season you can bring it down a
little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> fall<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.680> from<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
little bit in the fall but from the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
little bit in the fall but from the
first<00:01:56.159> moment<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.600> should<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> high

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
first moment on you should have it high

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
first moment on you should have it high
now<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> south<00:02:00.090> where<00:02:00.420> we

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
now we get down to the south where we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.819 
now we get down to the south where we
have<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:00.899> other<00:02:01.110> types<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.590> grasses

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
have some other types of grasses

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
have some other types of grasses
probably<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.790> only<00:02:02.909> grass<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.689> should

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
probably the only grass it really should

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
probably the only grass it really should
be<00:02:03.899> mowed<00:02:04.229> short<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.850> Bermuda<00:02:05.850> grass<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.240> can

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
be mowed short is Bermuda grass that can

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.059 
be mowed short is Bermuda grass that can
be<00:02:06.570> cut<00:02:06.780> down<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.350> an<00:02:07.469> inch<00:02:07.619> inch<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
be cut down at about an inch inch and a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.270 
be cut down at about an inch inch and a
half

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
half

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.360 
half
zoycha<00:02:09.539> maybe<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.170> inches<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.250> get

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
zoycha maybe two inches but when you get

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
zoycha maybe two inches but when you get
to<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> centipede<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> st.<00:02:12.540> Augustine

grasses

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
grasses
again<00:02:14.070> those<00:02:14.460> should<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.730> mowed<00:02:15.030> higher<00:02:15.270> they

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
again those should be mowed higher they

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
again those should be mowed higher they
will<00:02:16.020> do<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> lot<00:02:16.320> better<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:17.610> talk

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
will do a lot better now let's talk

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.700 
will do a lot better now let's talk
about<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> reasons<00:02:18.630> why<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.260> want<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> mow

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
about the reasons why we want to mow

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.800 
about the reasons why we want to mow
them<00:02:19.920> high<00:02:20.100> well<00:02:20.970> think<00:02:21.210> about<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.600> grass

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
them high well think about the grass

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.470 
them high well think about the grass
blade<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.890> green<00:02:23.250> part<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.760> plant<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.300> up

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
blade the green part of that plant is up

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.020 
blade the green part of that plant is up
at<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.690> top<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.070> want<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.490> leave<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.820> much

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
at the top so you want to leave as much

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.420 
at the top so you want to leave as much
of<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.240> leaf<00:02:27.540> surface<00:02:28.020> available<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
of that leaf surface available for the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730 
of that leaf surface available for the
plant<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.600> through<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.990> photosynthetic

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
plant to go through the photosynthetic

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.100 
plant to go through the photosynthetic
process<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:33.000> where<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.360> produces<00:02:33.870> food

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
process that's where it produces food

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.350 
process that's where it produces food
the<00:02:34.680> sunlight<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.460> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> grass<00:02:36.060> blade

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the sunlight going into the grass blade

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.630 
the sunlight going into the grass blade
you<00:02:36.690> cut<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.050> short<00:02:37.380> there's<00:02:37.830> less<00:02:38.040> potential

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you cut it short there's less potential

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.240 
you cut it short there's less potential
for<00:02:38.790> food<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.810> by<00:02:40.050> having<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.680> plenty<00:02:40.950> high

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
for food so by having that plenty high

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
for food so by having that plenty high
you'll<00:02:41.700> get<00:02:41.880> plenty<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.240> sunlight<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
you'll get plenty of sunlight and the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
you'll get plenty of sunlight and the
plant<00:02:43.380> will<00:02:43.500> produce<00:02:43.530> lots<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.190> food<00:02:44.420> another

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
plant will produce lots of food another

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.240 
plant will produce lots of food another
good<00:02:45.690> reason<00:02:45.900> why<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.440> longer<00:02:47.010> grass

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
good reason why is that longer grass

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.740 
good reason why is that longer grass
blade<00:02:47.580> will<00:02:47.760> shade<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.060> ground<00:02:48.240> underneath

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
blade will shade the ground underneath

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.270 
blade will shade the ground underneath
and<00:02:49.290> therefore<00:02:49.710> you're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.010> keep<00:02:50.130> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and therefore you're going to keep it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
and therefore you're going to keep it
cooler<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.050> stay<00:02:52.260> moist

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
cooler and then it's going to stay moist

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.100 
cooler and then it's going to stay moist
for<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> longer<00:02:53.250> period<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.700> time<00:02:54.110> therefore

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
for a longer period of time therefore

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.260 
for a longer period of time therefore
you<00:02:55.470> don't<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> water<00:02:56.400> as<00:02:56.700> often<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
you don't have to water as often and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.810 
you don't have to water as often and
that's<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.600> good<00:02:57.780> thing<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.860> other<00:02:59.130> really

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that's a good thing now the other really

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.640 
that's a good thing now the other really
good<00:03:00.150> reason<00:03:00.540> why<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.720> want<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> mow<00:03:01.230> high<00:03:01.410> is

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
good reason why you want to mow high is

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.330 
good reason why you want to mow high is
it's<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.220> great<00:03:02.550> way<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.850> control<00:03:03.330> weeds<00:03:04.280> by<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it's a great way to control weeds by the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.580 
it's a great way to control weeds by the
longer<00:03:06.120> grass<00:03:06.300> play<00:03:06.570> by<00:03:06.780> shading<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.320> ground

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
longer grass play by shading the ground

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.530 
longer grass play by shading the ground
underneath<00:03:07.980> will<00:03:08.640> keep<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.090> Sun<00:03:09.330> from

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
underneath will keep that Sun from

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.570 
underneath will keep that Sun from
hitting<00:03:09.870> down<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.140> those<00:03:10.290> weed<00:03:10.950> seeds<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
hitting down to those weed seeds and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.120 
hitting down to those weed seeds and
causing<00:03:12.390> them<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.660> germinate<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.950> want

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
causing them to germinate so if you want

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
causing them to germinate so if you want
to<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.700> keep<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.180> weeds<00:03:15.420> under<00:03:15.720> control

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
to really keep your weeds under control

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.190 
to really keep your weeds under control
mow<00:03:16.770> your<00:03:16.980> grass<00:03:17.040> high<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.970> course<00:03:18.840> through

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
mow your grass high of course through

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.740 
mow your grass high of course through
the<00:03:20.160> normal<00:03:20.550> process<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.270> mowing<00:03:21.570> you're

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the normal process of mowing you're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.240 
the normal process of mowing you're
going<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> few<00:03:22.410> weeds<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.100> will

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
going to get a few weeds but you will

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.340 
going to get a few weeds but you will
have<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> lot<00:03:23.700> less<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.750> keep<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.170> mowed

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
have a lot less if you keep it mowed

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.160 
have a lot less if you keep it mowed
high<00:03:25.590> now<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.520> show<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.150> will<00:03:28.140> happen

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
high now to show you what will happen

sprinkler system goes off automatically

you<00:04:05.940> don't<00:04:06.120> have<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.360> worry<00:04:06.570> about<00:04:06.660> it

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
you don't have to worry about it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.710 
you don't have to worry about it
unfortunately<00:04:08.280> most<00:04:08.610> people<00:04:08.790> don't<00:04:09.300> have<00:04:09.570> it

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
unfortunately most people don't have it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.800 
unfortunately most people don't have it
set<00:04:09.989> properly<00:04:10.530> meaning<00:04:10.950> they<00:04:11.670> are<00:04:11.880> watering

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
set properly meaning they are watering

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.530 
set properly meaning they are watering
it<00:04:12.930> maybe<00:04:13.140> 10<00:04:13.530> minutes<00:04:13.770> per<00:04:14.190> zone<00:04:14.520> per<00:04:15.270> day

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it maybe 10 minutes per zone per day

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.590 
it maybe 10 minutes per zone per day
that's<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:16.859> enough<00:04:17.220> water<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.760> a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that's really not enough water in a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.409 
that's really not enough water in a
daily<00:04:18.959> basis<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.620> really<00:04:19.799> help<00:04:20.160> improve

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
daily basis to really help improve

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.090 
daily basis to really help improve

where all of your roots are going to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.920 
where all of your roots are going to
grow<00:04:28.860> we<00:04:29.370> would<00:04:29.580> rather<00:04:29.759> have<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.270> water<00:04:30.539> once

or<00:04:31.169> twice<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.439> week<00:04:31.650> water<00:04:32.490> deeply<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.479> the

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
or twice a week water deeply so the

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.779 
or twice a week water deeply so the
roots<00:04:33.870> will<00:04:34.110> go<00:04:34.289> down<00:04:34.319> deeper<00:04:35.129> into<00:04:35.159> the<00:04:35.550> soil

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
roots will go down deeper into the soil

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.899 
roots will go down deeper into the soil
to<00:04:36.389> get<00:04:36.569> that<00:04:36.840> water<00:04:37.319> if<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.009> mow<00:04:38.250> constantly

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
to get that water if you mow constantly

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.790 
to get that water if you mow constantly
water<00:04:39.180> at<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.509> top<00:04:39.689> you're<00:04:40.379> going<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> have

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
water at the top you're going to have

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.709 
water at the top you're going to have
roots<00:04:41.099> that<00:04:41.250> are<00:04:41.400> at<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.669> top<00:04:41.879> so<00:04:42.569> we

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
roots that are at the top so we

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.990 
roots that are at the top so we
recommend<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.919> cut<00:04:44.490> back<00:04:44.729> your

minutes<00:04:50.250> per<00:04:50.520> zone<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:51.270> will<00:04:51.419> have<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:51.750> adjust

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
minutes per zone you will have to adjust

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.260 
minutes per zone you will have to adjust
it<00:04:52.259> with<00:04:52.469> your<00:04:52.710> sprinkler<00:04:53.129> system<00:04:53.159> company<00:04:53.819> to
