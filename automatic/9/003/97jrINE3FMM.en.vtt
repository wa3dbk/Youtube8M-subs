00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
a single file so the file I'm going to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
a single file so the file I'm going to
use<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> landscape

from Reb Croatia so I took it in the raw
format<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.480> necessary<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> use<00:00:19.289> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
format which is necessary to use this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.189 
format which is necessary to use this
technique<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.820> bring<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.510> Photoshop

just drag and drop it now to create the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
just drag and drop it now to create the
HDR<00:00:26.310> image<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.820> want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.869> different

first<00:01:45.479> step<00:01:45.659> I'm<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> create<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
first step I'm just going to create a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.990 
first step I'm just going to create a
gradient<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:49.020> over<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> gradient<00:01:49.530> tool

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
gradient so go over to the gradient tool

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.310 
gradient so go over to the gradient tool
make<00:01:51.000> sure<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> white<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.810> black<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
make sure you have white and black you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
make sure you have white and black you
can<00:01:52.470> press<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> D<00:01:52.950> button<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
can press the D button or this here to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
can press the D button or this here to
select<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> defaults<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.820> make<00:01:57.360> sure

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
select the defaults and then make sure

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.760 
select the defaults and then make sure
you're<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.290> foreground

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you're on this here foreground

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.660 
you're on this here foreground
background<00:01:59.189> in<00:02:00.090> gradient<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.460> you're<00:02:02.460> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
background in gradient and you're just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.119 
background in gradient and you're just
regular<00:02:03.270> line<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.860> then<00:02:05.719> draw<00:02:06.719> your<00:02:06.750> gradient

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
regular line and then draw your gradient

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.330 
regular line and then draw your gradient
the<00:02:08.129> right<00:02:08.310> direction<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the right direction and you can see the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.059 
the right direction and you can see the
two<00:02:11.520> blended<00:02:11.879> images

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
two blended images

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.800 
two blended images
now<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.610> some<00:02:13.819> sort<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.090> problems<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.569> here

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
now I have some sort of problems up here

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.220 
now I have some sort of problems up here
which<00:02:15.049> I'll<00:02:15.349> correct<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.159> patch<00:02:16.400> tool

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
which I'll correct with the patch tool

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.360 
which I'll correct with the patch tool
you'll<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.439> check<00:02:18.620> out<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.799> tutorial<00:02:19.159> on

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you'll have to check out a tutorial on

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.470 
you'll have to check out a tutorial on
that<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:19.760> you're<00:02:20.000> not<00:02:20.480> sure<00:02:20.629> how<00:02:20.719> they<00:02:20.870> work

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that if you're not sure how they work

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.740 
that if you're not sure how they work
all<00:02:23.480> right

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
all right

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.580 
all right
and<00:02:24.280> now<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.450> layers<00:02:27.019> individually

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and now to just the layers individually

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.729 
and now to just the layers individually
with<00:02:27.739> curves<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.879> create<00:02:29.120> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
with curves I'm going to create a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.130 
with curves I'm going to create a
adjustment<00:02:30.739> layer<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.069> curves<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:32.079> now<00:02:33.079> to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
adjustment layer of curves and now to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.490 
adjustment layer of curves and now to
make<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.409> only<00:02:33.859> affect<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.849> layer<00:02:35.329> below<00:02:35.569> now

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
make it only affect this layer below now

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.110 
make it only affect this layer below now
first<00:02:36.920> I'll<00:02:37.069> show<00:02:37.099> you<00:02:37.250> right<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:37.790> if<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:37.970> make

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
first I'll show you right now if I make

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.899 
first I'll show you right now if I make
an<00:02:38.239> adjustment<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:39.670> affect<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> whole

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
an adjustment it will affect the whole

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.280 
an adjustment it will affect the whole
image<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.349> press<00:02:42.739> this<00:02:42.889> here<00:02:44.049> link<00:02:45.049> down

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
image but if I press this here link down

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.369 
image but if I press this here link down
get<00:02:45.889> a<00:02:45.920> link<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.180> layer<00:02:47.269> below<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.810> now<00:02:48.319> it

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
get a link to the layer below and now it

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.770 
get a link to the layer below and now it
will<00:02:48.560> only<00:02:48.709> affect<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.129> sky<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.700> that's<00:02:50.629> what

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
will only affect the sky so that's what

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.839 
will only affect the sky so that's what
I<00:02:50.810> want<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.109> do<00:02:51.200> I'll<00:02:51.769> pull<00:02:52.310> up<00:02:52.340> my<00:02:52.519> highlights

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
I want to do I'll pull up my highlights

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.069 
I want to do I'll pull up my highlights
a<00:02:52.970> bit<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:54.260> create<00:02:54.799> some<00:02:55.010> good<00:02:55.189> contrast<00:02:55.700> and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
a bit and create some good contrast and

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.550 
a bit and create some good contrast and
then<00:02:58.180> I'll<00:02:59.180> make<00:02:59.450> another<00:02:59.720> curves<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:00.290> for

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
then I'll make another curves there for

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.020 
then I'll make another curves there for
the<00:03:00.799> bottom<00:03:01.639> area<00:03:02.169> and<00:03:03.169> now<00:03:04.159> I've<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.519> done<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
the bottom area and now I've just done a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.879 
the bottom area and now I've just done a
gradient<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.900> merge<00:03:06.439> these<00:03:06.680> two<00:03:06.859> layers

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
gradient to merge these two layers

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.720 
gradient to merge these two layers
together<00:03:07.419> but<00:03:08.419> if<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.629> want<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> go<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.079> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
together but if you want to go in and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.479 
together but if you want to go in and
brush<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.209> layer<00:03:11.359> mask<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.840> can<00:03:12.019> and

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
brush on the layer mask you can and

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.039 
brush on the layer mask you can and
bring<00:03:13.489> out<00:03:13.609> some<00:03:13.879> more<00:03:13.909> highlights<00:03:14.659> in

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
bring out some more highlights in

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.920 
bring out some more highlights in
specific<00:03:15.739> areas<00:03:15.919> of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.579> image<00:03:16.819> if<00:03:17.750> you're

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
specific areas of the image if you're

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.599 
specific areas of the image if you're
not<00:03:18.079> sure<00:03:18.229> how<00:03:18.379> layer<00:03:18.739> masks<00:03:19.129> work<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.489> can

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
not sure how layer masks work you can

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.659 
not sure how layer masks work you can
check<00:03:19.639> out<00:03:19.909> a<00:03:20.180> tutorial<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:21.019> those<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:22.519> you

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
check out a tutorial on those but if you

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.430 
check out a tutorial on those but if you
paint<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.659> few<00:03:23.840> specific<00:03:23.989> areas<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.769> your<00:03:26.440> layer

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
paint a few specific areas in your layer

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.680 
paint a few specific areas in your layer
mask<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.889> can<00:03:28.099> create<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.400> nice<00:03:28.639> effect<00:03:29.120> and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
mask you can create a nice effect and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.330 
mask you can create a nice effect and
finish<00:03:30.409> things<00:03:30.500> off<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:30.919> I'm<00:03:31.099> going<00:03:31.280> to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
finish things off here I'm going to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.619 
finish things off here I'm going to
create<00:03:31.669> a<00:03:31.879> little<00:03:32.780> bit<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.440> vignette<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
create a little bit of a vignette and

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.659 
create a little bit of a vignette and
maybe<00:03:38.629> I'll<00:03:38.840> bring<00:03:39.769> out<00:03:39.889> this<00:03:40.099> edge<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> little

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
maybe I'll bring out this edge a little

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.050 
maybe I'll bring out this edge a little
bit<00:03:40.790> more<00:03:41.030> too<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:43.340> little<00:03:43.549> more<00:03:43.639> contrast

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
bit more too and a little more contrast

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:54.100 
bit more too and a little more contrast
in<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.299> water<00:03:44.510> perhaps

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110
