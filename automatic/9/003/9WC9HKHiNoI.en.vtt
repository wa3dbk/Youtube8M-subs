realistically if somebody broke up with
you<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.069> chances<00:03:01.609> are<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:02.180> didn't<00:03:02.540> think

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
you the chances are they didn't think

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.930 
you the chances are they didn't think
that<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.170> were<00:03:03.319> good<00:03:03.470> enough<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:04.220> them<00:03:04.549> so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that you were good enough for them so

just stop you're hurting my feelings
another<00:03:08.780> thing<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.079> always<00:03:09.260> fear<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.950> he'll

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
another thing I always fear is he'll

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.259 
another thing I always fear is he'll
come<00:03:10.760> along<00:03:11.060> when<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.989> stop<00:03:12.410> looking<00:03:13.269> that's

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
come along when you stop looking that's

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.740 
come along when you stop looking that's
just<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.690> really<00:03:15.139> play<00:03:15.440> way<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.889> saying<00:03:16.160> oh<00:03:16.750> you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
just a really play way of saying oh you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.449 
just a really play way of saying oh you
might<00:03:17.930> want<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> sit<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.859> out<00:03:18.920> sweetie

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
might want to sit this one out sweetie

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.250 
might want to sit this one out sweetie
that<00:03:19.850> gets<00:03:20.060> really<00:03:20.450> confusing<00:03:20.600> especially

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
that gets really confusing especially

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.080 
that gets really confusing especially
because<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.160> other<00:03:22.400> half<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.940> population

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
because the other half of the population

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
because the other half of the population
is<00:03:23.660> telling<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.350> got<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.859> get<00:03:25.010> out<00:03:25.130> there
