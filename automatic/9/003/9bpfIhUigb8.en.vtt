sitting at 12 8 currently to simulate my
solar<00:00:43.469> panel<00:00:43.980> i'm<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.350> variable<00:00:46.520> charger

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
solar panel i'm using a variable charger

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330 
solar panel i'm using a variable charger
it's<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.379> allows<00:00:49.379> me<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> adjust<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's actually a allows me to adjust the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's actually a allows me to adjust the
current<00:00:50.760> flow<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> half<00:00:51.899> an<00:00:52.079> amp

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
current flow up to about a half an amp

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.000 
current flow up to about a half an amp
and<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.940> i<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> voltmeter<00:00:55.010> showing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and then i have a voltmeter showing

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
and then i have a voltmeter showing
what's<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> charge<00:00:58.620> controller

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
what's going in to the charge controller

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
what's going in to the charge controller
so<00:00:59.579> let<00:00:59.730> me<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.559> dialed<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:02.329> until

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
so let me just get this dialed up until

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.910 
so let me just get this dialed up until
we<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:05.119> let's<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.920> routine

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we get up to let's say about the routine

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.180 
we get up to let's say about the routine
bolts<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:10.549> now<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> look

is sitting at 12 85 and climbing I'll
buy<00:01:28.610> increase<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.330> current<00:01:29.660> here<00:01:30.940> quite<00:01:31.940> a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
buy increase the current here quite a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.910 
buy increase the current here quite a
bit<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.450> maybe<00:01:33.610> 400<00:01:34.610> milliamps<00:01:35.080> oops<00:01:36.080> looks

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
bit to maybe 400 milliamps oops looks

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.100 
bit to maybe 400 milliamps oops looks
like<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.280> already<00:01:37.670> popped<00:01:38.150> over<00:01:40.930> we're<00:01:41.930> still

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
like it already popped over we're still

like it already popped over we're still
charging<00:01:42.710> i<00:01:42.920> meant<00:01:44.440> 200<00:01:45.440> million<00:01:45.620> charge<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
charging i meant 200 million charge and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.640 
charging i meant 200 million charge and
just<00:01:46.550> did<00:01:46.730> 10<00:01:46.940> what<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:48.050> do<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.320> here<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.560> can

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
just did 10 what we do it here you can

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.320 
just did 10 what we do it here you can
see<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> voltage<00:01:49.120> climbing<00:01:50.470> 13<00:01:51.470> 5<00:01:51.650> minutes

batteries<00:01:57.020> actually<00:01:57.320> pretty<00:01:57.500> full<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.490> have

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
batteries actually pretty full so I have

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.300 
batteries actually pretty full so I have
it<00:01:59.210> set<00:01:59.360> up<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.570> it'll<00:01:59.840> flip<00:02:00.080> over<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.380> fully

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
it set up so it'll flip over to fully

designed around 14 volts on the battery

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.220 
designed around 14 volts on the battery
so<00:02:07.940> we're<00:02:08.090> at<00:02:08.179> sitting<00:02:08.540> at<00:02:09.160> 1385<00:02:11.050> there<00:02:12.050> goes

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
so we're at sitting at 1385 there goes

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.860 
so we're at sitting at 1385 there goes
just<00:02:12.710> flipped<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.910> 13<00:02:14.620> 85<00:02:15.620> or<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.660> drops<00:02:17.660> down

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
just flipped at 13 85 or so drops down

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.560 
just flipped at 13 85 or so drops down
the<00:02:18.110> car<00:02:18.290> charge<00:02:18.650> current<00:02:19.040> because<00:02:19.760> no<00:02:20.209> longer

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
the car charge current because no longer

drawing from the so-called solar panel

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.949 
drawing from the so-called solar panel
anymore<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:25.670> drops<00:02:25.970> off<00:02:26.150> my<00:02:26.390> panel

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
anymore and that drops off my panel

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.949 
anymore and that drops off my panel
voltage<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:29.180> anyway<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:31.340> works<00:02:31.550> pretty<00:02:31.760> well

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
