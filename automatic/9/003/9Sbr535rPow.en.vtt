00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.639
 me is quentin so here is first gm 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 nf in this training it was mostly 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.490
 being in touch with the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.859
 nature 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.869
 understand how the how 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 maintain it I've always loved the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 nature so I really wanted to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.130
 start in this training to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.050
 learn more 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.050
 I like it enormously enormously 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 there for example to go to the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.050
 rehabilitate a little bit the cascade of the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 coup we sign to several we made a 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 small retention basin on side a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 little phase she had dug the seat 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 of the tale is therefore laid foundations and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.300
 so there after laying the boards or 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 but a top dressing for waste 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 old and internet see an anti 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:02.879
 slip on the ground to cooperate with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.909
 to use for me I did not have too much 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.100
 the cottages boss of the trail what me 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 I am more ground we learn to manage 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.479
 natural space like forest or low 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 wetlands like here we have 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 general subjects such as French 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.030
 maths history 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.040
 English and then we have materials 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 professionals like biology and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.570
 techno pro to enter here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.240
 a request already then after 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.780
 studied by our file we spend a 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.850
 interview and during the interview he sees 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 our personality especially our envy 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.390
 as well 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:49.430
 and therefore after judge on his information 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.009
 a little wildlife management we did 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.200
 the birds made the reptiles the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.360
 insects because insects are the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.050
 basis of everything in fact 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.050
 this training can open either to the water 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.600
 nf one keeps forest guard of river 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.509
 gamekeeper art and prospect the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.869
 profits are much more interested in 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.270
 made 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.280
 or finally he looks after a lot more 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.220
 many compared to third where 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.440
 French high class teachers and he has 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.970
 no individuality what are we trying 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 to develop more and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.989
 availability and from the moment 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.700
 the other young people without us being 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.040
 available to help them work 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.750
 to teach them things 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 they are much more listened to more 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.590
 receptive in fact we have a lot of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.659
 young people who continue their studies in 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.900
 senior technician certificate is in 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.340
 professional license and who are going 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.109
 then be restarted to resume a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.109
 schooling costs more rewarding
