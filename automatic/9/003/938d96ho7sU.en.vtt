now<00:01:37.990> we're<00:01:38.440> coming<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.830> fork<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.340> road<00:01:39.610> I

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
now we're coming to a fork in the road I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.810 
now we're coming to a fork in the road I
think<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.690> know<00:01:40.840> which<00:01:41.020> way<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.229> go

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
think you know which way to go

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
hope I showed you that engineering can

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.680 
hope I showed you that engineering can
be<00:02:50.210> fun<00:02:50.450> now<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:51.770> you'll<00:02:51.950> excuse<00:02:52.340> me<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.690> just
