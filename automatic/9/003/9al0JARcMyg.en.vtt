really sort of bringing that in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
really sort of bringing that in
discussing<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.270> both<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.960> those

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
discussing that with both with those

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
discussing that with both with those
teams<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.010> closely<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.149> sort<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
teams really really closely to sort of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.580 
teams really really closely to sort of
really<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.140> could<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
really see how we could make a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.069 
really see how we could make a
difference<00:00:50.090> it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.300> sort<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> became

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
difference it was sort of became

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
difference it was sort of became
apparent<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> back<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> January<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> guess

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
apparent sort of back in January I guess

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
apparent sort of back in January I guess
that<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:55.350> knew<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:55.770> something

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that we knew we had something

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
that we knew we had something
potentially<00:00:56.699> quite<00:00:57.120> special<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
potentially quite special with the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
potentially quite special with the
camera<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.469> felt<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.920> hadn't<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.510> we

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
camera but we felt that we hadn't we we

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
camera but we felt that we hadn't we we
haven't<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.170> used<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> its<00:01:01.980> full

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
haven't really used it to its full

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
haven't really used it to its full
potential<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.300> actually<00:01:03.750> wipe<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> slate

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
potential so we actually wipe the slate

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
potential so we actually wipe the slate
clean<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> point<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.240> we

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
clean at that point pretty much and we

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.410 
clean at that point pretty much and we
started<00:01:06.750> again<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:08.250> went<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.180> point

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
started again and we went to this point

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
started again and we went to this point
where<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.830> wanted<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> create<00:01:11.430> something

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
where we wanted to create something

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
where we wanted to create something
really<00:01:11.880> natural<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> images<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
really natural with the images a lot of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
really natural with the images a lot of
the<00:01:13.680> pictures<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> sort

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the pictures that you see with the sort

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
the pictures that you see with the sort
of<00:01:15.299> mobile<00:01:15.630> phones<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> sort<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
of mobile phones have this sort of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
of mobile phones have this sort of
digital<00:01:17.400> look<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.759> them

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
digital look to them

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.239 
digital look to them
artificially<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.140> heart<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:20.469> that<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.890> colors

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
artificially in heart so that the colors

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.999 
artificially in heart so that the colors
are<00:01:21.399> over<00:01:21.609> saturated<00:01:22.359> or<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:23.140> see<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.590> teen<00:01:23.799> has

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
are over saturated or you see a teen has

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.590 
are over saturated or you see a teen has
and<00:01:24.340> we<00:01:24.429> see<00:01:24.609> these<00:01:24.729> black<00:01:24.969> and<00:01:25.179> white<00:01:25.299> lines

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
and we see these black and white lines

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.410 
and we see these black and white lines
drawn<00:01:26.049> around<00:01:26.350> areas<00:01:26.859> of<00:01:27.039> contrast<00:01:27.549> we<00:01:28.240> didn't

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
drawn around areas of contrast we didn't

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.990 
drawn around areas of contrast we didn't
want<00:01:28.569> to<00:01:28.600> do<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.990> anymore<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:30.130> we<00:01:30.700> took<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
want to do that anymore so we took the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.639 
want to do that anymore so we took the
great<00:01:31.179> optics<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.750> we<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.200> coals<00:01:32.409> ice

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
great optics that we have the coals ice

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.340 
great optics that we have the coals ice
optics<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.549> this<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.939> large<00:01:34.240> sensor<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
optics and this really large sensor the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.779 
optics and this really large sensor the
biggest<00:01:35.649> sensor<00:01:35.979> that's<00:01:36.039> ever<00:01:36.250> been<00:01:36.429> put<00:01:36.640> into

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
biggest sensor that's ever been put into

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.510 
biggest sensor that's ever been put into
a<00:01:36.909> mobile<00:01:37.390> put<00:01:38.109> those<00:01:38.259> two<00:01:38.530> together<00:01:38.709> and<00:01:39.189> that

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
a mobile put those two together and that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.399 
a mobile put those two together and that
gave<00:01:39.729> us<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.030> best<00:01:40.240> platform<00:01:40.810> ever<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.259> make

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
gave us the best platform ever to make

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.139 
gave us the best platform ever to make
these<00:01:41.619> really<00:01:41.890> beautiful<00:01:42.159> natural<00:01:42.789> images

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
these really beautiful natural images

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.389 
these really beautiful natural images
that's<00:01:44.109> that's<00:01:44.799> what<00:01:44.950> we've<00:01:45.099> been<00:01:45.219> doing

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
that's that's what we've been doing

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.940 
that's that's what we've been doing
being<00:01:45.969> pretty<00:01:46.119> busy<00:01:46.450> with<00:01:46.539> that<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:47.709> feel

really proud of what would being able to
achieve<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.410> back<00:02:20.560> sort<00:02:20.769> of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829

five years ago where the sort of camera
performance<00:02:24.579> was<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.030> stage<00:02:25.359> there<00:02:25.900> was

green<00:02:45.739> one<00:02:45.770> with<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.340> I'm<00:02:46.730> torn<00:02:47.090> between<00:02:47.270> of

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
green one with me I'm torn between of

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
think probably the blue but the Queen's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.870 
think probably the blue but the Queen's
pretty<00:02:53.330> distinctive
