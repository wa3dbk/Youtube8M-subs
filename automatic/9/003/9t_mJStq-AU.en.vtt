00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.280

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.500
 and gum is gum with 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 I am on the wrong side 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.950
 a strip width of 3 and a half centimeters 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.430
 just fold it in half 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.040
 inserting there kraykom 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:36.670
 need to turn over stretch this one a little 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.670
 gum rather this knitwear gum 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.790
 and on the flat car all this 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.290
 threaded string is obtained 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.210
 with flooring 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.710
 just going through this seam 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 we have a better face 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.040
 wrong side 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.260
 This is an ordinary children's t-shirt 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.550
 just tailored without even a pattern 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.360
 just right on the fabric 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 and we have such a summer one 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.750
 suit with passive gaspra jami 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.750
 short pants 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 this is a promo 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.290
 rather neck in children's clothes for 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.870
 she turn over in the open cut first 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.520
 sewn one shoulder seam here it is then I 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.150
 neck edging 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.510
 and then I sew up 2 shoulders I drive for 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.240
 Now we add acanthus shaft and I will 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.250
 turn over at once 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 the second troome and where is it already sewn when 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:54.710
 something such a children's shirt 26 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710
 notch 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.360
 here it is 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.190
 I combine the edging so that it is exactly on 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.190
 shelf and back 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.660
 places of what 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:34.580
 shoulder seam 1 and 2 football 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.240
 so here all the seams should match 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.310
 Canto door you armhole where we 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.310
 now downloaded shoulder seam 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.300
 so here's the question 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.520
 let us grind off the side seams 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.520
 the edges 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:29.280
 grind on the back set 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.640
 limiter to even hem down 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.830
 my side seams are ready to hem 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:42.240
 not a bunny and leaving the same line 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.240
 so the side seams I lay aside 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.240
 backrest 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.890
 Sudan 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.739
 bend down 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.739
 two and a half centimeters 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:09.209
 and tailoring here see the limiter below 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:14.849
 there it stands it does not give an attempt to go left 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.950
 per line so we always have a hem 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.579
 goes along the line and line and rolls 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.989
 closes looking exactly finite edging 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.820
 also need to put 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.580
 With such a limiter I was not lazy 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.150
 change to faster 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.529
 to sew 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.099
 tried to 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.099
 didn't go 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.900
 sew pull 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.979
 cut the threads first below then 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.979
 on top of 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.880
 Here we podgibka looks like this with 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.160

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.010
 any 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:51.539
 that you still have to be manually hemmed 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.539
 so they lay flat did not bring the body 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.310

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.310
