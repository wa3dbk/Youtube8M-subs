00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.019
 for placing a gyproc 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.969
 retention wall 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 with double cladding against the existing one 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 wall you use the middle it 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.529
 system and gyproc plates of 12 and one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.990
 half a mm screw and horizontal with us 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 up to 50 profile on which acoustic tape 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 is applied 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.520
 along the blemish line on the ground cut one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.079
 vertical msv 50 profile to length 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 make it an inch and a half 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.010
 shorter than the distance between floor and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 ceiling 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.690
 place it against the wall put the profile 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 vertical and perpendicular to the spirit level 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.680
 and attach it every 80 centimeters 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.210
 against the wall 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.700
 do the same to the opposite 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.700
 use this for nail picking 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 then place the upper horizontal 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.030
 profile trace for this on the ceiling 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 with the blemish a line between the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 two vertical profiles and attach it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 horizontal profile 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 along the signed line to it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 ceiling 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 clamp the intermediate vertical 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.930
 profiles every 60 centimeters in it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.390
 profile frame 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.979
 put them in the same direction 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.350
 in contrast to a gyproc wall with 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.479
 place single cladding with double 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 plating the second profile with the back 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.310
 to the first profile to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 places also so that the holes for guidance 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 passes in the profiles on the same 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.210
 be aware of this if you have the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.009
 vertical profiles, tailor-cuts, and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.910
 make sure they are with the back so with the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.410
 openings 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.030
 but the opposite wall 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.550
 focused 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 now tighten them with tek screws 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.160
 because the first layer of plates is horizontal 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 is placed 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.860
 screw down the best msv 50 profiles 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.360
 to the ms her 50 profiles 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.100
 this way you prevent them from shifting 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.100
 while screwing the plates 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770
 and H 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.790
 my 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.730
 place the insulated retention wall 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.200
 a non-insulated outside wall for 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.330
 therefore sees behind the profiles and 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.680
 syrup is over glass wool and place one 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.510
 vapor barrier 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 a low level meets this row 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.440
 insulation material to improve the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.300
 sound insulation 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.370
 cut strips of glass wool correctly 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.590
 width with the help of a ruler 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.180
 a putty knife 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.790
 you start for the first layer of plates 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.800
 always put the first plate at the bottom 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 a horizontal level in the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.330
 lower left corner she hit with the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 gyprock screws fixed in the msv 50 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.270
 profiles 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.200
 make sure that the plate is always beautiful 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.180
 the center of the profile 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 is screwed down 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.230
 now place the rest of the plates 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.840
 always mount them staggered 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.240
 compared to the previous row of shed 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.700
 smooth out any rough sides 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.530
 of a races start every row with it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.930
 remaining piece instead of the previous one 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.930
 row and work will complete the entire band 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.450
 apply the second layer late and put them 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.830
 to go far over the first layer 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.110
 please note that the plates about a 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.040
 centimeters shorter than distance 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.040
 between floor and ceiling 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.650
 Pear had the rough sides scampi 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.540
 grating shoes 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.670
 took place with a foot lever 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.410
 against the ceiling so that this one 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.450
 centimeters from the floor removed 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.810
 stays well against it 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.480
 ceiling 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.360
 always start at one end of the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.130
 wall he works the entire wall like this 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.620
 screw the plates of 12 of a half 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.240
 millimeter thick with the self-drilling gyproc 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.920
 tighten the screws 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.959
 always clamp them well draw the ceiling 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.489
 taen with a pedestal 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.010
 respect one while screwing 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.630
 distance of maximum 25 centimeters between 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.370
 the screws 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.320
 always screw staggered from one 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.000
 plate on the other and push the plate 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.910
 always good against the 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.410
 Substructure remains a minimum 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.410
 1 centimeter from the plate edge 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.680
 have you provided in the walton socket 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.020
 fully screw the plate in first 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.270
 the desired for leather with a bell drill 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 where to finally make the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.670
 put the boxes in the opening 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.220
 we then pull with a stitch hook 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.730
 the wiring through the wall and attach the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.730
 contactos 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.199
 all right
