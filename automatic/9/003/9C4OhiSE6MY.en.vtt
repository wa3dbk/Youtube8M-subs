we began development on modern warfare 3
one<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.630> things<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.020> did<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.230> we

one of the first things we did was we

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.440 
one of the first things we did was we
took<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.770> look<00:00:22.920> back<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.190> monitor<00:00:23.850> too<00:00:24.090> we

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
took a look back at monitor too we

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.360 
took a look back at monitor too we
realized<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.200> had<00:00:25.290> made<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.620> game<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.130> one

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
realized we had made the game for one

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.310 
realized we had made the game for one
type<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> player<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.510> player<00:00:27.540> with<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.050> high

rewarded so what we wanted to do was
offer<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.700> same<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.210> reward<00:00:36.600> system<00:00:37.140> for

every type of player so the three

every type of player so the three
different<00:00:40.740> strike<00:00:41.130> packages<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.760> have

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
different strike packages that we have

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.319 
different strike packages that we have
our<00:00:42.329> assault<00:00:43.400> support<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.870> specialist<00:00:47.329> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
our assault support and specialist and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.610 
our assault support and specialist and
they<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.510> work<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.170> different<00:00:49.440> manner

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
they all work in a very different manner

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
they all work in a very different manner
and<00:00:50.130> are<00:00:50.520> geared<00:00:50.910> towards<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.450> different

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and are geared towards a very different

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.660 
and are geared towards a very different
type<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> player<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.040> previously<00:00:53.250> called

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
type of player what we previously called

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
type of player what we previously called
the<00:00:53.880> killstreak<00:00:54.300> system<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.470> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the killstreak system is now it's a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
the killstreak system is now it's a
point<00:00:55.860> streak<00:00:56.100> system<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.730> kills<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.450> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
point streak system so kills are not the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.690 
point streak system so kills are not the
only<00:00:57.630> way<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> move<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.980> streaks<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
only way to move your point streaks for

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700 
only way to move your point streaks for
every<00:01:00.510> strike<00:01:00.720> package<00:01:01.050> takes<00:01:01.260> advantage<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
every strike package takes advantage of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.179 
every strike package takes advantage of
this<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.790> basically<00:01:02.969> means<00:01:03.480> things<00:01:03.960> like

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
this and it basically means things like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.970 
this and it basically means things like
capturing<00:01:05.189> flags

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
capturing flags

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.230 

you're<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> team<00:01:33.890> focused<00:01:34.310> individual<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you're a team focused individual the

you're a team focused individual the
support<00:01:35.630> strike<00:01:35.840> packages<00:01:36.320> for<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.920> the

support strike packages for you so the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.650 
support strike packages for you so the
support<00:01:37.370> package<00:01:37.760> works<00:01:38.030> significantly

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
support package works significantly

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.510 
support package works significantly
different<00:01:38.990> than<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.320> assault<00:01:39.680> package<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
different than the assault package the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.830 
different than the assault package the
main<00:01:40.760> difference<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.270> you'll<00:01:41.360> notice<00:01:41.660> right

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
main difference that you'll notice right

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.770 
main difference that you'll notice right
away<00:01:41.900> is<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.680> your<00:01:43.040> streaks<00:01:43.550> don't<00:01:44.090> reset<00:01:44.600> on

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
away is that your streaks don't reset on

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.650 
away is that your streaks don't reset on
death<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.980> can<00:01:46.310> get<00:01:46.550> a<00:01:46.580> kill<00:01:46.970> capture<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
death so I can get a kill capture the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.470 
death so I can get a kill capture the
flag<00:01:47.840> capture<00:01:48.440> an<00:01:48.650> HQ<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:49.970> moves<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.360> up

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
killstreaks that i unlock are definitely

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.240 
killstreaks that i unlock are definitely
of<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.690> different<00:01:57.170> order<00:01:57.440> than<00:01:57.650> they<00:01:58.070> are<00:01:58.220> in

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
of a different order than they are in

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.310 
of a different order than they are in
the<00:01:58.640> assault<00:01:58.850> strike<00:01:59.120> package<00:01:59.510> they're<00:01:59.960> more

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
the assault strike package they're more

the assault strike package they're more
support<00:02:00.800> oriented<00:02:01.400> things<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.360> UAV<00:02:02.840> jammer

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
support oriented things like UAV jammer

recon<00:02:07.580> drone<00:02:08.050> sentry<00:02:09.050> guns<00:02:09.229> are<00:02:09.380> great<00:02:09.500> right

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
recon drone sentry guns are great right

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.740 
recon drone sentry guns are great right
especially<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.640> team<00:02:10.850> modes<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:11.209> capture

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
especially in team modes like capture

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.449 
especially in team modes like capture
the<00:02:11.780> flag<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.200> throw<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> century<00:02:12.770> turret<00:02:13.100> up

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the flag you throw a century turret up

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.309 
the flag you throw a century turret up
near<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.820> flag<00:02:14.060> point<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.740> lay<00:02:16.100> waste

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.349 

so<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> third<00:02:21.280> strike<00:02:21.549> package<00:02:21.849> we<00:02:21.999> have<00:02:22.180> is

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
so the third strike package we have is
