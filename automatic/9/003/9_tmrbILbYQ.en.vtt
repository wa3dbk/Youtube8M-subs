00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:22.769
 olÃ¨ hi guys today take league 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.310
 they want to make pizza we won't use 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.019
 flour to make another explosion 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 Network but how possible is very 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 simple the flour when it remains suspended 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 it creates the suspension in the air 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.559
 very flammable 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 so our task is to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.579
 recreate this suspension 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 we will use the flour not 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 we advertise a steel tube a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 3 then a lot of alcohol scottex tube 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:08.210
 of pvc a fast lance sticks 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.159
 none and an account 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 let's start with the long steel tube 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.170
 about 30 cm 30 cm and raised 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 it has a diameter of hu jia to two 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 centimeters and a half three 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.040
 then we piss on the end of the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 cane with adhesive tape a piece of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.130
 paper until we succeed in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 get a similar outer diameter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 let's go inside the tube then into 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.920
 so that you don't lose when we go to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 plug here and blow from the other 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.619
 part of the rod this junta must not 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 lose or even lose a little women 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.930
 what we take these are gods 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.640
 toothpicks flights to make skewers 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 we have attached two that together 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.030
 now it's 12 half we will attack them 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.370
 at the end of our steel tube 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.520
 and at the end of these teasing lesi 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.090
 we're going to attack sports 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.430
 let's take two sheets of paper towels 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.590
 we use it this way and after that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.250
 we put them at the end in this way 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.820
 and with the help of the tape we fix it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.770
 here when we go to light everything 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.720
 pour some drops of alcohol 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.310
 inside so to get me to do it 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 take it faster after that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.940
 we turn on thanks to references to this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.700
 we will say the trigger for ours 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.310
 flame now we prepare the mixture then 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.680
 using about one flour 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.990
 fifty grams for each flame 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.220
 just more or less 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.680
 let's go chop this with this fim 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.510
 have one side in the blender 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 otherwise if you don't have it you can use 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.660
 great west end hit for 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.220
 you put a lot of mortar on it 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 but I think the result is soon 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.840
 is the right one 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.660
 nourished and for about 2 3 minutes but 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.239
 just the important thing that is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.770
 enough files to generate ours 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.060
 explosion because it must still remain 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.610
 in suspension in the air therefore must 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.770
 being light enough this will be the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.420
 all assembled so we have the barrel 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.989
 in which we will suffer in this 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.220
 end that enters the steel tube 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.920
 this way 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.020
 before loading the steel tube with 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.300
 a small piece of paper towels let's go to 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.680
 create a kind of valve 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.950
 in this way pushing it to the end 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 with the pvc pipe so that when 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.769
 so we load the weasel when we do 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.290
 we load our flour into the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.930
 steel tube the flour does not fall 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.510
 inside the barrel but when we suffer it 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.510
 in the barrel practically the piece of 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.090
 paper shoots out all the flour 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.590
 after that we are going to apply as 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.709
 we have already applied our own 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.700
 same falling and to whose end we have 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.209
 applied the scott and scottex 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.660
 what we will reward of alcohol and to whom we will give 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.980
 fire 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.070
 so we fill it with flour 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.840
 then we turn on the plunger 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.810
 filled with alcohol when the flame is 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 alive and fine because it serves one 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.950
 amount of big fire to light 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.139
 all the flour 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.090
 let's blow into the ends of the 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.729
 barrel so as to push out the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.770
 flour that practically suspends itself in 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.930
 air and the finest one catches fire 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.010
 creating a large ball of fire a lot 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.110
 beautiful and dangerous and now we try it 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.770
 ok so in this tube we just have 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.160
 loaded the flour mixture and we have 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.320
 positioned this plunger that will be 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.630
 what will turn on the suspension of 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:03.090
 flour now we go to wet with a little 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:06.620
 of alcohol the plunger and this way later 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.620
 what we turn on 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.510
 here then wait for it to take nothing 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:25.030
 I say eco wait wait wait 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:25.030
 even now you go show 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:48.200
 awaits you 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:56.060
 purpose itespresso.it is waiting for 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:06:01.160
 now something went wrong burning 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.330
 some feel the moment we are 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.330
 putting ethyl alcohol 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.240
 amazon fraud we start by putting 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.530
 of ethyl alcohol above but is not 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:21.040
 resuming is not on next 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:21.040
 I believe you're not quiet, even touch
