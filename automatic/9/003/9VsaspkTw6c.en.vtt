00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
quite a nice trick that the kids came up

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
quite a nice trick that the kids came up
with<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> figure<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.110> could<00:00:46.230> stand

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
with was to figure out they could stand

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
with was to figure out they could stand
on<00:00:46.620> top<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.070> car<00:00:47.390> just<00:00:48.390> towards<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> back

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
on top of a car just towards the back

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
on top of a car just towards the back
and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> car<00:00:50.370> would<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.640> realize<00:00:50.850> they

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and then the car would not realize they

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.549 
and then the car would not realize they
were<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> would<00:00:51.690> start<00:00:51.960> cruising

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
were there and would start cruising

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
were there and would start cruising
around<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> city<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.670> could

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
around the city and that way they could

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
around the city and that way they could
tour<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> areas<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.469> an<00:00:55.590> automated
