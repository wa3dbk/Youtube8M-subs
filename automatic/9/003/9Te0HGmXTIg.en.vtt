I found that differences other than

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
I found that differences other than
appearance<00:00:28.140> wise<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.920> makes<00:00:29.130> Punk<00:00:29.460> come

appearance wise what makes Punk come

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.680 
appearance wise what makes Punk come
sorry<00:00:30.630> pumpkaboo<00:00:31.320> super-sized<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.540> okay<00:00:33.540> I'm

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
sorry pumpkaboo super-sized and okay I'm

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.310 
sorry pumpkaboo super-sized and okay I'm
gonna<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> guys<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:35.100> crappy<00:00:35.579> video

how<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.829> size<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> crisis<00:00:39.090> ticker<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:41.450> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
how the size is in crisis ticker so this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.190 
how the size is in crisis ticker so this
is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> tiny<00:00:42.930> size<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:44.160> pumpkaboo<00:00:44.960> go<00:00:45.960> dip<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
is a tiny size of pumpkaboo go dip a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.520 
is a tiny size of pumpkaboo go dip a
little<00:00:46.230> spray<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:49.399> average<00:00:50.399> size<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.530> little

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little spray and average size a little

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
little spray and average size a little
bit<00:00:52.739> bigger<00:00:52.770> can't<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:53.969> tell<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> see

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
bit bigger can't really tell if you see

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.209 
bit bigger can't really tell if you see
a<00:00:55.520> guitar<00:00:56.520> defense<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.149> hanging<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
a guitar defense that's hanging and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
a guitar defense that's hanging and
stick<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> Greg<00:01:01.410> Euler<00:01:01.590> cry<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.809> well<00:01:03.920> before

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
stick the Greg Euler cry for well before

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.370 
stick the Greg Euler cry for well before
gets<00:01:05.100> back<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.000> large<00:01:06.210> size

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
gets back this is large size

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.510 
gets back this is large size
significantly<00:01:09.380> bigger<00:01:09.590> for<00:01:09.860> tiny<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:12.649> all

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
significantly bigger for tiny and all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520 
significantly bigger for tiny and all
three<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.180> those<00:01:14.299> effect<00:01:14.600> sizes<00:01:14.960> have<00:01:15.350> this

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
three of those effect sizes have this

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.010 
three of those effect sizes have this
try<00:01:16.810> just<00:01:17.810> regular<00:01:18.170> fast<00:01:20.439> now<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.500> supersize

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
try just regular fast now the supersize

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.789 
try just regular fast now the supersize
it's<00:01:24.020> not<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.289> much<00:01:24.439> of<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.680> difference

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
it's not that much of a difference

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.389 
it's not that much of a difference
between<00:01:25.340> large<00:01:26.240> well<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.890> can<00:01:28.039> tell<00:01:28.189> from

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
between large well you can tell from

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.419 
between large well you can tell from
here<00:01:29.409> maybe<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.679> wild<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.100> can't<00:01:31.280> really

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
here maybe in the wild you can't really

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.100 
here maybe in the wild you can't really
tell<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.640> difference<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.960> key

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
tell the difference but the key

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.080 
tell the difference but the key
difference<00:01:33.140> through<00:01:33.920> mega<00:01:34.189> size<00:01:34.490> or

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
difference through mega size or

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.690 
difference through mega size or
supersize<00:01:35.539> pumpkaboo<00:01:36.020> visits<00:01:36.530> cry<00:01:36.740> its<00:01:37.039> yes

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
supersize pumpkaboo visits cry its yes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.580 
supersize pumpkaboo visits cry its yes
I'm<00:01:37.909> like<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:40.299> sums<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:41.479> lot<00:01:41.899> deeper<00:01:42.229> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
I'm like this sums a lot deeper and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.590 
I'm like this sums a lot deeper and
slower<00:01:42.920> than<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.729> other<00:01:43.880> three<00:01:44.149> possible

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
slower than the other three possible

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.039 
slower than the other three possible
forms<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:46.030> that's<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.179> make<00:01:47.360> finding<00:01:47.990> a

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
forms so that's to make finding a

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.080 
forms so that's to make finding a
supersize<00:01:48.500> pumpkaboo<00:01:49.069> much<00:01:49.429> easier<00:01:49.819> for<00:01:49.970> you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
supersize pumpkaboo much easier for you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.559 
supersize pumpkaboo much easier for you
guys

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
guys

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.800 
guys
so<00:01:51.610> just<00:01:52.610> remember<00:01:53.289> look<00:01:54.289> for<00:01:54.709> I<00:01:55.190> guess<00:01:56.149> in<00:01:56.659> big

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so just remember look for I guess in big

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.289 
so just remember look for I guess in big
leases<00:01:57.080> bigger<00:01:57.440> size<00:01:57.709> for<00:01:58.520> me<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.640> found<00:01:59.030> mine

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
leases bigger size for me I found mine

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.600 
leases bigger size for me I found mine
floating<00:01:59.929> much<00:02:00.679> higher<00:02:00.950> off<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.130> ground<00:02:01.280> than

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
floating much higher off the ground than

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.850 
floating much higher off the ground than
the<00:02:01.640> other<00:02:01.880> three<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:03.409> different<00:02:03.709> cry

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the other three and the different cry

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580 
the other three and the different cry
well<00:02:04.549> that's<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:05.509> really<00:02:05.869> quick<00:02:06.229> video<00:02:06.409> and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
well that's a really quick video and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830 
well that's a really quick video and
thanks<00:02:07.490> for<00:02:07.610> watching<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.239> I'll<00:02:08.630> see<00:02:08.660> you
