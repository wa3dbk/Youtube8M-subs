layout that I recently came across as i
was<00:00:19.259> looking<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.650> bases<00:00:20.099> in<00:00:21.000> various<00:00:21.450> trophy

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
was looking at bases in various trophy

was looking at bases in various trophy
leagues<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.800> first<00:00:23.460> off<00:00:23.640> i<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.239> he<00:00:24.360> wants

leagues now first off i think he wants

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.260 
leagues now first off i think he wants
to<00:00:24.779> swap<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.619> mortar<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.700> that<00:00:26.849> cannon

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
to swap out that mortar with that cannon

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.150 
to swap out that mortar with that cannon
on<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:27.509> bottom<00:00:27.840> left<00:00:28.020> corner<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:29.009> that

on the bottom left corner when that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.100 
on the bottom left corner when that
mortar<00:00:29.489> is<00:00:29.579> done<00:00:29.759> upgrading<00:00:30.239> so<00:00:30.450> just<00:00:30.960> wanna

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
mortar is done upgrading so just wanna

mortar is done upgrading so just wanna
make<00:00:31.200> you<00:00:31.320> aware<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.559> that<00:00:31.829> I<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
centralized clan castle as well as how

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
centralized clan castle as well as how
he<00:00:36.989> puts<00:00:37.260> his<00:00:37.379> storages<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.070> different

he puts his storages in different
compartments<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:39.750> makes<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.320> harder<00:00:40.620> for

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

storages from my farming perspective if

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.959 
storages from my farming perspective if
I<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.559> type<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> base<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.339> usually<00:00:47.850> hit

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
I see this type of base I usually hit

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.509 
I see this type of base I usually hit
next<00:00:48.269> because<00:00:48.749> if<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:49.859> storages<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
next because if i see is storages that

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.270 
next because if i see is storages that
are<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.879> spread<00:00:51.239> apart<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.719> each<00:00:51.839> other<00:00:51.960> i

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
are that spread apart from each other i

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
are that spread apart from each other i
really<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.429> only<00:00:53.609> get<00:00:53.940> two<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.359> three<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> each

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
really can only get two or three of each

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
really can only get two or three of each
gold<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.679> elixir<00:00:55.769> at<00:00:56.190> most<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:57.269> things<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
gold and elixir at most now things I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
gold and elixir at most now things I
would<00:00:58.019> change<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.890> swap<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
would change is probably swap that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.239 
would change is probably swap that
wizard<00:00:59.879> tower<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.659> those<00:01:01.199> air<00:01:01.499> defenses<00:01:02.039> as

the air defenses are a little bit

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.070 
the air defenses are a little bit
exposed<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.120> Wizards<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.840> zap

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
exposed and you want the Wizards to zap

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
soon as they are deployed now I might

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
soon as they are deployed now I might
also<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> spread<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.520> Expos

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
also want to spread out the Expos

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.150 
also want to spread out the Expos
because<00:01:14.970> sometimes<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:16.080> Town<00:01:16.350> Hall<00:01:16.560> tens<00:01:16.830> do

because sometimes when Town Hall tens do

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.370 
because sometimes when Town Hall tens do
attack<00:01:17.430> Town<00:01:17.700> Hall<00:01:17.880> 9<00:01:17.910> s<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.780> easy<00:01:19.110> for

attack Town Hall 9 s if it's easy for

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the Town Hall tend to freeze the to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.740 
the Town Hall tend to freeze the to
expose<00:01:22.440> with<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.950> free<00:01:23.220> spell<00:01:23.520> sometimes<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
expose with one free spell sometimes the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
expose with one free spell sometimes the
Town<00:01:24.960> Hall<00:01:24.990> 10<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.160> now<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.880> terms

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
Town Hall 10 will do that now in terms

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.480 
Town Hall 10 will do that now in terms
of<00:01:27.210> hidden<00:01:27.630> Tesla<00:01:28.020> placement<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.620> thinking

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
of hidden Tesla placement I'm thinking

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.830 
of hidden Tesla placement I'm thinking
they<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.670> either<00:01:29.910> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> core<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> base

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
they are either in the core of the base

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
they are either in the core of the base
or<00:01:31.050> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> outer<00:01:31.740> core<00:01:32.160> next<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.940> mortars

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
or on the outer core next to the mortars

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.150 
or on the outer core next to the mortars
either<00:01:33.840> placement<00:01:34.410> works<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.830> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.980> want

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
either placement works but if you want

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.650 
either placement works but if you want
to<00:01:35.220> move<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> Expos<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.300> bit<00:01:36.480> I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
to move the Expos out a little bit I

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.390 
to move the Expos out a little bit I
would<00:01:36.900> stick<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.260> hidden<00:01:37.500> Tesla's<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
would stick the hidden Tesla's in the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
would stick the hidden Tesla's in the
outer<00:01:38.580> core<00:01:38.940> next<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.510> mortars<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
outer core next to the mortars now I was

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
outer core next to the mortars now I was
also<00:01:40.920> contemplating<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.820> hero<00:01:42.030> placement

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
also contemplating the hero placement

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
also contemplating the hero placement
and<00:01:42.840> right<00:01:43.680> now<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.220> works<00:01:44.670> where<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.210> are

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and right now it works where they are

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
and right now it works where they are
sometimes<00:01:45.870> people<00:01:46.410> tend<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> over

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sometimes people tend to over

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
sometimes people tend to over
centralized<00:01:48.210> their<00:01:48.480> heroes<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.080> by<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.410> time

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
centralized their heroes and by the time

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.320 
centralized their heroes and by the time
an<00:01:49.830> attacker<00:01:50.100> makes<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> middle<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
an attacker makes it to the middle of

an attacker makes it to the middle of
that<00:01:51.480> base<00:01:51.750> by<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.890> too<00:01:52.980> late<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that base by then it's too late and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.800 
that base by then it's too late and
there's<00:01:53.580> nothing<00:01:53.760> left<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> heroes<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
there's nothing left for the heroes to
protect<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> hero<00:01:56.280> placement

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
protect so I think the hero placement

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.150 
protect so I think the hero placement
