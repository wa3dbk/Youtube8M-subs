00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
can kind of see where we're going here

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.719 
can kind of see where we're going here
now<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.610> also<00:01:44.909> showed<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
now we also showed you one of the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
now we also showed you one of the
McDonald's<00:01:47.729> older<00:01:48.540> toys<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.110> were<00:01:49.290> which

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
McDonald's older toys which were which

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
McDonald's older toys which were which
looked<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:51.060> previous<00:01:51.659> years<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
looked like this from previous years and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
looked like this from previous years and
they're<00:01:53.549> about<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.939> same<00:01:54.149> size<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.960> that's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
they're about the same size so that's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
they're about the same size so that's
cool<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.460> match<00:01:57.060> them<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.630> little

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
cool that they match them just a little

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
cool that they match them just a little
bit<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.469> otherwise<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.280> design<00:01:59.640> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
bit but otherwise the design is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.539 
bit but otherwise the design is
different<00:02:00.000> these<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.049> different<00:02:01.439> things

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
different these can do different things

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.069 
different these can do different things
so<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.119> far<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
so what do you think so far so this is

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.889 
so what do you think so far so this is
number<00:02:04.229> three<00:02:04.560> four<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.219> five<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.329> let<00:02:06.780> me

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
number three four and five so let me

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.199 
number three four and five so let me
grab<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> number<00:02:07.530> six<00:02:07.890> toy<00:02:08.160> put<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.090> back

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

let's<00:02:14.080> see<00:02:14.230> what<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.530> does<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> no

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
let's see what this one does so no

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.570 
let's see what this one does so no
instructions<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.620> let's<00:02:20.800> see<00:02:20.980> what<00:02:21.160> playful

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
instructions so let's see what playful

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.770 
instructions so let's see what playful
eyes<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:23.460> lenticular<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.000> way<00:02:25.150> so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
eyes so they are lenticular in a way so

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
eyes so they are lenticular in a way so
when<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:25.990> move<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.380> certain<00:02:26.710> way<00:02:26.920> well<00:02:27.910> if

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
when you move on a certain way well if

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.280 
when you move on a certain way well if
the<00:02:28.120> camera<00:02:28.420> doesn't<00:02:28.450> always<00:02:28.750> pick<00:02:28.990> up<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the camera doesn't always pick up that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.520 
the camera doesn't always pick up that
lenticular<00:02:30.100> movement<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.080> there<00:02:34.320> okay

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
lenticular movement see it there okay

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.470 
lenticular movement see it there okay
so<00:02:36.070> now<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:36.460> what<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.760> does<00:02:37.030> let's<00:02:37.300> take

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
so now we know what that does let's take

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
so now we know what that does let's take
a<00:02:37.510> look<00:02:37.750> at<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.930> back<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.640> pretty

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
a look at the back of this one pretty

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.030 
a look at the back of this one pretty
standard<00:02:40.240> no<00:02:41.230> color<00:02:41.500> detail<00:02:41.890> back<00:02:42.130> there

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
standard no color detail back there

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.949 
standard no color detail back there
that's<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.280> lenticular<00:02:45.970> hide<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.720> we<00:02:46.840> have

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that's the lenticular hide so we have

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.880 
that's the lenticular hide so we have
three<00:02:47.260> now<00:02:47.550> actually<00:02:48.550> all<00:02:48.610> four<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.300> basically

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
three now actually all four so basically

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.680
