00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello friends with you right now 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.009
 we'll see this together 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.389
 wonderful mod adds meinkravt 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.740
 just one thing well, like a living thing 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 thing is a burning well, not really a thing well 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.189
 as there is no unit dude unit who 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.730
 appears pretty well that is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 quite rare but he 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 quite valuable where he usually 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 appears anywhere anywhere that is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 and anywhere on the surface but not in how 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 not in mines that is always in the forest 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 somewhere in the glades rare more often in the forest 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.100
 this is such a mobitz which 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:54.350
 called as a chest a chest a chest could 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 well this is a chest could he not run away from us 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.600
 now i'm in gay mode 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 I go to him he is not aggressive 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 he is absolutely friendly and he is not from us 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.180
 runs away until we hit him we 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.250
 take and he starts to run away but he to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.100
 our happiness is rather slow 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 pretty slow some kind of hell of it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.650
 39 hepe by the way I live hit before 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 once and he now has hbp-13 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.869
 in general , we wo nâ€™t even play 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 can attack anything about us but we 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.450
 we can get a small initial 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 boost 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.090
 as long as we as long as we walk along 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 mines we get some resources yes a 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.770
 while we run on the surface so as not to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.350
 lose time we too we can get 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 differently-differently but all this differently will be 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.780
 drop randomly that is arrow bread 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.320
 gold and all sorts of useful things 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 little things 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.600

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.030
 bonuses are small very small always 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.110
 well, you know, you need food 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 It becomes well, in general, a little bit 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.610
 makes life easier but thereby makes 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.800
 the gameplay is a little nicer here and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.880
