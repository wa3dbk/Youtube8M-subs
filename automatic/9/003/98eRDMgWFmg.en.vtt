00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that I found and they're a bunch of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
that I found and they're a bunch of
single-use<00:00:41.309> plastic<00:00:42.149> cups<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.109> we

throwing<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> bunch<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> plastic<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
throwing out a bunch of plastic is a

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.119 
throwing out a bunch of plastic is a
really<00:00:47.760> bad<00:00:47.940> idea<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.949> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
really bad idea so what you can do is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.939 
really bad idea so what you can do is
pick<00:00:50.370> up<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.089> these<00:00:51.300> things<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.949> several

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
your grinder may vary but you don't want

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.809 
your grinder may vary but you don't want
it<00:02:35.180> set<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.720> normal<00:02:36.620> drip<00:02:36.920> coffee<00:02:37.220> grounds

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
because like I said not going to spend a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.619 
because like I said not going to spend a
whole<00:02:39.980> lot<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.459> time<00:02:40.670> interacting<00:02:41.120> with<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
whole lot of time interacting with the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.580 
whole lot of time interacting with the
water<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.150> espresso<00:02:44.870> you

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
water so if you do it on espresso you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.650 
water so if you do it on espresso you
may<00:02:45.860> actually<00:02:46.099> clog<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.180> little<00:02:47.420> metal

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
may actually clog the little metal

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.030 
may actually clog the little metal
filter<00:02:48.190> which<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> mess<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:53.920> grab<00:02:54.920> yourself

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
filter which is a mess so grab yourself

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.559 
filter which is a mess so grab yourself
some<00:02:55.489> beans<00:02:55.730> oh<00:03:00.130> yeah<00:03:01.130> definitely<00:03:01.849> good<00:03:02.299> stuff

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.500 

to<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.790> top

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.449 

occasionally<00:03:16.510> I'll<00:03:16.950> tamp<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.099> thing<00:03:18.310> now

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
occasionally I'll tamp the thing now

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.630 
occasionally I'll tamp the thing now
just<00:03:18.730> by<00:03:19.349> gently<00:03:20.349> tapping<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.099> that<00:03:21.310> but

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
just by gently tapping it like that but

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
just by gently tapping it like that but
never<00:03:22.300> ever<00:03:22.660> press<00:03:23.170> anything<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.739> there

never ever press anything in there

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.350 
never ever press anything in there
because<00:03:24.099> you<00:03:24.190> don't<00:03:24.280> want<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.610> be<00:03:24.730> compact

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
because you don't want it to be compact

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.250 
because you don't want it to be compact
you<00:03:25.569> don't<00:03:25.720> want<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> coffee

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
right up to the top and like that now

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.699 
right up to the top and like that now
this'll<00:03:33.550> let<00:03:33.790> me<00:03:34.830> get<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.950> lid<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:37.500> nice<00:03:38.500> and

this'll let me get the lid on nice and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.770 
this'll let me get the lid on nice and
tight<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.760> putting<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.060> much<00:03:40.239> coffee<00:03:40.480> in

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780

tight but it's putting as much coffee in
there<00:03:40.930> as<00:03:41.019> possible<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:42.430> coffee

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.330 
cup I'm using just whole milk here
however<00:04:50.380> much<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.860> think<00:04:51.039> you're<00:04:51.130> going<00:04:51.280> to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340

microwave

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.250 

where<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.390> sack

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.290 

your<00:05:09.860> microwave<00:05:10.190> times<00:05:10.550> may<00:05:10.820> vary<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:11.240> course

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
your microwave times may vary of course

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.160 
your microwave times may vary of course
so<00:05:12.340> 20<00:05:13.340> seconds<00:05:13.910> for<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.270> little<00:05:14.810> bit<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:14.990> cream

so 20 seconds for a little bit of cream

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.480 
so 20 seconds for a little bit of cream
in<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.380> bottom<00:05:15.530> tends<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:16.070> get<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.310> hot

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
in the bottom tends to get it hot

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.910 
in the bottom tends to get it hot
without<00:05:16.730> actually<00:05:17.240> burning<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.870> milk<00:05:18.140> which
