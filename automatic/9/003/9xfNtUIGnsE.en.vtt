version<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.540> himself<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.650> great<00:01:11.119> but

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
version of himself now this is great but

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.740 
version of himself now this is great but
it<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.570> makes<00:01:13.530> things<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:15.450> more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it also makes things a little bit more

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
it also makes things a little bit more
difficult<00:01:16.130> since<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.369> big<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.850> hard<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> hit

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

a small tennis ball and it really is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.740 
a small tennis ball and it really is
interesting<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.200> works<00:01:23.570> most<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
interesting to see how it works most of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.249 
interesting to see how it works most of
the<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.350> big<00:01:25.530> mushrooms<00:01:26.100> appear<00:01:27.259> rather

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the time the big mushrooms appear rather

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
the time the big mushrooms appear rather
at<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> same<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.850> things<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.210> get

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
at the same time but things really get

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
at the same time but things really get
interesting<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.229> player<00:01:31.650> manages<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
interesting when one player manages to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.749
