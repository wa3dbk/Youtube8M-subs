00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.340
 for all the files we have a control video and the cups in 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 urged the mayor today that this first part because 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.449
 the cost of ere the own purple team of that same place with subjects like my 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.179
 uncle 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.509
 that is tensing the hc 2000 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.749
 wolf among the mercedes courses 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.880
 because I wanted to give a little bit of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.220
 I'm going to make a little girl know and hope to give a little bit of cobo 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.920
 In my opinion 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600
 improvements are used 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.190
 this you play houses 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.660
 and in venezuela very much this game the shotguns adn and m 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.199
 uncomfortable comfortable and 4 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.870
 I love the first module 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.540
 Tevez that the crests as they are inspire more primary 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.040
 per hundred a different way or at least a broad 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 little incentive to use them when night one as a player 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.550
 the reason is obvious because it has very little the case that it has a lot of power 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.950
 and because there are so many other weapons like universities can 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.810
 practically towards the same year at close range 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.570
 then bury a bit of the strategy that I used when their 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.250
 protests 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 that by the way he used them a lot and a scare to the shotguns 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.210
 in this endeavor in this opportunity to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.260
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.360
 unlock the finishes what allows a part to that carlos tevez for hs 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.300
 2000 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.130
 a hundred because in the past prestige makes very little shotguns here in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 the coast maintains with an attack on each 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.800
 in my favorites at this moment they are 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.100
 well I like that much much more than fas 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.630
 that is very little reach 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.230
 I like the Aztec, despite six pomp, who means that in each 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 style shoots have to do is 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190
 this idiot animation and ye 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.710
 d reload the weapon 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.070
 so olimpia that angel has lamas that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.030
 he has a lot the chancellor estimated year as shotguns 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.409
 but it has a double problem that she 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.170
 that reload every shot 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.499
 then but maybe the class as I recommend you weeks ago 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.090
 by the ogre 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 depending on the map you should do what I am doing and field if 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.750
 the maps that are drowning from skylanders an easy subject anticipated hand 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.649
 or onyango 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.589
 when with other years in this party but it does not matter the big maps 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:20.399
 in the shotgun pit in enclosed spaces like this kind of rooms when they want 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.039
 clean the room the flowerpot 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.009
 and when you have to kill enemies try to take the weapon 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.179
 and in this opportunity I had removed the weapon a beggar that supports you 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.399
 here to 47 with silencer that is a beast 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.399
 is the only one that I like to be 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.739
 no but they will see later that the burning text also said 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.419
 reporter 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.200
 the witnesses are in seven deaths 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.519
 the attack helicopter 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.980
 in sports and black block and 11 coalition but at the same time the period 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.389
 what happened he did not care 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.259
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.709
 a boy that we follow 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.329
 the shotguns as is being said 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.329
 in for the attack but smaller things 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.959
 note 1 inclusive in fray bentos half of the protests all combat what 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.760
 be clarified nearby trying the ballet where my classmates are this 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.059
 pitis theme that the athletic earth 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.119
 I try not to accept that my colleagues 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.310
 to be able to and always tried to enter 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.989
 possible controversial 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.629
 diane xunta mental 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.400
 I did not know that the baby grows today's deal I reconsidered archer that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.459
 I would cut it off, I think it happened to me that he managed to cut off that I shot him and still not 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.999
 it ends up killing 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 in a shotgun text I like it because 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.249
 they have faster parents be 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.639
 for very fast with a shotgun but it has the disadvantage that the mistress has 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.509
 four wings in 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.919
 in the bedroom 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.319
 I recommend the following because when it is not respected 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.749
 and good of the pp is the one that you like the most I like to use in this marathon 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:49.689
 why 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.290
 per hundred but in this case marathon pro to be able to reach quickly the 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.899
 instead of our enemies 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.749
 in the yellow country he always of recoletos until the end 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.079
 because most of the shotgun especially a good time to recharge 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.259
 ing the weapon 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.539
 and in the park sun 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.019
 can not miss is 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.349
 scariolo scavenger as in Spain 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.359
 the reason is because in expectations with virtually no bullets 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.180
 it's very very very few downloading bullets that have 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.970
 the best thing is that they were not planned for this year prob 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.360
 so that once a is comandada signal magazine 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.529
 and when they speak already bushes or enemy are always recharging 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.320
 well everyone here in the kitchen from there 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.050
 Per hundred as you can see it's always there amazing, leaning on the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.550
 liquid of the goalmates when they take it out the current 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.639
 I tell you are better if you of this game 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.680
 a fifth and simply and trying to catch his enemies in 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.159
 the most logical places startle 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.339
 noticing moving on maps is a scientific recommendation 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.389
 we want to be strong the bulletin 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.959
 but you can do a lot dead in a qatar airways game on the maps 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.839
 in the width of the map have instead of trying to run by order of the map 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.449
 try death 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.430
 in the wide sea 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.520
 i try to avoid as much as they can the central area of ​​the map as it happens 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.580
 among other places 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.059
 after ten days of recovery and reconstruction 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.520
 uses art nightclubs located on small screens 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.139
 inserted in a whisper for example playing let's say it's for a frieze 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:26.789
 steal 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.110
 for the moment 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.460
 there's nothing more satisfying though the Mapuche weights because he almost never 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.210
 a good few people in parties that touch them as badly as few times as 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.430
 what are you seeing here 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.389
 in case the truth since the shotgun is sincere the voice or 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.979
 that maybe 2 26 dead highlighted the game the best 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.249
 8 death he took a shotgun to take san jose 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.249
 or contagios ceiling with the weapons that better the envites 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.009
 percent that harasses them the use of blackberry I've seen a lot of people 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.089
 who uses 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.439
 stupid percent who play very good and excellent teamwork 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.479
 I'm going to tell you a little secret that may be useful when the riot 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.860
 santiuste that he is 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.270
 they always try 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.650
 Well obviously if it's the last of your uncles that then 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.979
 as long as it will make it easy 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.889
 prestes is playing with three former highs such as having the judge of 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.759
 first instance the dust facts 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.189
 the last the dogs 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.110
 do not use the scourge another salt laker tribe until it ends up all the 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.099
 kiosks the reason is this 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.400
 I just tried that way to be able 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.580
 use where you intended to take the next target 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.419
 understands then maybe this one has died send the blackpool have 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.590
 two enemies can 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.189
 very easily until the next eight deaths 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.569
 for today is all day I hope you liked it please name 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.740
 chili right there 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.680
 and endowed with people
