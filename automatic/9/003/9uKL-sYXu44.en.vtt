this<00:00:12.540> has<00:00:12.719> um<00:00:13.309> fault<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> tension<00:00:15.949> yeah

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
this has um fault for the tension yeah

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.870 
this has um fault for the tension yeah
the<00:00:17.670> safe<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.020> sketchy<00:00:19.439> here

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
the safe and so it's very sketchy here

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.490 
the safe and so it's very sketchy here
this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> supposed<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> UM<00:00:21.539> spring-loaded

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
this is supposed to UM spring-loaded

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.830 
this is supposed to UM spring-loaded
taking<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.070> hold<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.430> swing<00:00:23.670> over<00:00:23.880> their<00:00:24.150> head

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
taking a hold of swing over their head

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.410 
taking a hold of swing over their head
of<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.019> certain<00:00:25.320> tension<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:26.490> its<00:00:26.699> feet<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
of a certain tension as its feet so it

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.779 
of a certain tension as its feet so it
gets<00:00:27.869> tangled<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.769> makes<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.460> mess<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
gets tangled up in here makes a mess of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.920 
gets tangled up in here makes a mess of
everything<00:00:30.920> cuz<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.099> spot<00:00:32.570> yeah<00:00:33.570> man

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
everything cuz of that spot yeah man

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.540 
everything cuz of that spot yeah man
just<00:00:33.960> didn't<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.190> anymore<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
just didn't want to have it anymore I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.180 
just didn't want to have it anymore I
just<00:00:35.670> thought<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.829> give<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> me

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just thought it out so give it to me

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
just thought it out so give it to me
instead<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.520> thought<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> beam<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.870> then

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
instead of thought up the beam and then

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
instead of thought up the beam and then
we've<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> order<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> same

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we've got to order one of the same

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.799 
we've got to order one of the same
mirror<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.180> more<00:00:45.180> logically

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
mirror as this this is a more logically

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.080 
mirror as this this is a more logically
model<00:00:46.140> accordance<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.800> controller<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
model accordance with controller this is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.830 
model accordance with controller this is
all<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> stuff<00:00:48.690> original<00:00:50.840> putting

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
all the stuff original putting

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
all the stuff original putting
interesting<00:00:52.199> stuff<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.829> killing<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
interesting stuff so by killing a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.270 
interesting stuff so by killing a
resistor<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.469> sliding<00:00:55.770> speed

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
resistor but on a little sliding speed

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.779 
resistor but on a little sliding speed
controls<00:00:57.620> points:5<00:00:58.620> ant<00:00:58.949> blow<00:00:59.190> next<00:01:01.609> it's<00:01:02.609> got

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
controls points:5 ant blow next it's got

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.190 
controls points:5 ant blow next it's got
a<00:01:02.820> three<00:01:03.650> must<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.360> common<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.540> low<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a three must be a common and low and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539 
a three must be a common and low and
high<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.860> may<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.220> supposed

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
high or something on it may be supposed

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.940 
high or something on it may be supposed
to<00:01:08.640> tear<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.119> book<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.890> there's<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to tear this thing book up there's a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.140 
to tear this thing book up there's a
little<00:01:11.159> motor<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> controls<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
little motor which it controls it's a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
little motor which it controls it's a
rather<00:01:15.450> model<00:01:17.000> VX<00:01:18.000> 800<00:01:18.450> i<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.610> made

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
rather model VX 800 i think it is made

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
rather model VX 800 i think it is made
in<00:01:20.759> taiwan<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> motor<00:01:23.640> model<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.500> e2<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
in taiwan the motor model is e2 and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:40.060 
in taiwan the motor model is e2 and
point<00:01:26.549> three<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:35.509> its<00:01:36.509> fireworks<00:01:37.579> yeah

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
point three for its fireworks yeah

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
point three for its fireworks yeah
slowly<00:01:41.070> forgive<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.030> gradually<00:01:42.689> get

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.450 

pretty<00:02:05.450> anxiously<00:02:05.780> behold<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.280> life

that<00:02:23.239> shaft<00:02:25.150> pretty<00:02:26.150> interesting<00:02:26.600> got<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> big

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that shaft pretty interesting got a big

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.380 
that shaft pretty interesting got a big
con<00:02:27.410> rod<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> very<00:02:30.709> very<00:02:31.070> tightly<00:02:31.820> bolted

onto this end cap a tired and very sick

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.370 
onto this end cap a tired and very sick
I<00:02:34.550> get<00:02:34.790> where<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.090> separates<00:02:35.780> they're<00:02:36.200> about

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
I get where it separates they're about

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.000 
I get where it separates they're about
to<00:02:36.590> get<00:02:36.680> its<00:02:37.090> yeah<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.420> tight<00:02:38.920> there's<00:02:39.920> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
to get its yeah that's tight there's a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.000 
to get its yeah that's tight there's a
put<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:40.550> through<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.560> much<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.860> an

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
put it all through so much like an

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.400 
put it all through so much like an
engine<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.000> I'm<00:02:44.090> almost<00:02:44.420> metal<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.019> exact
