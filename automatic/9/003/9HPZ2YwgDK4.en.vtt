00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.749 

Apple<00:01:07.130> page<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.549> almost<00:01:07.909> done<00:01:09.310> hard<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.490> tell

Apple page is almost done hard to tell

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.810 
Apple page is almost done hard to tell
with<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.299> trio

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.810 

have<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> page<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.870> still<00:01:17.990> learning

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.640 

and<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.720> Apple<00:01:24.020> page<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.350> done<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.290> trio

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
and the Apple page is done and the trio

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:57.210 
and the Apple page is done and the trio
is<00:01:31.960> still<00:01:32.960> going

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.440 

and<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.090> tree<00:01:58.300> of<00:01:58.420> page<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.810> done

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.660 

so<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.320> took<00:02:05.469> about<00:02:07.530> 15<00:02:08.530> 20<00:02:08.709> 30<00:02:08.979> seconds<00:02:09.459> longer

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
so it took about 15 20 30 seconds longer

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.259 
so it took about 15 20 30 seconds longer
