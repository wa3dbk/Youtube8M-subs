minute of every game in HD and
additionally<00:00:09.540> we're<00:00:09.690> capturing<00:00:09.900> matches

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
additionally we're capturing matches

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.440 
additionally we're capturing matches
from<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.769> American<00:00:11.130> reo<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.969> 4k

I'm<00:00:20.050> still<00:00:20.260> here<00:00:20.380> talking<00:00:20.500> to<00:00:20.770> you<00:00:20.860> in<00:00:20.980> Munich

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
I'm still here talking to you in Munich

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.850 
I'm still here talking to you in Munich
in<00:00:21.610> an<00:00:22.090> old<00:00:22.330> aluminium<00:00:22.870> smelting<00:00:23.350> warehouse

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
in an old aluminium smelting warehouse

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.280 
in an old aluminium smelting warehouse
and<00:00:24.280> basically<00:00:24.850> this<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.330> build<00:00:25.570> site<00:00:25.840> for

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
and basically this is the build site for

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.160 
and basically this is the build site for
the<00:00:26.410> 2014<00:00:27.310> World<00:00:27.580> Cup<00:00:27.700> so<00:00:28.630> here<00:00:28.990> we're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
the 2014 World Cup so here we're

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.140 
the 2014 World Cup so here we're
preparing<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.980> technical<00:00:30.550> facilities<00:00:30.970> which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
preparing the technical facilities which

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.370 
preparing the technical facilities which
are<00:00:31.210> going<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.390> go<00:00:31.510> into<00:00:31.630> each<00:00:31.840> of<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.110> 12

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
are going to go into each of the 12

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.630 
are going to go into each of the 12
venues<00:00:32.529> across<00:00:32.830> Brazil<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:36.100> an<00:00:36.220> engineering

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
venues across Brazil from an engineering

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.549 
venues across Brazil from an engineering
perspective<00:00:36.820> we<00:00:37.450> have<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.720> look<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:38.290> there

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
perspective we have to look is there

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.350 
perspective we have to look is there
facilities<00:00:39.160> available<00:00:39.340> what<00:00:40.120> are<00:00:40.239> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
facilities available what are the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.660 
facilities available what are the
distances<00:00:40.570> what<00:00:41.380> are<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.680> challenges<00:00:42.280> in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
distances what are the challenges in

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.229 
distances what are the challenges in
Brazil<00:00:43.510> there's<00:00:43.840> huge<00:00:44.290> distances<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.970> is

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
Brazil there's huge distances so it is

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.500 
Brazil there's huge distances so it is
not<00:00:46.540> possible<00:00:47.080> to<00:00:47.140> move<00:00:47.440> OB<00:00:47.860> vans<00:00:48.100> across<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
not possible to move OB vans across the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.470 
not possible to move OB vans across the
other<00:00:49.720> thing<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.260> our<00:00:51.250> operation<00:00:51.970> has<00:00:52.090> become

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
other thing is our operation has become

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.540 
other thing is our operation has become
so<00:00:52.720> big<00:00:53.020> because<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.620> our<00:00:53.830> multi-feed

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
so big because of our multi-feed

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.090 
so big because of our multi-feed
programming<00:00:55.240> that<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.930> cannot<00:00:56.380> do<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:56.740> in<00:00:56.890> one

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
programming that we cannot do it in one

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.850 
programming that we cannot do it in one
tractor<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.180> if<00:00:58.510> we<00:00:58.810> would<00:00:59.020> prefer<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.590> truck

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
tractor so if we would prefer a truck

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.650 
tractor so if we would prefer a truck
solution<00:01:00.460> we<00:01:00.579> would<00:01:00.730> end<00:01:00.940> up<00:01:01.060> with<00:01:01.210> at<00:01:01.480> least

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
solution we would end up with at least

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.859 
solution we would end up with at least
two<00:01:02.050> trucks<00:01:02.620> plus<00:01:03.010> an<00:01:03.190> external<00:01:03.820> replay<00:01:04.239> room

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
two trucks plus an external replay room

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.200 
two trucks plus an external replay room
so<00:01:05.259> we<00:01:05.740> decided<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.400> we<00:01:06.520> have<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.000> think

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
so we decided that we have to think

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.170 
so we decided that we have to think
about<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.570> fixed<00:01:07.900> installation<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.060> this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
about a fixed installation so this

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
about a fixed installation so this
project<00:01:10.540> involves<00:01:10.899> building<00:01:11.110> 12

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
project involves building 12

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880 
project involves building 12
containerized<00:01:12.820> control<00:01:13.479> areas<00:01:13.899> with<00:01:14.560> nine

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
containerized control areas with nine

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.920 
containerized control areas with nine
rooms<00:01:15.190> attached<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.670> them<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:16.360> also<00:01:16.509> have<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
rooms attached to them we also have to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.719 
rooms attached to them we also have to
build<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.320> 12<00:01:17.619> sets<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.190> equipment<00:01:18.460> which

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
build the 12 sets of equipment which

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.850 
build the 12 sets of equipment which
you're<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.000> go<00:01:19.149> into<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.509> venue's<00:01:19.869> and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
you're going to go into the venue's and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.710 
you're going to go into the venue's and
then<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.280> have<00:01:21.430> eight<00:01:21.729> crews<00:01:22.149> who<00:01:22.330> move<00:01:22.570> around

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
then we have eight crews who move around

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.749 
then we have eight crews who move around
Brazil<00:01:23.259> based<00:01:23.860> on<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> mass<00:01:24.250> reg<00:01:24.490> or<00:01:26.759> Sony's

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
Brazil based on the mass reg or Sony's

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.219 
Brazil based on the mass reg or Sony's
providing<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> bulk<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.720> cameras<00:01:29.110> to
