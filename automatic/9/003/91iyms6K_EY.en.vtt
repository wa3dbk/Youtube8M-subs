just<00:02:36.070> click<00:02:38.190> auto<00:02:39.190> detect<00:02:39.730> speeds<00:02:40.000> recommend

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
just click auto detect speeds recommend

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.170 
just click auto detect speeds recommend
it<00:02:40.660> click<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:42.820> okay<00:02:47.940> okay<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
it click that and then okay okay and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.030 
it click that and then okay okay and
then<00:02:49.540> you're<00:02:49.570> supposed<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.080> allow<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.680> missed

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
then you're supposed to allow I missed

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.410 
then you're supposed to allow I missed
that<00:02:51.190> part<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.840> let<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:52.990> see<00:02:55.980> oh<00:02:57.330> there<00:02:58.330> we<00:02:58.390> go

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
that part so let me see oh there we go

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.460 
that part so let me see oh there we go
so<00:02:59.140> now<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.380> can<00:02:59.590> set<00:02:59.800> your<00:02:59.920> maximum<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:01.470> one

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so now you can set your maximum to one

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.960 
so now you can set your maximum to one
point<00:03:02.620> three<00:03:02.770> gigahertz<00:03:03.160> right<00:03:03.520> there<00:03:03.700> as<00:03:03.820> you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
point three gigahertz right there as you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.800 
point three gigahertz right there as you
can<00:03:04.150> see<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.800> also<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.790> can<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.270> put<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
can see and also you can have it put it

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.990 
can see and also you can have it put it
on<00:03:07.930> demand<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.340> automatically

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
on demand so it all we automatically

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.210 
on demand so it all we automatically
will<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.050> up<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.350> one<00:03:11.500> point<00:03:11.650> three<00:03:11.770> gigahertz

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
will go up to one point three gigahertz

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.700 
will go up to one point three gigahertz
and<00:03:12.720> then<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.020> cannot<00:03:14.230> put<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.650> on

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
and then you cannot put it on

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.050 
and then you cannot put it on
performance<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.520> going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.670> drain<00:03:15.910> your

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
performance but it's going to drain your

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.120 
performance but it's going to drain your
battery<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.770> then<00:03:18.120> oops<00:03:20.700> go<00:03:21.700> back<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.000> set<00:03:22.180> cpu

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
battery and then oops go back to set cpu

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.040 
battery and then oops go back to set cpu
and<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.370> can<00:03:24.580> also<00:03:24.880> set<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.420> on<00:03:25.510> boots<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:25.900> it's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
and you can also set it on boots so it's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.050 
and you can also set it on boots so it's
always<00:03:26.230> running<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.010> can<00:03:27.250> always<00:03:27.550> it's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
always running so you can always it's

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.030 
always running so you can always it's
automatically<00:03:28.630> going<00:03:28.750> up<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.260> 1.3<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.920> her

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
automatically going up to 1.3 get her

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.030 
automatically going up to 1.3 get her
one<00:03:30.700> point<00:03:30.910> three<00:03:31.000> gigahertz<00:03:31.770> right<00:03:32.770> now<00:03:32.980> is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
one point three gigahertz right now is

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.190 
one point three gigahertz right now is
pointing<00:03:33.610> one<00:03:33.760> between<00:03:34.270> 1.3<00:03:34.870> kickers<00:03:35.170> and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
pointing one between 1.3 kickers and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.840 
pointing one between 1.3 kickers and
hundred<00:03:35.740> megahertz<00:03:35.980> because<00:03:36.430> when<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.700> don't

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
hundred megahertz because when you don't

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.910 
hundred megahertz because when you don't
need<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.180> much<00:03:37.390> power<00:03:37.600> will<00:03:37.920> automatically

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
need that much power will automatically

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.690 
need that much power will automatically
scaled<00:03:39.280> down<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:42.750> let<00:03:43.750> me<00:03:43.840> show<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.490> let's<00:03:45.490> run

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
scaled down so let me show you let's run

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.470 
scaled down so let me show you let's run
linpack<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> i<00:03:47.590> was<00:03:47.740> getting<00:03:47.950> like<00:03:48.070> 13<00:03:48.580> without

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
linpack so i was getting like 13 without

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.020 
linpack so i was getting like 13 without
it<00:03:49.900> overclocked<00:03:50.470> let's<00:03:50.920> see<00:03:51.040> what<00:03:51.160> i<00:03:51.190> get<00:03:51.280> with

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
it overclocked let's see what i get with

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.960 
it overclocked let's see what i get with
it<00:03:52.090> overclocked<00:03:52.870> wow<00:03:53.560> look<00:03:53.770> at<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.910> I've

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
it overclocked wow look at that so I've

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.060 
it overclocked wow look at that so I've
got<00:03:55.180> 17<00:03:55.720> instead<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.170> 13<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.800> that's

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
got 17 instead of 13 so that's

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.960 
got 17 instead of 13 so that's
definitely<00:03:57.630> about<00:03:58.630> twenty<00:03:59.110> thirty<00:03:59.350> percent

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
definitely about twenty thirty percent

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.160 
definitely about twenty thirty percent

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
that and I can set it to performance

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.370 
that and I can set it to performance
then<00:04:48.670> it's<00:04:48.850> going<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.060> be<00:04:49.120> always<00:04:49.330> at<00:04:49.510> thirteen

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
then it's going to be always at thirteen

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.990 
then it's going to be always at thirteen
hundred<00:04:50.530> megahertz<00:04:50.830> let<00:04:51.550> me<00:04:51.640> see<00:04:51.700> if<00:04:51.820> that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
hundred megahertz let me see if that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.640 
hundred megahertz let me see if that
makes<00:04:52.210> any<00:04:52.330> difference<00:04:52.840> with<00:04:53.200> blimp<00:04:53.440> pack

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
makes any difference with blimp pack

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.530 
makes any difference with blimp pack
probably<00:04:54.310> won't<00:04:54.490> because<00:04:55.360> it's

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
probably won't because it's

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.660 
probably won't because it's
automatically<00:04:56.200> scaling<00:04:56.740> earlier<00:04:57.040> but<00:04:57.580> who

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
automatically scaling earlier but who

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.980 
automatically scaling earlier but who
knows<00:04:59.070> yeah<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.520> about<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.790> same<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.750> just

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
knows yeah it's about the same so just

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.950 
knows yeah it's about the same so just
set<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.140> on<00:05:02.350> for<00:05:03.010> on-demand<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.600> doesn't

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
set it on for on-demand so it doesn't

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.350 
set it on for on-demand so it doesn't
drain<00:05:05.440> your<00:05:05.560> battery<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.640> now<00:05:06.820> you've<00:05:07.060> got

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
drain your battery but now you've got

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.060 
drain your battery but now you've got
you<00:05:07.870> know<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.740> maximum<00:05:09.280> speed<00:05:09.520> out<00:05:09.850> of<00:05:09.880> your

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
you know the maximum speed out of your

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.490 
you know the maximum speed out of your
your<00:05:12.390> epic<00:05:13.390> 4g<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:14.590> see<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.830> later<00:05:14.860> thanks
