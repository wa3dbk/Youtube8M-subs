00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.619
 the difficulty for me is to get into this moment of writing 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.750
 but once I got back she did it for one hundred 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.650
 that's how we can not do more than we need people go out so I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.539
 go to the end 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.509
 and that's why it can be 12 hours 15 hours a day 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.599
 I only think about it that I was there I become a writer 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.810
 but the rest of the time not 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.619
 and so all that is difficult is 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.399
 because these powerful a woman 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.039
 obviously it's not work at the burial mine all proportions 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.560
 guarded which obviously 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.180
 to go for things in itself 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 and get them back up 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.620
 it's a job it's a real work on oneself 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.850
 it's a job that was not involved very tiring and so 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.580
 I write 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.680
 very easily because I know what I'm going to do 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540
 but the moment I decide to do it I recoil is more precise because 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.480
 that I know it's going to be 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.080
 a Bordeaux and it will take me Savannah Savannah emptied this is something 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.809
 who guides me 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.040
 so I can not do that 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.129
 I do not publish a day at all the years for example I can not do 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.310
 that the writer 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.390
 but here it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 that in the time of writing 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 I am writer only when I write there she that you see me I 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.870
 am not a writer 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.280
 I followed smeared 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.670
 I am the writer's representative I am 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.080
 the lawyer of the writer I am perhaps the one who is jealous 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 writer 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 good maybe that but I'm not a writer 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.740
 I'm only a writer that I write because that's where a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.899
 thought that does not belong 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.040
 that so much of writing 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.430
 and that does not exist anywhere else and it was this time of writing it does not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 is manifested more at that moment she 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.050
 I think the purpose some way 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.410
 there is no evidence 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.310
 the closest people to writers 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.950
 there is no writer because we are writing this mandate when 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 we are talking 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.690
 I write these lines when 40-year-old gervinho 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.400
 the forty years I lived 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.730
 Where is 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.080
 for 100 m the book tells what I lived and survived it turns out that 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 since then the thing that I have a family 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.280
 very weird and very particular 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 % to brother 6% here is the disenchanted image 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.919
 the idea of ​​the book every time and in every book c 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.019
 things happen in reality 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 and we finally understand as soon as we start to look at them we do not understand 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:17.969
 what does she mean 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.689
 and they especially challenge to tell them 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.010
 that is to say, you meet a woman you fall in love with her you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.849
 have a story she's leaving where you're going 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.609
 and what happened could not tell the thing just like that but 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.449
 if you really want to tell the story 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.329
 you're forced to ask but why this woman what was 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.059
 past 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.080
 e 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.249
 where do the feelings come from is it just on the surface me what is it 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.299
 much deeper and spa other things 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.449
 and so for all my work is to try 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.639
 to be atzeur's skin in writing what's going on in the 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.639
 reality 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.959
 in the fight and mysterious to add a layer the break with a 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.599
 woman with whom I lived and who will leave 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.859
 overnight without saying anything the range not one but two ruptures 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.419
 carrie ann had it all 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.399
 for 100 m me it made me a little crazy anyway m and years later 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.969
 she noted the phones 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.699
 while I had no news of her during the game three four years 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.319
 el-ahmed phone to ask me to be the mystery guest to a 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.589
 birthday party 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.209
 by sophie calle 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.309
 and these crazy is just crazy but I want me to say to myself but I do not understand 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.599
 how this woman 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.379
 kim liked that i loved with whom we are a very strong story 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.489
 who's gone from my life the call just for that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.780
 and so I go to this birthday party 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.599
 with the idea of ​​elucidating 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.379
 this woman's behavior is to understand 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.359
 why why is she looking alas this way of knowing 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.529
 it was to go the birthday fefa 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:47.680
 heller i did well since i managed to elucidate the reason for being 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.680
 de dede of his behavior 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.599
 in fact I had never spoken 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.839
 exposure take care of yourself 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.469
 because I consider that and the execution of his daughters a few months 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.619
 I wrote an email do and it was an exclusivity to paraty that it was 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.729
 the first time we meet 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:10.889
 publicly 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.679
 on his work 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.539
 and I think there will never be another seven-year encounter because 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.969
 it's a unique moment 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.199
 me it's important because I wanted to see how I behaved 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.060
 compared to that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.120
 what did he have to say too 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.990
 and here is the meeting took place I think it's a unique moment he had 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.490
 place in brazil and paraty and so here it is beautiful and miracle 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.240
 never again meeting that order me what happened a person that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.069
 I really like 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.259
 obviously I do not agree with this exhibition there in particular and 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.080
 with the intention 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.860
 with expulsion is with the intention is what she is proud to do 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.360
 but I have always painted a lot of pain 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.099
 and I still love him and I think I'd like him all the time 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.479
 so we stayed very very complices clk been abandoned when 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.379
 the love story this arrested 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.840
 so we did not see each other for a long time until 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.850
 khalfa his exhibition hugo or there obviously we were forced to 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.689
 meet again 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.499
 and at first it was a little normal like that 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.629
 and then% and then we saw that we became friends and I think we are friends 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.629
 now 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.139
 the audience he was 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.569
 because yes the public could have sent waves for this is a match 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.699
 and in fact they sent people who were very positive very 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:22.689
 generous 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.629
 and so suddenly we could not fight because it was not 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.360
 no place to be 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.770
 at the same time we are proud to say mounier things about work 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.530
 artistic beyond the context that was a bit peculiar 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.530
 it was not really a match that land m 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.470
 put things back in balance and the thing that's important to me I 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.930
 am invited here as a writer 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.680
 it was to say that it was the same as the mail of a writer and then after 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.999
 see how does sophie's work get organized 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.060
 and mine 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.060
 and what are the differences 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.309
 first I'm waiting for you not to expose myself too much but at the same time I know 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.529
 that it's part of 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.150
 in fact hurt the question of privacy the tournament arises not exactly what 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.479
 term it's not just there are private things and public things 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.579
 when the privacy and the material with which I write my 

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:13.539
 stories 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.619
 e 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:18.029
 for me intimacy is interiority which is really 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.600
 tignes for me is the interiority 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.490
 Emilie drunk I tell to simply intimate things 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.380
 I tell it of the interiority and that is the most precious for me 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.189
 so 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.909
 the question we were not going to know if it's a sluggish and public team 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.119
 I think it's a fake finally when you're a writer when you're 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.659
 artist 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.310
 that's not the question the question is is the conspiracy enough of 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.639
 to bring something inside 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.749
 in relation to situations and whether they are private or public 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:42.539
 it is important
