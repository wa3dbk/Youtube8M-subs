compensation<00:01:42.570> point<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:42.960> view<00:01:43.080> but<00:01:43.230> this<00:01:43.350> one

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
compensation point of view but this one

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.930 
compensation point of view but this one
is<00:01:43.590> quite<00:01:43.800> exceptional<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.790> amount

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
is quite exceptional because the amount

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.190 
is quite exceptional because the amount
of<00:01:45.090> wind<00:01:45.270> flow<00:01:45.480> we<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:45.870> pass

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of wind flow we can actually pass

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
of wind flow we can actually pass
through<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.800> keep<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.670> planted

the<00:01:53.490> pole<00:01:53.729> system<00:01:53.970> enables<00:01:54.510> is<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.870> sort<00:01:55.050> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the pole system enables is to sort of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
the pole system enables is to sort of
become<00:01:55.440> free<00:01:55.710> standing<00:01:56.160> out<00:01:56.250> here<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.520> bit

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
become free standing out here a bit

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.630

which<00:01:56.880> means<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.210> best

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
which means the best

which means the best
headroom<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.710> again<00:01:59.710> another<00:01:59.920> entrance<00:02:00.460> so

now i'm going to show you around the
edges<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.710> tent<00:02:02.979> just<00:02:03.280> give<00:02:03.400> it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430
