00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.690
 the stadium of the lack 90 with a new 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.610
 video and also on this occasion 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.200
 I advance and I decided the truth I saw it 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.119
 I really liked it, I wanted to share it with 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.770
 we are going to see them we have a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
 option that is the spotlight that is something 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.430
 very similar to what is in x for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.109
 can search files many of us 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.500
 We really do not use it or we do not 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.420
 we occupy and well that what it does is 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 put this on our exposes for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.949
 can make it a little more useful 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 that is called task master and the truth 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.120
 he is very father as they can in the part 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 superior we can modify what is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.960
 our song that is playing in those 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 moments we can configure what is the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 sound we can also combine what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.629
 is the brightness the brightness intensity 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 our wifi put in Friday mode 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.930
 our device the mourning of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.910
 turn it on 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.410
 or the option not to disturb these 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 new options to be able to make a tweet 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.039
 put this some status on facebook all 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.440
 works perfectly the truth is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.780
 very father did not want to send a tweet 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.250
 just pressed this and how can 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 see the interface to be able to send a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 tweet and likewise works for what 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's facebook and also if we want 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.909
 send for example an email we can 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.210
 how can you see the other information the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.220
 which is very interesting as the name 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 device the type of platform that is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.350
 capacity storage capacity 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.490
 available storage the network of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.619
 that we are connected good the truth 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.939
 is very father is tweet I like it a lot 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.830
 has no configuration options or 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.299
 nothing but I think it's a tweet that's 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.400
 very very well done and a very good 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.860
 function something that we hardly use 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 good seems friends as there is always 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.040
 to enter Syria and what to expect 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.360
 that finished loading or that ready since 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.619

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.720

 top this has a cost of 99 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.920
 cents in the network we can say already and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.860
