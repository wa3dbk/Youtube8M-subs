think<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.050> problem<00:03:11.470> was<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:13.300> in

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
think the problem was that that in

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.140 
think the problem was that that in
dealing<00:03:13.780> with<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.470> issue<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.400> peace<00:03:15.820> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
dealing with the issue of peace and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.200 
dealing with the issue of peace and
between<00:03:16.570> Israel<00:03:16.990> and<00:03:17.050> Egypt<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.210> Carter

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
between Israel and Egypt the Carter

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.610 
between Israel and Egypt the Carter
Center<00:03:19.450> has<00:03:19.510> taken<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> very<00:03:20.050> strong<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
Center has taken a very strong and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.650 
Center has taken a very strong and
public<00:03:20.950> position<00:03:21.460> of<00:03:21.610> equal<00:03:22.450> treatment

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
public position of equal treatment

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.140 
public position of equal treatment
between<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.320> Palestinians<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.310> Israelis

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
between the Palestinians and Israelis

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.590 
between the Palestinians and Israelis
and<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.840> think<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.230> was<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> sensitive<00:03:26.830> area<00:03:27.760> in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
and I think this was a sensitive area in

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.410 
and I think this was a sensitive area in
which<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.290> president<00:03:29.860> ought<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:29.980> be<00:03:30.420> involved

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
which the president ought to be involved

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.570 
which the president ought to be involved
when<00:03:32.320> he<00:03:32.410> first<00:03:32.620> came<00:03:32.830> out<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:33.250> his<00:03:33.340> speech

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
when he first came out with his speech

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.130 
when he first came out with his speech
in<00:03:33.760> Cairo<00:03:33.970> called<00:03:34.420> him<00:03:34.510> for<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.720> end<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.990> all

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
in Cairo called him for the end of all

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.660 
in Cairo called him for the end of all
settlements<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:35.860> who<00:03:35.950> any<00:03:36.160> later<00:03:36.340> said<00:03:36.640> that

settlements and who any later said that

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.030 
settlements and who any later said that
the<00:03:36.820> 67<00:03:37.450> borders<00:03:37.600> would<00:03:37.870> prevail<00:03:38.200> he<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:38.920> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
the 67 borders would prevail he and I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.800 
the 67 borders would prevail he and I
