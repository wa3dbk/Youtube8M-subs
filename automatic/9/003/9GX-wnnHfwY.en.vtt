00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
get my ideas in maybe that games already

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
get my ideas in maybe that games already
and<00:00:28.830> produced<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.539> wanted<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.009> share

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and produced but I just wanted to share

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
and produced but I just wanted to share
what<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> next<00:00:34.230> game<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
what I I like see in the next game the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.420 
what I I like see in the next game the
first<00:00:35.250> touch<00:00:35.640> feature<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:37.250> should<00:00:38.250> be

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
first touch feature I think should be

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.650 
first touch feature I think should be
used<00:00:39.210> i<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.989> press<00:00:40.260> r1<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.850> r2<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
used i know you can press r1 and r2 and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
used i know you can press r1 and r2 and
right<00:00:43.500> analog<00:00:44.010> stick<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:44.850> M<00:00:45.890> it's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
right analog stick but I think M it's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
right analog stick but I think M it's
very<00:00:47.100> stiff<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.149> drops<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> ball<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
very stiff and it just drops the ball I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.069 
very stiff and it just drops the ball I
think<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.500> should<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:49.800> free-flowing<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
think it should be more free-flowing and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.220 
think it should be more free-flowing and
just<00:00:52.079> flick<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.710> analog<00:00:53.039> stick<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
just flick the right analog stick for a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.479 
just flick the right analog stick for a
first<00:00:55.230> touch<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> next<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> way

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
first touch and next thing now the way

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.750 
first touch and next thing now the way
of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.730> ball<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.760> physics

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of the ball I think they got the physics

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.050 
of the ball I think they got the physics
about<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> players<00:01:05.760> seem

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
about right there but the players seem

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
about right there but the players seem
to<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.299> weighed<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:07.110> heavily<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to be weighed down very heavily to the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850 
to be weighed down very heavily to the
ground<00:01:08.250> maybe<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.470> have<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
ground maybe that's just my have you on

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.250 
ground maybe that's just my have you on
it<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.760> i<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> player<00:01:13.229> should

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it now but I'm i think the player should

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.490 
it now but I'm i think the player should
move<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.340> freely<00:01:14.790> perhaps<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> then

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
move a bit more freely perhaps and then

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
move a bit more freely perhaps and then
yeah<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:17.640> I'd<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.540> had

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
yeah that's why I'd like to see I had

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
yeah that's why I'd like to see I had
the<00:01:19.320> passing<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.979> stuff<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:21.150> okay<00:01:21.600> yeah<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the passing and stuff it's okay yeah I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
the passing and stuff it's okay yeah I
guess<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.450> shootings<00:01:24.450> been<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> problem

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
guess but an shootings been a problem

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
guess but an shootings been a problem
for<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.590> ever<00:01:26.130> since<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.640> started<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:27.210> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
for me ever since I started with this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.830 
for me ever since I started with this
game<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.460> previous<00:01:29.460> ones<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.119> wasn't<00:01:30.479> too<00:01:30.600> bad

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
game and previous ones it wasn't too bad

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.460 
game and previous ones it wasn't too bad
but<00:01:32.060> yeah<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.299> tend<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> middle

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
but yeah they tend to go down the middle

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.789 
but yeah they tend to go down the middle
if<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:34.829> using<00:01:35.040> any<00:01:35.430> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> weak<00:01:36.390> player

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
if you're using any kind of weak player

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
if you're using any kind of weak player
unless<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:38.040> using<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> best<00:01:38.909> teams

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
unless you're using one the best teams

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260 
unless you're using one the best teams
your<00:01:39.509> shots<00:01:39.810> go<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.650> middle<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
your shots go down the middle and if you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
your shots go down the middle and if you
do<00:01:42.509> manage<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> side

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
do manage get them to the side

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
do manage get them to the side
goalkeepers<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.850> always<00:01:45.180> let<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
goalkeepers will always let them in so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
goalkeepers will always let them in so
that's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.680> problem<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.180> current

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's a problem I think in the current

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.620 
that's a problem I think in the current
game<00:01:48.829> now<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.310> move<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> game<00:01:51.030> modes<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
game now just move on to game modes and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.550 
game now just move on to game modes and
yeah<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:53.549> football<00:01:54.180> life<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
yeah so for football life I think that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.179 
yeah so for football life I think that
they<00:01:55.740> should<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.930> either<00:01:58.189> manager

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
they should have just an either manager

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.170 
they should have just an either manager
mode<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.670> become<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> legend<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.969> for

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
mode or become a legend and you have for

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.520 
mode or become a legend and you have for
manager<00:02:03.540> mode<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.110> create<00:02:04.380> your

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
manager mode you just create your

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
manager mode you just create your
manager<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> should<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.299> able

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
manager I think that you should be able

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.400 
manager I think that you should be able
to<00:02:06.750> either<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.759> manage<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.970> national<00:02:09.810> team<00:02:10.080> or

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
to either and manage a national team or

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.780 
to either and manage a national team or
a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.589 
a
a<00:02:11.870> club<00:02:12.870> team<00:02:13.110> or<00:02:13.469> even<00:02:14.040> both<00:02:14.219> which<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.329> like

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
a club team or even both which I like

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.250 
a club team or even both which I like
see<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.079> for<00:02:16.980> become<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> legend<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:19.109> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
see and for become a legend I think that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.809 
see and for become a legend I think that
you<00:02:19.379> should<00:02:19.409> have<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.069> create<00:02:20.340> everything

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
you should have to create everything

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.000 
you should have to create everything
from<00:02:21.000> scratch<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.840> create<00:02:22.349> I'll<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.890> what

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
from scratch you create I'll see what

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
from scratch you create I'll see what
your<00:02:23.189> player<00:02:23.430> looks<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.939> but<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
your player looks like but I think you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.720 
your player looks like but I think you
should<00:02:25.469> have<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.829> create<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.340> name<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:28.409> M

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
should have to create the name of your M

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
should have to create the name of your M
the<00:02:29.730> team<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.030> he<00:02:30.329> starts<00:02:30.720> off<00:02:30.870> playing<00:02:31.230> for

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the team that he starts off playing for

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.960 
the team that he starts off playing for
like<00:02:31.859> just<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.519> random<00:02:33.359> club<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.790> have

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
like just a random club and a you have

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.240 
like just a random club and a you have
you<00:02:36.359> just<00:02:36.569> get<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.170> fake<00:02:37.500> players<00:02:37.859> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you just get all these fake players and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.629 
you just get all these fake players and
you<00:02:39.120> customize<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.870> jerseys<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.980> small

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
you customize the jerseys and a small

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.410 
you customize the jerseys and a small
Stadium<00:02:42.150> etc<00:02:43.010> I'll<00:02:44.010> talk<00:02:44.549> more<00:02:44.609> about<00:02:44.939> why<00:02:45.389> I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
Stadium etc I'll talk more about why I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740 
Stadium etc I'll talk more about why I
see<00:02:46.139> that<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.879> play<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.720> or

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
see that but then I'm you play one or

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.629 
see that but then I'm you play one or
two<00:02:48.900> matches<00:02:49.409> maybe<00:02:49.650> for<00:02:49.919> them<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.519> you

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
two matches maybe for them and then you

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.270 
two matches maybe for them and then you
get<00:02:50.790> scouted<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:52.049> why<00:02:52.230> I'd<00:02:52.409> like<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.739> see<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
get scouted but why I'd like to see that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.000 
get scouted but why I'd like to see that
you<00:02:54.150> create<00:02:54.540> everything<00:02:55.109> from<00:02:55.319> scratch<00:02:55.709> at

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you create everything from scratch at

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.080 
you create everything from scratch at
start<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.870> because<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:59.310> an<00:02:59.459> idea<00:02:59.609> it's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
start is because I have an idea it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.140 
start is because I have an idea it's
kind<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.359> like<00:03:00.480> pro<00:03:00.750> clubs<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.260> FIFA<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.859> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
kind of like pro clubs and FIFA but I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
kind of like pro clubs and FIFA but I
called<00:03:03.150> sunday<00:03:03.689> league<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.200> something<00:03:04.799> where

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
called sunday league or something where

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.839 
called sunday league or something where
you<00:03:05.579> adjust<00:03:05.879> them<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:07.650> basically<00:03:08.159> like<00:03:08.489> a

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
you adjust them it's basically like a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.740 
you adjust them it's basically like a
regular<00:03:09.540> sunday<00:03:10.379> league<00:03:10.680> match<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.909> your

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.920 
regular sunday league match for your
home<00:03:12.989> team<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.519> completely<00:03:14.909> wait<00:03:15.450> by

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
home team and you completely wait by

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.869 
home team and you completely wait by
yourself<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.889> can<00:03:17.069> only<00:03:17.190> control<00:03:17.459> your

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
yourself you can only control your

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.479

player<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.510> line<00:03:18.780> up<00:03:19.229> against<00:03:19.650> our<00:03:19.829> teams<00:03:20.159> and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
player on line up against our teams and

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.990 
player on line up against our teams and
you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.810> also<00:03:21.989> invite<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:23.340> friends<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.819> play

you can also invite your friends to play

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.119 
you can also invite your friends to play
along<00:03:24.329> with<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.989> your<00:03:25.049> team<00:03:25.560> only

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
controlling your own legends and so

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
controlling your own legends and so
people<00:03:32.129> wouldn't<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.760> same<00:03:33.120> teams<00:03:33.389> like

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
people wouldn't have the same teams like

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.490 
people wouldn't have the same teams like
if<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.949> pick<00:03:35.220> Chelsea<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:35.940> your<00:03:36.150> team<00:03:36.500> then

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
if you pick Chelsea as your team then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.259 
if you pick Chelsea as your team then
you're<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.069> going<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.579> playing<00:03:38.790> whole

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you're just going to be playing whole

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.719 
you're just going to be playing whole
lot<00:03:39.449> of<00:03:39.569> professional<00:03:40.169> teams<00:03:41.040> which<00:03:41.310> won't<00:03:41.579> be

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
lot of professional teams which won't be

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.990 
lot of professional teams which won't be
as<00:03:41.849> fun<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.829> then<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.859> am<00:03:44.069> moving<00:03:44.549> quickly

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
as fun I think then I am moving quickly

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.520 
as fun I think then I am moving quickly
on<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.739> think<00:03:47.299> perhaps<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.690> create<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.049> skill

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
on and I think perhaps it create a skill

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.000 
on and I think perhaps it create a skill
move<00:03:50.030> my<00:03:51.030> pico<00:03:51.449> feature<00:03:51.750> as<00:03:52.109> well<00:03:52.139> for<00:03:52.739> your

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
move my pico feature as well for your

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
move my pico feature as well for your
become<00:03:53.579> legend<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.239> then<00:03:54.389> this<00:03:55.139> girl<00:03:55.379> move

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
become legend and then this girl move

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.000 
become legend and then this girl move
could<00:03:55.799> be<00:03:55.919> easily<00:03:56.159> triggered<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:58.010> maybe

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
could be easily triggered and maybe

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.129 
could be easily triggered and maybe
that'd<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.340> too<00:03:59.639> complicated<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:00.389> just<00:04:00.720> if

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
that'd be too complicated but just if

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.319 
that'd be too complicated but just if
you<00:04:01.349> could<00:04:01.379> add<00:04:01.709> put<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> chain<00:04:02.699> of<00:04:02.760> different

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
you could add put a chain of different

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.240 
you could add put a chain of different
faint<00:04:03.599> moves<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.139> stepovers<00:04:04.799> together

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
faint moves and stepovers together

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.300 
faint moves and stepovers together
without<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.540> over<00:04:06.989> complication<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.859> having

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
without the over complication of having

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.189 
without the over complication of having
to<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.759> in<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.909> match<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.359> like<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.019> that

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
to do it in a match I like to see that

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.879 
to do it in a match I like to see that
and<00:04:10.519> then<00:04:11.519> maybe<00:04:12.030> classic<00:04:12.629> games<00:04:12.900> where<00:04:13.859> they

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
and then maybe classic games where they

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.779 
and then maybe classic games where they
have<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.340> actual<00:04:14.519> teams<00:04:15.120> from<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.789> maybe

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.469

or not and then for master league online
I<00:04:37.750> think<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:38.830> should<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.099> able<00:04:39.250> to

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
I think that you should be able to

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.719 
I think that you should be able to
customize<00:04:42.090> like<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:44.650> could<00:04:44.889> use<00:04:44.919> maybe<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
customize like you could use maybe a

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.540 
customize like you could use maybe a
Chelsea<00:04:46.449> home<00:04:46.659> jersey<00:04:47.199> real<00:04:47.470> madrid<00:04:47.919> away<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
Chelsea home jersey real madrid away and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.589 
Chelsea home jersey real madrid away and
then<00:04:49.319> AC<00:04:50.319> milan<00:04:51.030> crest<00:04:52.030> or<00:04:52.240> something<00:04:52.509> like

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
then AC milan crest or something like

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.469 
then AC milan crest or something like
that<00:04:52.659> and<00:04:52.870> different<00:04:53.650> stadium<00:04:54.090> just<00:04:55.090> out<00:04:55.270> be<00:04:55.449> a

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
that and different stadium just out be a

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.439 
that and different stadium just out be a
good<00:04:55.720> feature<00:04:55.960> i<00:04:56.169> think<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.800> i<00:04:57.789> think<00:04:58.360> you

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
good feature i think and i think you

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.089 
good feature i think and i think you
should<00:04:58.479> start<00:04:58.900> off<00:04:59.050> with<00:04:59.319> all<00:04:59.469> real<00:04:59.740> players

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
should start off with all real players

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.600 
should start off with all real players
like<00:05:01.030> decent<00:05:01.509> players<00:05:01.960> may<00:05:02.289> be<00:05:02.370> ready<00:05:03.370> around

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
like decent players may be ready around

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.740 
like decent players may be ready around
70<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.599> i<00:05:05.229> think<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.710> if<00:05:06.460> they're<00:05:07.389> gonna<00:05:07.539> be

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
70 and i think that if they're gonna be

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.399 
70 and i think that if they're gonna be
