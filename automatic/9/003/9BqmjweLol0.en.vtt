Hi Guys this is Jasmina

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.500
of weblogit.net at the Gamescom 2013

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.400
I just experienced the Oculus Rift for the first time

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
which is a VR head-mounted display.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
I gave Portal 2 a try in VR

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
standing on the "Cyberith Virtualizer",

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.000
a VR platform that you use together with

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
ballerina shoes and special socks

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
while being strapped to the control ring at your waist
(reminiscent of climbing gear)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
all of which serving the purpose of translating 
my movements to the game

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
while my feet slid across the baseplate

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in order to propel me forwards
(or backwards) in this digital world

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500
I was warned that I might experience motion/simulator sickness

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.400
as there is a disparity between the mind and the senses in VR

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
but apparently I am a VR-natural. ;)

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.500
My task was to pick up and carry this cube from

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
one place to another, whilst actually walking and using an elevator

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
until I could finally set it down at its destination.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.600
I must admit that this was quite an amusing matter,
causing more than one laughing fit

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.500
The Virtuix "Omni" competitor model works quite differently (= passive treadmill, using ridges)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the Cyberith Virtualizer appears to be a more ergonomic experience, as it provides a surface to stand on naturally, without the slope

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.600
overall the experience is tough to describe, perhaps comparable to inline skating

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.400
or to walking on a very slippery surface as ice

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
but probably the best way to experience it, will be to try it yourself.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:07.200
We very much enjoyed our quick trial of the Cyberith Virtualizer and are amped to try the HD Rift at the neighbouring stand. See you there!
