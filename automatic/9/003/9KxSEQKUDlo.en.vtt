you're<00:00:54.660> capable<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> spinning<00:00:55.649> up

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you're capable of a spinning up

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
you're capable of a spinning up
basically<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.809> arrived

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
basically so then this is just arrived

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.510 
basically so then this is just arrived
so<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:58.500> review<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:59.039> come<00:00:59.250> once<00:00:59.399> I've<00:00:59.489> had

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so my review will come once I've had

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
so my review will come once I've had
time<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> test<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.390> box<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.750> actually

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
time to test it this box is actually

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
time to test it this box is actually
still<00:01:01.230> sealed<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.949> everything<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.489> thought

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
still sealed up and everything I thought

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.920 
still sealed up and everything I thought
I<00:01:02.730> might<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> bit<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.690> unboxing

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I might as well do a bit of an unboxing

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
I might as well do a bit of an unboxing
because<00:01:04.260> people<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.309> excited

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because people are very very excited

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.859 
because people are very very excited
about<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.000> quick<00:01:06.210> look<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> tech<00:01:06.659> specs

about this quick look at the tech specs

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.910 
about this quick look at the tech specs
on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> side<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> box<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.740> got<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
on the side of the box it's got a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.350 
on the side of the box it's got a
hardware<00:01:08.400> encoder<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.000> means<00:01:09.240> your

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hardware encoder which means your

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.490 
hardware encoder which means your
computer<00:01:09.600> doesn't<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> heavy

I<00:01:24.210> hate<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:24.869> past<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> talked<00:01:25.560> about

I hate in my past so we talked about

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
I hate in my past so we talked about
that<00:01:25.920> already<00:01:26.250> recording<00:01:26.970> rate<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.240> 1<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> 12

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that already recording rate from 1 to 12

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
that already recording rate from 1 to 12
megabits<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.140> second<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.180> prioritize

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
megabits a second so you can prioritize

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.440 
megabits a second so you can prioritize
other<00:01:30.450> quality<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.140> recording<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.640> blah

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
other quality or recording time and blah

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I have to be careful with this because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
I have to be careful with this because
it<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.780> low<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.170> unit<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.440> actually

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
it is just a low in a unit that actually

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.020

have<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.010> send<00:02:35.250> back<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> don't<00:02:35.850> want<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
have to send back so I don't want to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.490 
have to send back so I don't want to
destroy<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> box<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.870> time<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.410> with

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
destroy the box this time like I do with

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.430 
destroy the box this time like I do with
my<00:02:37.650> Nexus<00:02:37.980> 7<00:02:38.010> unboxing<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:39.420> look<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.110> cable

output cables for xbox and ps3 and so we

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.160 
output cables for xbox and ps3 and so we
build<00:03:03.000> what's<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> things<00:03:03.450> three<00:03:03.840> different

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
build what's the things three different

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.810 
build what's the things three different
outputs<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.010> cable<00:03:05.340> very<00:03:05.519> very

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
outputs there in one cable very very

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.240 
outputs there in one cable very very
handy<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.870> little<00:03:10.170> ps3<00:03:10.739> component

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
output cables there as well so you can

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.229

oh I need that cable and they didn't put
it<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> box<00:03:56.730> nothing<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:58.110> nature<00:03:58.500> so

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
it in the box nothing of that nature so

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.630 
it in the box nothing of that nature so
as<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.640> see<00:03:59.820> the<00:04:00.540> design<00:04:00.840> has<00:04:01.110> been<00:04:01.640> it's

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
as you can see the design has been it's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.920 
as you can see the design has been it's
much<00:04:02.790> more<00:04:02.970> elegant<00:04:03.420> than<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.570> original<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
much more elegant than the original and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.479 
much more elegant than the original and
the<00:04:04.049> original<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.380> was<00:04:04.440> quite<00:04:04.650> boxy<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.280> its

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
the original one was quite boxy in its

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.280 
the original one was quite boxy in its
design<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.970> was<00:04:06.090> literally<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.840> box<00:04:07.110> about

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
design it was literally just a box about

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.050 
design it was literally just a box about
the<00:04:07.620> size<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:08.010> Mac<00:04:08.130> Mini<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.430> guess<00:04:08.700> pretty

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
the size of a Mac Mini I guess pretty

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.670 
the size of a Mac Mini I guess pretty
much<00:04:09.269> exactly<00:04:09.540> what<00:04:09.750> you'd<00:04:09.989> expect<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
much exactly what you'd expect on the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.560 
much exactly what you'd expect on the
back<00:04:10.859> panel<00:04:11.040> you've<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.430> your<00:04:11.579> HDMI<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.359> for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
back panel you've got your HDMI in for

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.539 
back panel you've got your HDMI in for
going<00:04:12.810> into<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.200> unit<00:04:13.410> HDMI<00:04:13.890> out<00:04:14.100> for<00:04:14.340> getting

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
going into the unit HDMI out for getting

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.890 
going into the unit HDMI out for getting
out<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.880> unit<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.390> course<00:04:15.570> that's<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
out of the unit and of course that's the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.020 
out of the unit and of course that's the
lag<00:04:16.260> free<00:04:16.739> connection<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.519> spits<00:04:17.850> out

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
lag free connection that spits out

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.029 
lag free connection that spits out
directly<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.229> doesn't<00:04:19.590> make<00:04:19.709> your<00:04:19.829> video

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
directly so it doesn't make your video

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.130 
directly so it doesn't make your video
game<00:04:20.250> lag<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:20.880> gameplay<00:04:21.539> isn't<00:04:21.930> impacted

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
go a nice soft blue glow around the bar

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.280 
go a nice soft blue glow around the bar
there<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.330> don't<00:04:48.420> know<00:04:48.630> why<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.810> doesn't<00:04:49.110> go<00:04:49.170> all

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
there I don't know why it doesn't go all

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.570 
there I don't know why it doesn't go all
the<00:04:49.350> way<00:04:49.410> around<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.860> thought<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.190> might<00:04:50.370> but

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the way around I thought it might but

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.250 
the way around I thought it might but
apparently<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> doesn't<00:04:51.180> oh<00:04:51.510> yeah<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.200> the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
apparently it doesn't oh yeah with the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.570 
apparently it doesn't oh yeah with the
lights<00:04:52.410> back<00:04:52.560> on<00:04:52.710> we<00:04:52.830> can<00:04:52.980> see<00:04:53.130> properly<00:04:53.430> again

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
lights back on we can see properly again

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.430 
lights back on we can see properly again
and<00:04:53.790> underneath<00:04:54.120> we<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.300> see<00:04:54.510> lots<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.140> lots

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
and underneath we can see lots and lots

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.810 
and underneath we can see lots and lots
and<00:04:55.620> lots<00:04:55.950> of<00:04:56.070> little<00:04:56.250> holes<00:04:56.340> for<00:04:56.790> ventilation

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
and lots of little holes for ventilation

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.630 
and lots of little holes for ventilation
because<00:04:57.750> video<00:04:58.650> encoding<00:04:59.160> does<00:04:59.340> tend<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
because video encoding does tend to

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.130 
because video encoding does tend to
generate<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.030> lot<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.240> heat<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.870> when<00:05:00.990> you're

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
generate a lot of heat and when you're

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.380 
generate a lot of heat and when you're
doing<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.500> for<00:05:01.710> up<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.640> half<00:05:02.850> an<00:05:02.970> hour<00:05:03.090> or<00:05:03.240> more

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
doing it for up to half an hour or more

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.580 
doing it for up to half an hour or more
at<00:05:03.480> time<00:05:03.660> when<00:05:03.810> you're<00:05:03.930> recording<00:05:04.110> extended

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
at time when you're recording extended

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.260 
at time when you're recording extended
gameplay<00:05:04.980> stuff<00:05:05.280> that's<00:05:05.520> really<00:05:05.730> important

gameplay stuff that's really important

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.120

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so all the air gets sucked in there

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.310 
so all the air gets sucked in there
there<00:05:08.280> are<00:05:08.310> no<00:05:08.490> fans<00:05:09.210> running<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:10.200> all

there are no fans running this is all

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.800 
there are no fans running this is all

your manual which should go without

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.900 
your manual which should go without
saying<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.620> guess<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:23.070> had<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.220> go<00:05:23.550> with

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
saying but I guess it had to go with

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.700 
saying but I guess it had to go with
saying<00:05:24.300> because<00:05:24.480> this<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.020> an<00:05:25.140> unboxing<00:05:25.380> and
