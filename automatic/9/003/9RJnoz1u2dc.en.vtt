corner<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.240> load<00:01:30.540> them

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
corner and you want to load them

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
corner and you want to load them
down<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.430> command

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
down and then go back to the command

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.859 
down and then go back to the command
blocks<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> type<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
blocks in you're going to type them in

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
blocks in you're going to type them in
so<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:35.040> command<00:01:35.280> block

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so you going to go to your command block

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
so you going to go to your command block
and<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.020> going

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and what you're gonna do is you're going

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
and what you're gonna do is you're going
to<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.439> click<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> again<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.079> /t<00:01:40.079> p

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to right click on it and again i do /t p

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
to right click on it and again i do /t p
10<00:01:40.619> port<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.610> p<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
10 port and then at p and then the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.490 
10 port and then at p and then the
coordinates<00:01:43.500> okay<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
coordinates okay so as you can see you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
coordinates okay so as you can see you
want<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.090> I've<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.299> three<00:01:48.659> gap<00:01:48.840> here

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
want you can see I've got three gap here

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.569 
want you can see I've got three gap here
so<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> white<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.920> goes<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> threes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so the white one that goes up in threes

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.450 
so the white one that goes up in threes
every<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.979> same<00:01:53.189> x

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
every time so it's actually the same x

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.710 
every time so it's actually the same x
coordinates<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.270> set<00:01:54.479> coordinates

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
coordinates and the same set coordinates

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
coordinates and the same set coordinates
in<00:01:55.049> each<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.009> easy<00:01:56.280> kind<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
in each one so it's really easy kind of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
in each one so it's really easy kind of
to<00:01:56.909> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> remember<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.049> they<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.350> add<00:01:58.469> 3

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to kind of remember and they just add 3

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.609 
to kind of remember and they just add 3
to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.890> y<00:01:59.100> coordinate<00:01:59.549> time<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.619> that's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to the y coordinate time so that's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
to the y coordinate time so that's
pretty<00:02:02.100> much<00:02:02.280> everything<00:02:02.460> I've<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> say

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
pretty much everything I've got to say

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
pretty much everything I've got to say
about<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.200> make<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> look<00:02:04.530> more

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
about this you can make it look more

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
about this you can make it look more
fancy<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.640> number<00:02:05.939> system<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.360> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
fancy or you can have number system as I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
fancy or you can have number system as I
said<00:02:06.630> before<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.619> yeah<00:02:07.829> that's<00:02:08.039> pretty<00:02:08.340> much

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
said before and yeah that's pretty much

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.809 
said before and yeah that's pretty much
everything<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:10.229> teleportation<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
everything about this teleportation so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.979 
everything about this teleportation so
there's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> lot<00:02:12.239> more<00:02:12.270> features<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
there's a lot more features about that

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
there's a lot more features about that
