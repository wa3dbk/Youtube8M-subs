00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
all right so come come a long ways in

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.410 
all right so come come a long ways in
these<00:00:03.810> videos<00:00:04.049> we've<00:00:04.830> got<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.819> complete

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
these videos we've got a complete

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.210 
these videos we've got a complete
lifting<00:00:07.020> system<00:00:07.259> we've<00:00:07.620> got<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> complete

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
lifting system we've got a complete

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.950 
lifting system we've got a complete
cradle<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.030> moves<00:00:09.210> left<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.630> right<00:00:09.780> is

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
cradle that moves left and right is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.080 
cradle that moves left and right is
adjustable<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> book<00:00:10.920> we've<00:00:11.790> got<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
adjustable for the book we've got a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.150 
adjustable for the book we've got a
complete<00:00:12.570> LED<00:00:13.110> lighting<00:00:13.320> module<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
complete LED lighting module and a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.010 
complete LED lighting module and a
mostly<00:00:14.790> complete<00:00:15.859> imaging<00:00:16.859> module<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.810> now

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
mostly complete imaging module and now

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
mostly complete imaging module and now
the<00:00:19.080> idea<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.650> put<00:00:19.680> them<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.010> together<00:00:20.510> one

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the idea is to put them all together one

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.910 
the idea is to put them all together one
thing<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> noticed<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.410> standing<00:00:22.800> here

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
thing that I noticed just standing here

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.380 
thing that I noticed just standing here
is<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.519> called<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> front<00:00:24.150> plate

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is that I think I called the front plate

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
is that I think I called the front plate
the<00:00:24.630> back<00:00:25.529> plate<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> back<00:00:26.189> plate<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the back plate in the back plate the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.089 
the back plate in the back plate the
front<00:00:26.789> plate<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.359> might<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.689> on

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
front plate so this might go on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
front plate so this might go on
reversible<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.279> expect<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.060> fortunately<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
reversible you expect but fortunately it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.229 
reversible you expect but fortunately it
only<00:00:31.080> fits<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.560> way<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> basically<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
only fits one way so you basically just

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.860 
only fits one way so you basically just
set<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.140> here<00:00:35.030> as<00:00:36.030> follows<00:00:38.750> one<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
set this thing on here as follows one of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
set this thing on here as follows one of
the<00:00:39.930> features<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.800> talked<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the features that we talked about in the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
the features that we talked about in the
original<00:00:42.030> videos<00:00:42.510> describing<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.140> machine

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
original videos describing this machine

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
original videos describing this machine
was<00:00:43.770> paperback<00:00:44.309> mode<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:45.840> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was paperback mode which is when this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.850 
was paperback mode which is when this
top<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.680> off<00:00:47.149> flips<00:00:48.149> over<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.379> mounts<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
top comes off flips over and mounts in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.290 
top comes off flips over and mounts in
here<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> starts<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.850> removing<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
here and it starts with removing the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
here and it starts with removing the
cradle<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.300> forth<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
cradle and so on and so forth and in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.670 
cradle and so on and so forth and in
these<00:00:56.190> kits<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.789> haven't<00:00:57.149> included<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.809> clamps

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
these kits I haven't included the clamps

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.639 
these kits I haven't included the clamps
that<00:00:59.239> go<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.350> extremely

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that go here because they're extremely

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.139 
that go here because they're extremely
expensive<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.699> we're<00:01:02.820> better

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
expensive and I think we're better

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
expensive and I think we're better
suited<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.049> some<00:01:04.229> pegs<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.040> bolts

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
suited with just some pegs or some bolts

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
suited with just some pegs or some bolts
or<00:01:05.580> even<00:01:05.790> screws<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.780> just

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
or even screws in here that you can just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
or even screws in here that you can just
take<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.350> convert<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.549> paperback<00:01:09.060> mode

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
take out convert it into paperback mode

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.770 
take out convert it into paperback mode
and<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:12.000> clamps<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.600> used

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and go over the the clamps that I used

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230 
and go over the the clamps that I used
on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.460> we're<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.850> strong

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
on the other one we're not very strong

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.230 
on the other one we're not very strong
and<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:16.110> tended<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> pop<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:18.000> if

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and they tended to want to pop off if

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.490 
and they tended to want to pop off if
the<00:01:18.390> scanner<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.840> both<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.290> not

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the scanner got both and just not

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
the scanner got both and just not
satisfied<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> solution<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.299> anyway

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
satisfied with that solution so anyway

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940 
satisfied with that solution so anyway
in<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> version<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.439> thinking<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.799> should

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
in this version I'm thinking we should

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
in this version I'm thinking we should
just<00:01:23.130> screw<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.000> wood<00:01:24.180> screws<00:01:24.509> take

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just screw this in with wood screws take

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.539 
just screw this in with wood screws take
them<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> flip<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
them out when you need to flip it and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.300 
them out when you need to flip it and
then<00:01:26.729> flip<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.380> I'm<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.619> noticing<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
then flip it I'm also noticing on this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
then flip it I'm also noticing on this
particular<00:01:29.490> cut<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.390> kit<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> I'm

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
particular cut of this kit that I'm

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
particular cut of this kit that I'm
missing<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.590> screw<00:01:31.950> holes<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
missing the screw holes here and here so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.270 
missing the screw holes here and here so
I'll<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> manually<00:01:34.320> add<00:01:34.650> those<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I'll have to manually add those one of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'll have to manually add those one of
the<00:01:38.400> beauties<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.970> scanner<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the beauties of the scanner is that the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
the beauties of the scanner is that the
to<00:01:40.740> put<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> book<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.939> simply<00:01:42.240> take<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to put the book in you simply take the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.940 
to put the book in you simply take the
cradle<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> had<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.770> bungee

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
cradle out now if you had your bungee

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
cradle out now if you had your bungee
cords<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.460> you'd<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> disconnect<00:01:45.210> them

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
cords here you'd have to disconnect them

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.050 
cords here you'd have to disconnect them
so<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> wouldn't<00:01:45.899> fly<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so this wouldn't fly up but the the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
so this wouldn't fly up but the the
cradle<00:01:48.390> does<00:01:48.570> come<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.869> entirely<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.619> that's

cradle does come out entirely and that's
also<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.939> prime<00:01:51.740> enabling<00:01:52.740> technology<00:01:53.340> for

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
also the prime enabling technology for

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.690 
also the prime enabling technology for
paperback<00:01:53.939> mode<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> demonstrate<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
paperback mode so to demonstrate that I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
paperback mode so to demonstrate that I
want<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> install<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.560> top<00:01:58.890> plate<00:02:00.290> you'll

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
want to install this top plate you'll

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.660 
want to install this top plate you'll
see<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.770> actually<00:02:02.100> holes<00:02:02.310> pre-drilled

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
see there are actually holes pre-drilled

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.209 
see there are actually holes pre-drilled
for<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:04.020> future<00:02:04.290> versions<00:02:04.590> they<00:02:04.950> probably

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
for you in future versions they probably

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.260 
for you in future versions they probably
won't<00:02:05.670> be

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
won't be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
won't be
drill<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.289> this<00:02:07.409> version<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
drill but in this version they are and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:19.660 
drill but in this version they are and
it's<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.690> simple<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:12.560> drilling<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.800> there

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.140 

and<00:02:20.900> screwing<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.760> really

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and screwing it in now to do this really

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.670 
and screwing it in now to do this really
right<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:25.049> should<00:02:26.030> pre-drill<00:02:27.349> so<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
right you should pre-drill so that the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.539 
right you should pre-drill so that the
plywood<00:02:29.129> doesn't<00:02:29.430> split<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:32.069> i<00:02:32.190> think<00:02:32.400> i'm

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
plywood doesn't split and i think i'm

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.570 
plywood doesn't split and i think i'm
i'm<00:02:32.879> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> skip<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> moment<00:02:35.160> i

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
i'm going to skip that for the moment i

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.330 
i'm going to skip that for the moment i
might<00:02:35.910> head<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.599> there<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.930> it's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
might head in there like this but it's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.910 
might head in there like this but it's
going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> make<00:02:41.489> too<00:02:41.730> much<00:02:41.849> difference<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
going to make too much difference the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
going to make too much difference the
way<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:49.190> alright<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:51.480> our

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
way this is going alright so with our

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.559 
way this is going alright so with our
lighting<00:02:51.930> module<00:02:52.349> attached<00:02:53.269> maybe<00:02:54.269> i'll<00:02:54.420> put

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
lighting module attached maybe i'll put

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:09.160 
lighting module attached maybe i'll put
them<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:59.209> just<00:03:00.319> just<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.440> placeholder

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.420 

okay<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.560> essence<00:03:16.920> that's<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
okay yeah so in essence that's the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.160 
okay yeah so in essence that's the
that's<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.880> approach<00:03:18.239> screwed<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.930> two

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that's the approach screwed one two

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.759 
that's the approach screwed one two
three<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.459> four<00:03:21.389> lighting<00:03:22.139> module<00:03:22.500> screwed

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
three and four lighting module screwed

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.670 
three and four lighting module screwed
in<00:03:22.889> place<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> complete<00:03:24.680> imaging

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
in place and you have a complete imaging

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.700 
in place and you have a complete imaging
module<00:03:26.069> ready<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.579> go
