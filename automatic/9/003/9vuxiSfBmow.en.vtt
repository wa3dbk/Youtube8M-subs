is<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> skew<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> that's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
is at a bit of a skew and that's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
is at a bit of a skew and that's
probably<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> give<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.380> 2d

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
probably to give it more of that 2d

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
probably to give it more of that 2d

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the actual mission and here you can see

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
the actual mission and here you can see
I'm<00:01:38.939> walking<00:01:39.299> into<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> store<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.500> there's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I'm walking into a store but there's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
I'm walking into a store but there's
nothing<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.240> leads<00:01:42.450> me<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> behind

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
nothing here and it leads me to behind

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.480 
nothing here and it leads me to behind
the<00:01:43.290> map<00:01:44.210> sweet<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.770> few<00:01:46.770> pets<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.100> spawn<00:01:47.340> up

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the map sweet a few pets will spawn up

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
the map sweet a few pets will spawn up
here<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.299> here's<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> phone<00:01:48.990> booth<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
here too like here's a phone booth and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
here too like here's a phone booth and
it's<00:01:49.680> hidden<00:01:49.829> behind<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.220> wall<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.729> never

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it's hidden behind a wall so it's never

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
it's hidden behind a wall so it's never
actually<00:01:51.090> seen<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> game<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
actually seen in the game but a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually seen in the game but a
pedestrian<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.340> always<00:01:53.670> spawn<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
pedestrian will always spawn on it and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
pedestrian will always spawn on it and
you'll<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> few<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.380> pedestrians<00:01:55.950> spawn

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you'll see a few more pedestrians spawn

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.609 
you'll see a few more pedestrians spawn
on<00:01:56.369> stage<00:01:56.640> 3<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.090> well<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.540> all<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> means<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
on stage 3 as well and all that means is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.959 
on stage 3 as well and all that means is
that<00:01:58.649> they're<00:01:58.979> set<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.219> spawn<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> certain

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that they're set to spawn on certain

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
that they're set to spawn on certain
objects<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> phone<00:02:01.079> booth<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
objects like the phone booth the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.440 
objects like the phone booth the
sidewalk<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> whatever<00:02:02.460> you'll<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sidewalk and whatever you'll see the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
sidewalk and whatever you'll see the
same<00:02:03.630> thing<00:02:03.840> happened<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> Washington

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
same thing happened in the Washington

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
same thing happened in the Washington
stage<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.159> well

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
stage as well

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
right next to each other and you just

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
right next to each other and you just

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

obviously<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.430> more<00:02:20.580> straightforward<00:02:21.239> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
obviously a bit more straightforward and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.770 
obviously a bit more straightforward and
before<00:02:22.470> anyone<00:02:22.709> asked<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.480> honestly<00:02:24.480> don't

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
before anyone asked I honestly don't

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
before anyone asked I honestly don't
think<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:25.500> ever<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.670> be

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
think that it's ever going to be

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850 
think that it's ever going to be
possible<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.360> glitch<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:27.959> with<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.349> console

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
possible to glitch here with the console

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.949 
possible to glitch here with the console
I<00:02:29.069> know<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.360> would<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.750> definitely

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
I know that it would be definitely

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.680 
I know that it would be definitely
possible<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.739> get<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.519> an<00:02:32.670> RGH<00:02:33.239> or

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
possible to get here with like an RGH or

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.259 
possible to get here with like an RGH or
a<00:02:33.720> JTAG<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.880> want<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> talk

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
a JTAG but if you just want to talk

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.000 
a JTAG but if you just want to talk
about<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.660> plane<00:02:36.959> console<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.680> trying<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
about the plane console and trying to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.160 
about the plane console and trying to
glitch<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.989> ever

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
glitch here I don't think it's ever

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.640 
glitch here I don't think it's ever
going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.830> happen<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.230> should<00:02:43.230> save<00:02:43.470> me<00:02:43.620> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
going to happen so that should save me a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.740 
going to happen so that should save me a
few<00:02:43.709> thousand<00:02:44.250> comments<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:44.880> sorry<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
few thousand comments and I'm sorry it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.650 
few thousand comments and I'm sorry it
sucks<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.440> know<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:48.299> reason<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
sucks I know but all the more reason to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.199 
sucks I know but all the more reason to
get<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.810> PC<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:50.400> mods<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.940> so

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
get a PC because these mods are so

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
get a PC because these mods are so
fucking<00:02:51.630> good<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.019> want<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.380> say<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
fucking good I just want to say that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.180 
fucking good I just want to say that
right<00:02:52.830> now<00:02:52.860> ah<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:55.080> enough<00:02:55.350> enough<00:02:55.980> about

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
right now ah but enough enough about

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.750 
right now ah but enough enough about
that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.420 
that
here's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.209> 2-d<00:02:57.630> car<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:58.049> picking<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.739> it's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
here's a 2-d car I'm picking up and it's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.830 
here's a 2-d car I'm picking up and it's
the<00:02:59.549> only<00:02:59.730> vehicle<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.269> pick<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.600> here

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the only vehicle you can pick up here

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120 
the only vehicle you can pick up here
and<00:03:01.019> I'm<00:03:01.110> assuming<00:03:01.350> that's<00:03:01.560> because<00:03:01.950> they

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and I'm assuming that's because they

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.039 
and I'm assuming that's because they
actually<00:03:02.580> gave<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:02.880> some<00:03:03.150> sort<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.420> action<00:03:03.780> but

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
actually gave it some sort of action but
