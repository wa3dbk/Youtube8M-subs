00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
wait for it to dry and also doesn't take

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
wait for it to dry and also doesn't take
too<00:02:20.549> long<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> dry<00:02:21.209> usually<00:02:21.630> five

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
too long for it to dry usually five

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.449 
too long for it to dry usually five
minutes<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> most<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:23.040> obviously<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
smaller your horn is the less time it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.250

you that the best way to avoid that is

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.690 
you that the best way to avoid that is
by<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.560> letting<00:02:55.859> it<00:02:55.980> touch<00:02:56.130> your<00:02:56.280> skin<00:02:56.519> so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
by not letting it touch your skin so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.920 
by not letting it touch your skin so
much<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.180> when<00:02:57.329> you're<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.450> standby<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
stuff but you know it just happens

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.220 
stuff but you know it just happens
regardless<00:02:59.760> sometimes<00:03:00.450> I've<00:03:00.870> heard<00:03:01.079> there

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
regardless sometimes I've heard there

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.360 
regardless sometimes I've heard there
are<00:03:01.290> some<00:03:01.410> products<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.890> take<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.220> off

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
are some products that take it off

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.099 
are some products that take it off
almost<00:03:02.640> immediately<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.660> when<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.870> happens

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
almost immediately but when it happens

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
grease and a lot of time but it works

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.930
