00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.400
 heart of feelings 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.700
 where is the moon 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.190
 the line of the mind everything related 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 with the way of thinking 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.399
 a little bit clearer with the part 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.399
 emotional but especially 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.270
 let's say that a woman the good the 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.270
 most 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.260
 are couple relationships

 the nice ones we're going 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.469
 in a certain way that is the finger of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.469
 mercury for 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.150
 my life 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 of here 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.790
 the children 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.630
 there is the mount of venus this is the mount 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.630
 of the moon 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 when this mountain is the mountain of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.159
 Venus 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.159
 raised is the plane 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.659
 the normal and it is lifted we could 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.679
 say he's a little bit up 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.420
 although it is a little bit that makes the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.650
 person 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.460
 a little bit passionate energetic 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.080
 Energy 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.290
 with good energy 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.300
 this line quote got off the heart 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.950
 when the lines come down as 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.900
 that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.260
 it means disappointments relationships 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.500
 loving ones already finished with all my heart 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.490
 when the lines stack up from to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.010
 the color is from the line 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.640
 it means a success in a relationship 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.640
 amorous 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.140
 you will be left alone 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.390
 the idea of ​​reading the line of the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.920
 hand the idea of ​​astrology is that of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.380
 some way can not help the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.180
 person because that is the karma that goes to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.400
 have to go but that can not help 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.300
 person 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.650
 what are important 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.459
 for example let's say on the line in the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.459
 health line 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.200
 and one is the fact that this means 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.920
 that you have to take care of yourself because 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.330
 some things we do not go 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.110
 then we had to have to study 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.110
 art with debris 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.280
 sweet 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.410
 for example in the heart line 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.410
 we can and we go here 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.370
 if you have 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.250
 there is one there is a line 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:10.120
 lines of fortune and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.120
 you need a little curved writes 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.980
 will somehow enter you 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.600
 a part 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.580
 the human being has free 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.460
 this is to put grace 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.460
 and we fall short
