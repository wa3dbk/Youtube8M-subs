with Mayweather if it ever happens you
know<00:03:21.260> what<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.290> think<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.980> Pacquiao<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:24.709> not

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
know what I think that Pacquiao is not

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.770 
know what I think that Pacquiao is not
doing<00:03:26.070> well<00:03:26.130> fighting<00:03:26.970> Bradley<00:03:27.330> because<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
doing well fighting Bradley because that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.280 
doing well fighting Bradley because that
in<00:03:27.930> Bradley's<00:03:28.320> hungry<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.610> he's<00:03:29.970> coming<00:03:30.480> he's

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
in Bradley's hungry and he's coming he's

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.050 
in Bradley's hungry and he's coming he's
coming<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.769> everything<00:03:32.250> he's<00:03:32.700> gone<00:03:32.910> he's

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
coming for everything he's gone he's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.850 
coming for everything he's gone he's
gonna<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.600> he<00:03:34.290> wants<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.560> get<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.769> all
