real place and it sort of breaks the

wanted<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> know<00:03:21.150> where<00:03:21.300> they<00:03:21.450> were<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.900> it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
wanted to know where they were and it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.070 
wanted to know where they were and it
wasn't<00:03:22.470> until<00:03:22.739> uh<00:03:23.180> pretty<00:03:24.180> early<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.600> and

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
wasn't until uh pretty early on and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.750 
wasn't until uh pretty early on and
Epcot's<00:03:25.950> life<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.550> eventually

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
Epcot's life that they eventually

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.340 
Epcot's life that they eventually
started<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.420> put<00:03:27.630> them<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.140> there<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
started to put them back in there and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.870 
started to put them back in there and
you<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.680> futuristic<00:03:29.250> Mickey<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.700> things

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
you got the futuristic Mickey and things

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.780 
you got the futuristic Mickey and things
like<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.340> see<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.520> little

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
like that and I think you see a little

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.150 
like that and I think you see a little
bit<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.330> Three<00:03:33.569> Caballeros<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
bit you see the Three Caballeros in the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.340 
bit you see the Three Caballeros in the
Mexican<00:03:35.610> pavilions<00:03:36.090> ride<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.959> think<00:03:37.200> that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
Mexican pavilions ride and I think that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.870 
Mexican pavilions ride and I think that
serves<00:03:37.709> as<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> good<00:03:38.070> example<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> can

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
serves as a good example that you can

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.810 
serves as a good example that you can
have<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> ride<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.739> celebrates<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.950> culture

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
have a ride that celebrates the culture

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.910 
have a ride that celebrates the culture
of<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.150> country<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.810> still<00:03:43.019> incorporate

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
of a country but still incorporate

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.670 
of a country but still incorporate
Disney<00:03:44.430> property<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.530> would<00:03:46.650> be

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
Disney property so I think this would be

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.740 
Disney property so I think this would be
really<00:03:46.980> cool<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.400> that's<00:03:48.090> where<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.360> sort<00:03:48.660> of

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
really cool and that's where I sort of

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.120 
really cool and that's where I sort of
started<00:03:49.080> with<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.769> had<00:03:50.010> this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
started with it but then I had this

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.680 
started with it but then I had this
other<00:03:50.400> idea<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.970> want<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.269> throw<00:03:51.450> into<00:03:51.600> it

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
other idea that I want to throw into it

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.410 
other idea that I want to throw into it
so<00:03:51.989> yeah<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.260> have<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.680> Muppet<00:03:53.100> uh

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so yeah you have the Muppet uh

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.670 
so yeah you have the Muppet uh
animatronics<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:54.930> these<00:03:55.080> funny<00:03:55.319> scenes

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
animatronics you have these funny scenes

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.800 
animatronics you have these funny scenes
just<00:03:55.950> showing<00:03:56.160> off<00:03:56.280> Norway<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:57.150> alone<00:03:57.600> I

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
just showing off Norway that alone I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.990 
just showing off Norway that alone I
think<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.110> enough<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.709> sort<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.220> refurb<00:03:59.790> and

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
think is enough to sort of refurb and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.900 
think is enough to sort of refurb and
and<00:04:00.150> bring<00:04:00.660> new<00:04:00.810> life<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.319> attraction

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
and bring new life to this attraction

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.670 
and bring new life to this attraction
but<00:04:02.989> what<00:04:03.989> if<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.560> made<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.610> attraction<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
but what if you made the attraction a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.949 
but what if you made the attraction a
series<00:04:07.680> now<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.730> see<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.180> with<00:04:09.390> film<00:04:09.720> right

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
series now you see this with film right

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.780 
series now you see this with film right
you<00:04:10.110> have<00:04:10.260> movies<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.709> are<00:04:10.980> standalone<00:04:11.430> and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
you have movies that are standalone and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.100 
you have movies that are standalone and
then<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.239> trilogies<00:04:12.810> where<00:04:12.989> they

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
then you have like trilogies where they

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.080 
then you have like trilogies where they
sort<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.470> tie<00:04:13.709> together<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.910> don't

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
sort of tie together but you don't

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.490 
sort of tie together but you don't
really<00:04:15.209> see<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.780> attractions<00:04:16.350> in

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500

of like inherently connected but what if

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.140 
of like inherently connected but what if
you<00:04:33.270> made<00:04:33.720> sort<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.680> series<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.190> attractions

certain jokes that make sense if you go
from<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.440> Canada<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.190> Mexico<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.910> then

from you know Canada to Mexico and then

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.820 
from you know Canada to Mexico and then
other<00:05:09.510> jokes<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.020> will<00:05:10.140> make<00:05:10.260> more<00:05:10.410> sense<00:05:10.470> if

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
other jokes that will make more sense if

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.529

you go from Mexico to Canada and things

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.240 
you go from Mexico to Canada and things
like<00:05:12.659> that<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.080> think<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.620> would<00:05:13.770> be<00:05:13.919> really

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
like that I think that would be really

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.250 
like that I think that would be really
an<00:05:14.370> interesting<00:05:14.729> in<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.330> themes<00:05:15.570> park<00:05:15.900> park

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
an interesting in the themes park park

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.350 
an interesting in the themes park park
space<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.650> think<00:05:16.710> that'd<00:05:16.919> be<00:05:16.950> towed

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
space I think that'd be towed

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.480 
space I think that'd be towed
innovative<00:05:17.840> we've<00:05:17.990> never<00:05:18.199> seen<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:18.979> theme-park

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
innovative we've never seen a theme-park

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.279 
innovative we've never seen a theme-park
really<00:05:20.030> try<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.240> do<00:05:20.479> that<00:05:20.629> create<00:05:20.960> this<00:05:21.110> sort

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
really try to do that create this sort

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.439 
really try to do that create this sort
of<00:05:21.409> series<00:05:21.889> of<00:05:21.919> attractions<00:05:22.580> that<00:05:22.789> are<00:05:23.000> meant

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
of series of attractions that are meant

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.270 
of series of attractions that are meant
to<00:05:23.509> be<00:05:23.659> experienced<00:05:24.259> in<00:05:24.319> a<00:05:24.409> certain<00:05:24.770> order<00:05:24.889> and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
to be experienced in a certain order and

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.029 
to be experienced in a certain order and
tie<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.210> together<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.719> think<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.229> would<00:05:27.349> include

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
tie in together I think it would include

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.980 
tie in together I think it would include
Disney<00:05:28.460> property<00:05:28.939> that<00:05:29.060> would<00:05:29.210> be<00:05:29.300> super

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
Disney property that would be super

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.540 
Disney property that would be super
beneficial<00:05:30.169> for<00:05:30.650> Disney<00:05:30.979> because<00:05:31.250> they<00:05:31.370> have

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
beneficial for Disney because they have

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.830 
beneficial for Disney because they have
the<00:05:31.699> Muppets<00:05:32.060> that's<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.300> property<00:05:32.629> that

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
the Muppets that's a property that

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.990 
the Muppets that's a property that
they'd<00:05:32.990> want<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.289> showcase<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:34.580> would<00:05:34.729> allow

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
they'd want to showcase it would allow

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.700 
they'd want to showcase it would allow
these<00:05:35.210> attractions<00:05:35.599> to<00:05:35.900> still<00:05:36.199> be<00:05:36.349> relevant

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
these attractions to still be relevant

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.429 
these attractions to still be relevant
to<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.129> countries<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:37.610> they're<00:05:37.969> in<00:05:38.629> and<00:05:39.050> it

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
to the countries that they're in and it

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.290 
to the countries that they're in and it
would<00:05:39.500> allow<00:05:39.710> them<00:05:39.889> to<00:05:39.919> focus<00:05:40.460> on<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.939> culture

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
would allow them to focus on the culture

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.999 
would allow them to focus on the culture
of<00:05:41.360> those<00:05:41.569> countries<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:42.289> I<00:05:42.650> think<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:42.949> would

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
of those countries and I think it would

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.080 
of those countries and I think it would
be<00:05:43.099> something<00:05:43.280> that<00:05:43.490> would<00:05:43.580> be<00:05:43.639> fun<00:05:43.819> for<00:05:44.060> all

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
be something that would be fun for all

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.459 
be something that would be fun for all
ages<00:05:44.509> so<00:05:44.629> that's<00:05:44.810> what<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> would<00:05:45.199> do<00:05:45.289> with<00:05:45.379> the

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
ages so that's what I would do with the

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.200 
ages so that's what I would do with the
Maelstrom<00:05:46.009> if<00:05:46.129> you<00:05:46.430> gave<00:05:46.580> me<00:05:46.610> an<00:05:46.759> unlimited
