00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.080 
nothing to do with the the jumper guys
doing<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.160> just<00:02:00.250> happened<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.910> be<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
doing it and it just happened to be the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.240 
doing it and it just happened to be the
same<00:02:01.270> timing<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.319> mean<00:02:02.920> it's<00:02:03.069> very

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250
