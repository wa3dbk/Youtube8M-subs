all that kind of thing he's only 21
years<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.440> age<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.780> mean<00:03:13.019> they've<00:03:13.139> got

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
years of age and I mean they've got

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.900 
years of age and I mean they've got
Ericsson<00:03:13.709> who's<00:03:13.859> also<00:03:14.100> gonna<00:03:14.190> perform<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.819> very

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
specific role there but I think in terms

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.150 
specific role there but I think in terms
of<00:03:17.600> getting<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.810> behind<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.470> back<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.950> all

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
of getting in behind the back for all

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that kind of thing I think the Mellon's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.840 
that kind of thing I think the Mellon's
gonna<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.600> great
