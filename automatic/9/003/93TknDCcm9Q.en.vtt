that's a different story you will have
to<00:04:03.550> test<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.970> secure<00:04:04.360> desktop<00:04:04.600> on<00:04:05.080> your

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
to test the secure desktop on your

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.070 
to test the secure desktop on your
applications<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.460> course<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.480> very<00:04:07.810> very

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
applications of course so very very

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.080 
applications of course so very very
simple<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.650> do<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.220> go<00:04:09.400> ahead<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:09.640> fire<00:04:10.060> up

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
simple to do just go ahead and fire up

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.760 
simple to do just go ahead and fire up
the<00:04:10.390> application<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.850> fire<00:04:12.850> up<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.420> UAC<00:04:14.200> prompt

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
the application and fire up a UAC prompt

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.789 
the application and fire up a UAC prompt
that<00:04:15.010> requires<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:16.030> secure<00:04:16.540> desktop<00:04:16.750> if<00:04:17.230> your

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
that requires the secure desktop if your

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.130 
that requires the secure desktop if your
application<00:04:18.010> locks<00:04:18.880> up<00:04:19.209> then<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.660> course<00:04:19.930> you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
application locks up then of course you
