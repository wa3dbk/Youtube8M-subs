00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
updated the models and so far we've seen

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.150 
updated the models and so far we've seen
five<00:00:09.929> races<00:00:10.410> these<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.259> orcs<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
five races these are the the orcs the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
five races these are the the orcs the
dwarves<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.059> gnomes<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.839> tauren<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.260 
dwarves the gnomes the tauren and the
undead<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.640> sure<00:00:17.789> we're<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> see

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
undead but I'm sure we're going to see

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
undead but I'm sure we're going to see
way<00:00:18.510> more<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.900> come<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> background

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
way more to come in the background

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.050 
way more to come in the background
you'll<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.460> screenshots<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you'll just see some screenshots and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
you'll just see some screenshots and
that<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.260> overall<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:22.949> they

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
that kind of thing so overall what they

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.439 
that kind of thing so overall what they
said<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.550> want<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> keep<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> original

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
said is they want to keep the original

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
said is they want to keep the original
soul<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> characters<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:25.949> feel

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
soul of the characters on how they feel

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.580 
soul of the characters on how they feel
but<00:00:26.939> 10<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.420> need<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.869> while<00:00:28.109> only

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
but 10 they need to do this while only

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.370 
but 10 they need to do this while only
increasing<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> visual<00:00:29.670> fidelity<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.510> so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
increasing the visual fidelity and so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.510 
increasing the visual fidelity and so
basically<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.070> essence<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> character

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
basically the essence of the character

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.240 
basically the essence of the character
is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> same<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> looks<00:00:34.110> better<00:00:34.440> facial

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is the same but it looks better facial

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
is the same but it looks better facial
detail<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:35.969> an<00:00:36.090> emphasis<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> they

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
detail was also an emphasis and they

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
detail was also an emphasis and they
have<00:00:37.290> fully<00:00:37.469> read<00:00:37.680> faces<00:00:37.950> four<00:00:38.250> remotes<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
have fully read faces four remotes and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
have fully read faces four remotes and
that<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> thing<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.690> they've<00:00:39.899> also

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that kind of thing and they've also

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
that kind of thing and they've also
updated<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.649> animations<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.399> every<00:00:41.760> single

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
updated the animations for every single

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
updated the animations for every single
race<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:43.379> also<00:00:43.530> did<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.100> animations

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
race and they also did some animations

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
race and they also did some animations
on<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> video<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> stream<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.379> don't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
on a video on the stream which I don't

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
on a video on the stream which I don't
have<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.920> me<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> minute<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have with me at the minute but as you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
have with me at the minute but as you
can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> definitely<00:00:48.660> looks<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.050> good

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
can see it definitely looks very good

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
can see it definitely looks very good
now<00:00:49.860> let's<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> chat<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.640> some<00:00:50.910> these

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
now let's have a chat about some these

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.639 
now let's have a chat about some these
screenshots<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.809> flying<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.289> screen

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
screenshots that are flying by in screen

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
screenshots that are flying by in screen
right<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> gnomes<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> if

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
right now you can see the gnomes and if

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
right now you can see the gnomes and if
you<00:00:54.390> compare<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.050> top<00:00:55.379> sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> layer<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you compare the top sort of layer to the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
you compare the top sort of layer to the
bottom<00:00:57.180> M<00:00:58.170> turns<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> ones<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.920> showing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
bottom M turns the ones that's showing

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.500 
bottom M turns the ones that's showing
the<00:00:59.129> polygons<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.359> much

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the polygons you can just see how much

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
the polygons you can just see how much
higher<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> polygon<00:01:01.230> count<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> new<00:01:01.739> one

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
higher the polygon count for the new one

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
higher the polygon count for the new one
is<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.670> emotes<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.270> sort<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> thing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is also emotes and that sort of thing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170 
is also emotes and that sort of thing
are<00:01:03.870> far<00:01:04.260> far<00:01:04.710> higher<00:01:04.979> quality<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.000> one

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
are far far higher quality and this one

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
are far far higher quality and this one
of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> dwarf<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.680> how<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> M

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of the dwarf you can just see how the M

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
of the dwarf you can just see how the M
the<00:01:08.790> texture<00:01:09.119> resolution<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.720> much<00:01:09.990> higher

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the texture resolution is much higher

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
the texture resolution is much higher
we'll<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.010> leads<00:01:11.220> well<00:01:11.520> sorry<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
we'll just leads well sorry this is the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
we'll just leads well sorry this is the
old<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> crappy<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
old one so it's kind of crappy right and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
old one so it's kind of crappy right and
this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.670> new<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.259> how

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this is new one and you can see just how

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
this is new one and you can see just how
much<00:01:16.590> higher<00:01:17.310> quality<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.150> M<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> different

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
much higher quality the M the different

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
much higher quality the M the different
masses<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.159> compare

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
masses are and if you actually compare

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.070 
masses are and if you actually compare
the<00:01:20.729> polygons<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.840> about

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the polygons this one is I think about

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.109 
the polygons this one is I think about
seven<00:01:22.500> times<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> polygons<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> previous

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
seven times the polygons of the previous

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
seven times the polygons of the previous
one<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.750> damn<00:01:24.960> impressive<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> if

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
one which is very damn impressive and if

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.499 
one which is very damn impressive and if
you<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.130> look<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.520> overall<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.240> dwarf

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you just look at this overall the dwarf

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
you just look at this overall the dwarf
model<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.439> looks<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> dwarf<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
model just it looks like a dwarf it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
model just it looks like a dwarf it
looks<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.060> an<00:01:30.180> iconic<00:01:30.600> warcraft<00:01:31.020> dwarf<00:01:31.350> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
looks like an iconic warcraft dwarf but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
looks like an iconic warcraft dwarf but
better<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> females<00:01:34.140> can't

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
better and as for the females can't

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.490 
better and as for the females can't
leave<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.630> well<00:01:36.630> surprisingly

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
leave them out and well surprisingly

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
leave them out and well surprisingly
another<00:01:37.770> day<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.310> look<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> less

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
another day I think they look and less

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
another day I think they look and less
potato<00:01:39.600> face<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.229> their<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.829> did<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
potato face than their they did in

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
potato face than their they did in
actual<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.380> female<00:01:43.770> dwarf

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
actual well I think the female dwarf

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
actual well I think the female dwarf
models<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.820> did<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> bad<00:01:45.119> job<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.420> them

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
models they really did a bad job at them

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
models they really did a bad job at them
so<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.530> nice<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.189> actually<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
so it's nice to see them actually make a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
so it's nice to see them actually make a
really<00:01:48.270> cool<00:01:48.479> looking<00:01:48.720> female<00:01:49.020> dwarf<00:01:49.200> there's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
really cool looking female dwarf there's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.039 
really cool looking female dwarf there's
the<00:01:50.040> orc<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.759> went<00:01:50.939> by<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> gnome

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the orc just went by and on this gnome

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.859 
the orc just went by and on this gnome
you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.820> M<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you can see just how much the M the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.060 
you can see just how much the M the
facial<00:01:55.200> animations<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.890> working

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
facial animations are really working

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
facial animations are really working
there<00:01:56.369> rather<00:01:57.119> subtle<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.140> still

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
there rather subtle but you can still

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
there rather subtle but you can still
see<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> facial<00:01:59.250> expression<00:01:59.759> which<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> quite

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
see a facial expression which is quite

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.209 
see a facial expression which is quite
nice<00:02:00.479> considering<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> age<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> engine

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
nice considering the age of the engine

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280 
nice considering the age of the engine
once<00:02:02.700> again<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.270> different<00:02:03.840> things

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
once again you can see different things

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
once again you can see different things
in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> female<00:02:04.950> gnome<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.479> don't

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in the female gnome it's I think I don't

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.150 
in the female gnome it's I think I don't
know<00:02:06.689> no<00:02:07.020> I'm<00:02:07.079> still<00:02:07.320> kinda<00:02:07.590> look<00:02:07.680> weird<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> me

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
know no I'm still kinda look weird to me

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
know no I'm still kinda look weird to me
but<00:02:08.429> whatever<00:02:08.670> hey<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> think<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.660> works

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
but whatever hey I think it works

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.000 
but whatever hey I think it works
actually<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.849> tauren<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
actually and there is the tauren the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.369 
actually and there is the tauren the
all<00:02:13.099> de<00:02:13.280> Toron<00:02:13.489> who<00:02:13.909> looks<00:02:14.870> very<00:02:14.959> weird

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
all de Toron who looks very weird

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.259 
all de Toron who looks very weird
doesn't<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.459> many<00:02:16.580> polygons<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
doesn't it not that many polygons and

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.449 
doesn't it not that many polygons and
extremely<00:02:18.170> low<00:02:18.470> resolution<00:02:19.069> textures

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
extremely low resolution textures

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.949 
extremely low resolution textures
they're<00:02:19.640> rather<00:02:19.790> painful<00:02:20.239> looking<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
they're rather painful looking and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.839 
they're rather painful looking and
here's<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.439> new<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.640> I

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
here's the new one as you can see I

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.750 
here's the new one as you can see I
think<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.329> guy<00:02:23.420> looks<00:02:23.720> absolutely<00:02:24.079> great

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
think this guy looks absolutely great

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.160 
think this guy looks absolutely great
overall<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.510> definitely<00:02:26.750> feels<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.140> a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
overall it definitely feels like a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.289 
overall it definitely feels like a
torrent<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.560> looks<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> tauren<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.459> irie

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
torrent it looks like a tauren and irie

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.119 
torrent it looks like a tauren and irie
like<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.569> detail<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.170> stuff<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.829> horns

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
like the detail on stuff like the horns

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.280 
like the detail on stuff like the horns
and<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> braids<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.879> sort<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.299> thing<00:02:32.390> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
and the braids and that sort of thing so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.220 
and the braids and that sort of thing so
overall<00:02:33.709> there<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.190> go<00:02:34.430> now<00:02:34.849> in<00:02:35.239> terms<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.989> some

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
overall there we go now in terms of some

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.410 
overall there we go now in terms of some
more<00:02:36.409> details<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.040> things<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.209> that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
more details and things we know that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.759 
more details and things we know that
least<00:02:38.629> these<00:02:38.750> five<00:02:38.989> will<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.230> at<00:02:39.319> launch<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
least these five will be at launch and

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.990 
least these five will be at launch and
previously<00:02:40.159> a<00:02:40.250> lot<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.519> people<00:02:40.760> thought<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
previously a lot of people thought that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.330 
previously a lot of people thought that
the<00:02:41.239> new<00:02:41.420> models<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.870> coming<00:02:42.109> after<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the new models will be coming after the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.789 
the new models will be coming after the
expansion<00:02:43.819> launches<00:02:43.970> via<00:02:44.540> patches<00:02:45.230> well<00:02:45.709> it

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
expansion launches via patches well it

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.229 
expansion launches via patches well it
seems<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.040> they<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.340> five<00:02:46.579> races<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.090> to

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
seems like they have five races down to

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.910 
seems like they have five races down to
the<00:02:47.299> minute<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:47.810> well<00:02:48.409> they<00:02:48.560> may<00:02:48.680> as<00:02:48.739> well

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the minute so well they may as well

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.430 
the minute so well they may as well
continue<00:02:49.159> right<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:49.819> get<00:02:50.450> all<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.109> them<00:02:51.230> done

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
continue right and get all of them done

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.199 
continue right and get all of them done
I'd<00:02:51.739> imagine<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.400> unless<00:02:52.579> this<00:02:52.790> expansion

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
I'd imagine that unless this expansion

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.839 
I'd imagine that unless this expansion
is<00:02:53.480> releasing<00:02:54.079> them<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.379> I<00:02:54.680> know<00:02:55.129> December

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
is releasing them like I know December

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.520 
is releasing them like I know December
or<00:02:55.879> something<00:02:56.209> ridiculous<00:02:56.329> then<00:02:56.900> they<00:02:57.379> will

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
or something ridiculous then they will

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.780 
or something ridiculous then they will
be<00:02:57.650> able<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.889> get<00:02:58.010> all<00:02:58.159> of<00:02:58.190> these<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.549> for

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
be able to get all of these in for

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.160 
be able to get all of these in for
launch<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.299> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.599> that's<00:02:59.780> really

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
models personally I'm enamored I think

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.539 
models personally I'm enamored I think
they're<00:03:05.450> fantastic<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.409> really<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.340> great

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
they're fantastic and really a great

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.099 
they're fantastic and really a great
visual<00:03:07.849> sort<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.420> update<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.930> game

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
visual sort of update to the game

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.599 
visual sort of update to the game
sometimes<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:09.829> annoying<00:03:09.920> having<00:03:10.190> all<00:03:10.489> this

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
sometimes it's annoying having all this

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.860 
sometimes it's annoying having all this
cool<00:03:10.819> armor<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.269> then<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.480> actually<00:03:11.750> see

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
cool armor and then you actually see

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.210 
cool armor and then you actually see
your<00:03:11.989> character<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.620> looks<00:03:12.799> like<00:03:12.889> crap

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
your character and it looks like crap

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.710 
your character and it looks like crap
that's<00:03:13.519> why<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> play<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:13.909> draenei<00:03:14.329> mostly

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's why I play a draenei mostly

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.319 
that's why I play a draenei mostly
because<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.079> model<00:03:15.379> itself<00:03:15.670> doesn't<00:03:16.670> look<00:03:17.060> as

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
because the model itself doesn't look as

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.569 
because the model itself doesn't look as
ridiculously<00:03:18.079> sort<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.799> full<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.129> polygons

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
ridiculously sort of full of polygons

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.849 
ridiculously sort of full of polygons

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859
