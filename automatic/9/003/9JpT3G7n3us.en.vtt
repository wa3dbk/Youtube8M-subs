00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 U 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:19.090
 Oh, you are interested in health. 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 4 To be healthy, especially if you want to prevent cancer 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.570
 Ah 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.570
 What can I do to get rid of the toxins? I can prevent cancer or diabetes. 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.739
 Whether ahh how you can remove neundeyo will do today to let you know 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:41.629
 So we can split the food and absorb it into our bodies. 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:45.949
 If we make it small in Korea , it will be absorbed by our body. 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 It's too big and it turns into a toxic substance. 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:57.710
 So it is important that we eat good food, 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:03.559
 To create a food Yes Without this ability in our body toxins toxins 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.750
 I know it's going to be a substance so I can not be a carcinogen. 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:14.450
 I 'm going to let you know how to give it today, which is the detox juice. 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.970
 Yes 4. Detoxifying juice means that we usually have 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.030
 Fruits and vegetables a day 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 I say to eat six to nine times. 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.049
 But say that you'll never see the same people probably 9 times 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.659
 There are nine people who eat ID 9 here. 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:37.700
 So even if you eat once, it will be important to have a higher absorption rate. 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:43.009
 When we ate , 5 to 10% 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.280
 Have a 60% absorption by eating boiled and it is another that 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.560
 90% will be absorbed 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.359
 Therefore , even if you ate one time, boil, grind, eat , 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.159
 Points 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:03.049
 I do not understand. 4 But what you were most afraid of 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:07.399
 When you heat it, you hear that vitamin c is destroyed and the enzyme is destroyed. 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:12.980
 Of course it does, but it does not destroy the whole thing. 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.800
 Vitamin C is more important than this, and antioxidants, which are more important than this, 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.170
 It's better absorbed in our body when it's applied. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.810
 Therefore, the body is going through the debris to enter than any cell in the meantime, of Shem 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.580
 Since emerging as a mutation, eliminating 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:34.130
 The 10th floor or the constipated people eat this detox juice and the actual obesity 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 Now a lot of people, but I really liked accentuated platter debris that turned waste 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:43.010
 That's the advantage of being able to get out. 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:48.170
 I need six vegetable juices for this detox. 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:53.180
 Actually, four broccoli cabbages are very similar. 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.750
 It is a substance containing a lot of sulfur component, but broccoli cabbage has good sulfur 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.120
 It contains ingredients and antioxidants, 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:06.650
 Helicobacter pylori, especially Helicobacter pylori, 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.330
 May be of the red pigment lycopene prostate you know you are good breasts also 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.740
 Good antioxidants and beta-carotene in carrots of energy in our body 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.890
 Great to make 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:20.270
 This will be helpful and also important for toxin removal. 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.600
 And apples and bananas are especially potassium banana rolled recent study 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:28.100
 Results also reduce stroke 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.510
 Do 22% Yes Hunger is good for potassium 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.130
 Bananas have a lot of starch, so all of them are actually very influential. 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.590
 So it's enough to be a meal, 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.210
 The part on the skin makes a lot of brown fat in our body, 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.290
 Going to be harmful to our bodies calm 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:53.600
 Brown fat is making energy in our body so we turn brown fat 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:57.200
 It is especially helpful to have a gallbladder or a 30-part rabbit. 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.210
 People are working on the apple that is in the apple. 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:07.160
 There 's enough that malic acid for cancer in our body that malic 2 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:10.210
 Because it works well with the emulsifying of the good button, the prevention of cardiovascular disease 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.210
 It can be very good
