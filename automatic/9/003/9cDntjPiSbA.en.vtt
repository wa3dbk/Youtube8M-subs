00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
start off with race number one here on

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.539 
start off with race number one here on
the<00:01:56.579> Rome<00:01:57.210> circuit<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.020> reverse

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
the Rome circuit it's actually reverse

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.340 
the Rome circuit it's actually reverse
now<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.759> first<00:01:59.969> track<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.110> about

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
now this first track is all about

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.570 
now this first track is all about
acceleration<00:02:01.950> accelerator<00:02:02.909> control

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
acceleration accelerator control

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.000 
acceleration accelerator control
just<00:02:05.300> get<00:02:05.450> in<00:02:05.540> your<00:02:05.570> lines<00:02:05.960> real<00:02:06.350> nice<00:02:06.650> and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
just get in your lines real nice and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710 
just get in your lines real nice and
smooth<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.550> basically<00:02:08.000> trying<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.360> keep<00:02:08.570> your

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
smooth and basically trying to keep your

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540 
smooth and basically trying to keep your
speed<00:02:09.080> high<00:02:09.350> throughout<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.070> whole<00:02:10.250> course

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
speed high throughout the whole course

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.400 
speed high throughout the whole course
not<00:02:10.880> having<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.210> slow<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:11.540> too<00:02:11.750> much<00:02:11.930> I'm

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
not having to slow down too much I'm

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.560 
not having to slow down too much I'm
really<00:02:12.740> powering<00:02:13.100> through<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.180> corners

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
really powering through the the corners

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.670 
really powering through the the corners
that's<00:02:14.750> where<00:02:14.900> you're<00:02:14.990> gonna<00:02:15.080> keep<00:02:15.290> all<00:02:15.470> your

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that's where you're gonna keep all your

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.050 
that's where you're gonna keep all your
speed<00:02:16.090> most<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.570> day<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.820> generally<00:02:19.820> tend

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
speed most of the day I generally tend

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.660 
speed most of the day I generally tend
to<00:02:20.240> be<00:02:20.360> slower<00:02:20.660> around<00:02:20.840> corners<00:02:21.470> than<00:02:21.770> let's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
to be slower around corners than let's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.860 
to be slower around corners than let's
say<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:22.970> Australia<00:02:23.300> it's<00:02:23.570> fairly<00:02:23.780> obvious

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
say on the Australia it's fairly obvious

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.990 
say on the Australia it's fairly obvious
but<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.380> mean<00:02:24.620> they're<00:02:24.770> not<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.010> great<00:02:25.550> going

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
but I mean they're not that great going

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.520 
but I mean they're not that great going
around<00:02:26.270> corners<00:02:26.780> even<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> hardest

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
around corners even on the hardest

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530 
around corners even on the hardest
difficulty<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.850> generally<00:02:29.120> where

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
difficulty and that is generally where

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.630 
difficulty and that is generally where
you<00:02:29.660> find<00:02:29.960> most<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.620> speed<00:02:30.920> against<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
you find most of your speed against the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
you find most of your speed against the
the<00:02:31.970> AI<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.900> smooth<00:02:33.140> up<00:02:33.320> those

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the AI so if you can smooth up those

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.100 
the AI so if you can smooth up those
areas<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:34.670> that's<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.480> know<00:02:35.630> where<00:02:36.020> you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
areas then that's you know where you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.870 
areas then that's you know where you
make<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.320> killing<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.890> particular<00:02:37.490> corner

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
make a killing that particular corner

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.310 
make a killing that particular corner
there<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.600> seem<00:02:38.810> coming<00:02:39.230> in

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
there that you just seem coming in

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.010 
there that you just seem coming in
through<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.530> little<00:02:39.800> chicane<00:02:40.250> sort<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.670> area

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
through that little chicane sort of area

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.180 
through that little chicane sort of area
it's<00:02:42.020> actually<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> really<00:02:42.470> nice<00:02:42.680> place<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.100> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
it's actually a really nice place if you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.660 
it's actually a really nice place if you
can<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.580> slide<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.150> club<00:02:44.330> very<00:02:44.720> slightly<00:02:45.670> so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
can just slide the club very slightly so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.210 
can just slide the club very slightly so
that<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.970> get<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:48.140> kind<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.470> face<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.950> right

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that you get you kind of face it right

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190 
that you get you kind of face it right
between<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.820> two<00:02:49.850> barriers<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.900> sort

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
between the two barriers and just sort

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.080 
between the two barriers and just sort
of<00:02:51.340> accelerate<00:02:52.340> straight<00:02:52.760> down<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.060> middle

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
of accelerate straight down the middle

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.940 
of accelerate straight down the middle
as<00:02:53.330> opposed<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> actually<00:02:54.080> turning<00:02:54.530> left<00:02:54.740> and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
as opposed to actually turning left and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.530 
as opposed to actually turning left and
right<00:02:55.130> you'll<00:02:55.400> get<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.880> lot<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.120> speed<00:02:56.300> through

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
right you'll get a lot of speed through

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.340 
right you'll get a lot of speed through
that<00:02:56.750> area<00:02:56.930> oh<00:02:59.290> sorry<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.709> really<00:03:00.860> bad<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
that area oh sorry it's really bad and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.110 
that area oh sorry it's really bad and
yeah<00:03:03.350> like<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.560> said<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.490> generally

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
yeah like I said this is generally

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.330 
yeah like I said this is generally
playing<00:03:05.330> catch-up<00:03:05.570> games<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.680> mirrors

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
playing catch-up games with the mirrors

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
playing catch-up games with the mirrors
at<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.550> front<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.940> pack<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.480> take<00:03:09.230> over

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
at the front of the pack I take over

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.280 
at the front of the pack I take over
that<00:03:09.590> guy<00:03:09.739> on<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.860> last<00:03:10.100> lap<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.110> not<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
that guy on the last lap and not the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
that guy on the last lap and not the
biggest<00:03:12.620> challenge<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.370> first<00:03:13.610> race<00:03:13.880> but

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
biggest challenge that first race but

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.380 
biggest challenge that first race but
you<00:03:14.510> might<00:03:14.780> take<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> couple<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.350> goes<00:03:16.390> second

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
you might take a couple of goes second

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.449 
you might take a couple of goes second
track<00:03:17.570> then<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.320> special<00:03:18.800> stage<00:03:18.980> route<00:03:19.220> 5

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
track then is the special stage route 5

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.580 
track then is the special stage route 5
now<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.420> pretty<00:03:20.630> much<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.080> same<00:03:21.260> sort<00:03:21.470> of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
now this is pretty much the same sort of

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.229 
now this is pretty much the same sort of
games<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.100> roam<00:03:22.280> circuit<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.060> about

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
games the roam circuit it's all about

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.820 
games the roam circuit it's all about
getting<00:03:23.480> your<00:03:23.600> lines<00:03:23.870> right<00:03:24.230> trying<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.769> to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
chicane ins like this again important to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.390 
chicane ins like this again important to
get<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.900> line<00:03:42.110> right<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.739> sometimes<00:03:43.250> it

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
get the line right this sometimes it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.890 
get the line right this sometimes it
takes<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.670> little<00:03:43.790> practice<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
takes a little practice just to get the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.300 
takes a little practice just to get the
right<00:03:45.050> speed<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.560> come<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.100> with<00:03:46.190> that

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
right speed to come in and with that

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.340 
right speed to come in and with that
sorts<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.640> things<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.420> first<00:03:47.660> corner<00:03:48.110> here

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
sorts of things this first corner here

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.870 
sorts of things this first corner here
after<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.860> straight<00:03:49.130> just<00:03:49.459> watch<00:03:49.610> out

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
after the straight just watch out

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.570 
after the straight just watch out
because<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.989> AI<00:03:51.140> for<00:03:51.560> some<00:03:51.769> reason<00:03:52.220> tend

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
because the the AI for some reason tend

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.640 
because the the AI for some reason tend
to<00:03:52.760> lose<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> lot<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.300> grip<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.930> corner<00:03:54.350> and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
to lose a lot of grip on that corner and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.220 
to lose a lot of grip on that corner and
actually<00:03:55.190> it's<00:03:55.370> sort<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.640> veer<00:03:55.910> outwards<00:03:56.480> they

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
actually it's sort of veer outwards they

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.620 
actually it's sort of veer outwards they
kind<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.530> skid<00:03:57.800> around<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.310> bit<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:59.540> if

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
kind of skid around a little bit so if

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.600 
kind of skid around a little bit so if
you're<00:03:59.810> coming<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.140> real<00:04:00.320> quick<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.830> there<00:04:01.040> you

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
you're coming in real quick in there you

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.490 
you're coming in real quick in there you
can<00:04:01.820> actually<00:04:02.000> end<00:04:02.299> up<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:02.630> t-boning<00:04:03.110> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
can actually end up just t-boning and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.280 
can actually end up just t-boning and
right<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.070> side<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.580> complete

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
right in the side and it complete

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.280 
right in the side and it complete

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
know dodgy AIS come around that corner I

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.140 
know dodgy AIS come around that corner I
take<00:04:11.409> first<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:11.980> last<00:04:12.159> lap<00:04:12.519> put<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.819> little

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
take first on the last lap put a little

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.490 
take first on the last lap put a little
way<00:04:13.390> around<00:04:13.659> maybe<00:04:13.870> halfway<00:04:14.109> around<00:04:14.349> the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
way around maybe halfway around the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.509 
way around maybe halfway around the
track<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.539> again<00:04:16.739> no<00:04:17.739> don't<00:04:18.280> want<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.459> be

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
track so again no don't want to be

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.759 
track so again no don't want to be
making<00:04:18.729> too<00:04:18.940> many<00:04:19.120> errors<00:04:19.299> now<00:04:19.989> third<00:04:20.500> track

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
making too many errors now third track

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.920 
making too many errors now third track
in<00:04:21.009> this<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.489> autumn<00:04:21.880> ring<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.660> one

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
in this is the autumn ring this is one

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.480 
in this is the autumn ring this is one
of<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.169> more<00:04:23.380> challenging<00:04:23.650> ones<00:04:23.979> this<00:04:24.310> took

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
of the more challenging ones this took

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.020 
of the more challenging ones this took
me<00:04:24.669> several<00:04:25.210> attempts<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.080> right<00:04:26.789> this<00:04:27.789> is

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
me several attempts to get right this is

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.749 
me several attempts to get right this is
uh<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.860> would<00:04:29.860> say<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.340> more<00:04:30.490> challenging

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
uh I would say this is more challenging

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.279 
uh I would say this is more challenging
because<00:04:31.240> if<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.449> go<00:04:31.600> off<00:04:31.780> you've<00:04:31.990> got<00:04:32.020> the

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
because if you go off you've got the

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.290 
because if you go off you've got the
grass<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.830> then<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.039> causes<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.430> spin<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
grass and then it causes you to spin and

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.029 
grass and then it causes you to spin and
all<00:04:34.720> sorts<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.169> things<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.919> it's

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
all sorts of things like that so it's

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.300 
all sorts of things like that so it's
really<00:04:36.220> important<00:04:36.759> that<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:38.020> try<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:38.320> keep

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
really important that you try and keep

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
really important that you try and keep
control<00:04:39.789> of<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.060> car<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:40.360> best<00:04:40.539> as<00:04:40.599> you<00:04:40.660> can

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
control of the car as best as you can

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.510 
control of the car as best as you can
don't<00:04:41.169> try<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.500> let<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.680> slip<00:04:41.949> out<00:04:42.130> too<00:04:42.370> much

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
don't try and let it slip out too much

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.029 
don't try and let it slip out too much
because<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.940> will<00:04:43.120> do<00:04:43.300> its<00:04:43.449> best<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.919> try<00:04:44.919> and

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
because it will do its best to try and

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.589 
because it will do its best to try and
get<00:04:45.160> its<00:04:45.250> get<00:04:45.550> out<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.699> actually<00:04:45.970> ended<00:04:46.449> up

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
get its get out I actually ended up

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.420 
get its get out I actually ended up
playing<00:04:47.020> some<00:04:47.349> really<00:04:47.530> aggressive<00:04:47.919> not

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
playing some really aggressive not

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.300 
playing some really aggressive not
trying<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:48.820> be<00:04:48.940> too<00:04:49.440> gentle<00:04:50.440> with<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.770> car<00:04:50.979> all

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
trying to be too gentle with the car all

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.370 
trying to be too gentle with the car all
with<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.669> opponents<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.360> used<00:04:52.990> them<00:04:53.229> as

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
with the opponents I used them as

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.680 
with the opponents I used them as
barriers<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.039> some<00:04:54.250> situations<00:04:54.940> just<00:04:55.330> really

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
barriers in some situations just really

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.219 
barriers in some situations just really
threw<00:04:55.960> around<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.440> corners<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:58.810> there's

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
threw around the corners if there's

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.659 
threw around the corners if there's
little<00:04:59.470> areas<00:04:59.770> where<00:04:59.889> you<00:04:59.979> can<00:05:00.130> just<00:05:00.310> cut<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
little areas where you can just cut the

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.850 
little areas where you can just cut the
corner<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.300> keep<00:05:01.479> your<00:05:01.599> line<00:05:01.840> straighter<00:05:02.380> then

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
corner to keep your line straighter then

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.830 
corner to keep your line straighter then
by<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:03.490> means<00:05:03.669> do<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.090> especially<00:05:04.419> if<00:05:04.750> you

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
by all means do that especially if you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.060 
by all means do that especially if you
see<00:05:04.990> through<00:05:05.199> these<00:05:05.349> through<00:05:05.560> canes<00:05:05.800> here

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
see through these through canes here

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.230 
see through these through canes here
just<00:05:06.340> pop<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.970> corners<00:05:08.639> try<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:09.760> keep<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:10.000> as

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
just pop the corners try and keep it as

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.689 
just pop the corners try and keep it as
straight<00:05:10.449> as<00:05:10.750> possible<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:12.310> can<00:05:12.490> see

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
straight as possible and you can see

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.219 
straight as possible and you can see
here<00:05:12.849> the<00:05:12.970> mirrors<00:05:13.330> put<00:05:13.479> up<00:05:13.599> a<00:05:13.780> really<00:05:13.990> good

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
here the mirrors put up a really good

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.779 
here the mirrors put up a really good
fight<00:05:14.289> I've<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:14.919> done<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.130> little<00:05:15.220> speed<00:05:15.639> up

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
fight I've just done a little speed up

thing just take your time as long as

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.890 
thing just take your time as long as

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
you're keeping lap times fast you don't

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.330 
you're keeping lap times fast you don't
need<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.199> try<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.500> push<00:05:20.650> with<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:20.949> overtake

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
need to try and push with you overtake

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.620 
need to try and push with you overtake
that's<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.699> main<00:05:21.909> thing<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.300> keep<00:05:22.449> your

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
that's the main thing just keep your

that's the main thing just keep your
time's<00:05:22.840> up<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.289> you'll<00:05:24.039> catch<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.430> guy<00:05:24.610> I

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
time's up and you'll catch the guy I

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.050 
time's up and you'll catch the guy I
took<00:05:25.690> first<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.440> few<00:05:27.159> corners<00:05:27.370> remaining<00:05:27.909> there

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
took first a few corners remaining there

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.600 
took first a few corners remaining there
on<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.270> last<00:05:28.479> lap<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.889> trickier<00:05:30.430> one

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
on the last lap that is a trickier one

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.850 
on the last lap that is a trickier one
though<00:05:30.789> your<00:05:31.330> fourth<00:05:31.539> race<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:31.960> single<00:05:32.680> lap

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
though your fourth race is a single lap

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.890 
though your fourth race is a single lap
of<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.490> hold<00:05:33.729> of<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.849> Nurburgring<00:05:34.539> this<00:05:34.720> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
of the hold of the Nurburgring this is

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.100 
of the hold of the Nurburgring this is
again<00:05:35.889> one<00:05:36.490> of<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.669> tougher<00:05:37.000> ones<00:05:37.210> just

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
again one of the tougher ones just

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.140 
again one of the tougher ones just
purely<00:05:38.500> because<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.979> Nurburgring<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.820> pretty

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
purely because the Nurburgring is pretty

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.320 
purely because the Nurburgring is pretty
grueling<00:05:40.560> if<00:05:41.560> you're<00:05:41.740> not<00:05:42.039> that<00:05:42.490> experienced

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
grueling if you're not that experienced

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.089 
grueling if you're not that experienced
at<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:43.780> game<00:05:43.960> then<00:05:44.260> it's<00:05:44.409> a<00:05:44.590> really<00:05:44.800> tough<00:05:45.039> one

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
at the game then it's a really tough one

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.800 
at the game then it's a really tough one
to<00:05:45.400> complete<00:05:45.729> without<00:05:46.000> actually<00:05:46.449> coming<00:05:46.750> off

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
to complete without actually coming off

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.230 
to complete without actually coming off
the<00:05:46.960> course<00:05:47.169> too<00:05:47.380> many<00:05:47.530> times<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:48.099> found<00:05:49.060> with

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
the course too many times I found with

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.050 
the course too many times I found with
this<00:05:49.360> actually<00:05:49.780> if<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.500> did<00:05:50.710> make<00:05:50.949> maybe<00:05:51.699> more

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
this actually if you did make maybe more

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.690 
this actually if you did make maybe more
than<00:05:52.180> one

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
than one

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.320 
than one
or<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:53.090> sort<00:05:53.510> of<00:05:53.570> major<00:05:54.080> well<00:05:55.010> one<00:05:55.640> major<00:05:55.970> or

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
or to sort of major well one major or

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.780 
or to sort of major well one major or
maybe<00:05:56.540> two<00:05:56.900> minor<00:05:57.350> slips<00:05:57.860> off<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.130> track<00:05:58.550> you

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
maybe two minor slips off the track you

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.640 
maybe two minor slips off the track you
probably<00:05:59.300> not<00:05:59.570> have<00:05:59.750> enough<00:06:00.020> time<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.470> catch

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
probably not have enough time to catch

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.800 
probably not have enough time to catch
up<00:06:00.860> with<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:01.070> guy<00:06:01.190> on<00:06:01.220> first<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.880> think<00:06:02.450> I<00:06:02.570> might

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
up with the guy on first I think I might

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.930 
up with the guy on first I think I might
have<00:06:02.840> came<00:06:03.200> off<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.530> track<00:06:03.740> once<00:06:04.250> in<00:06:04.580> a<00:06:04.640> very

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
have came off the track once in a very

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.970 
have came off the track once in a very
minor<00:06:05.420> way<00:06:05.890> near<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.130> long<00:06:07.550> source<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:09.710> fast

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
minor way near the long source the fast

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.110 
minor way near the long source the fast
source<00:06:10.460> windy<00:06:11.360> section<00:06:11.810> near<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.050> end<00:06:12.580> and<00:06:13.580> I

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
source windy section near the end and I

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.570 
source windy section near the end and I
managed<00:06:14.420> to<00:06:14.470> just<00:06:15.470> about<00:06:15.710> keep<00:06:15.950> the<00:06:16.070> car<00:06:16.280> on

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
managed to just about keep the car on

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.330 
managed to just about keep the car on
the<00:06:16.730> track<00:06:16.940> and<00:06:17.420> not<00:06:17.600> too<00:06:17.870> many<00:06:17.960> errors<00:06:18.340> the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
the track and not too many errors the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.620 
the track and not too many errors the
problem<00:06:19.610> this<00:06:19.730> I<00:06:19.880> can't<00:06:20.090> really<00:06:20.210> go<00:06:20.420> through

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
problem this I can't really go through

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.240 
problem this I can't really go through
corner<00:06:20.990> by<00:06:21.110> corner<00:06:21.170> because<00:06:21.680> there's<00:06:21.830> just<00:06:21.890> so

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
corner by corner because there's just so

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.620 
corner by corner because there's just so
many<00:06:22.400> sections<00:06:22.760> which<00:06:23.060> you<00:06:23.210> need<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.390> watch

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
many sections which you need to watch

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.970 
many sections which you need to watch
out<00:06:23.840> for<00:06:24.020> this<00:06:24.170> is<00:06:24.320> just<00:06:24.530> going<00:06:24.620> to<00:06:24.680> be<00:06:24.800> about

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
out for this is just going to be about

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.950 
out for this is just going to be about
knowing<00:06:25.400> your<00:06:25.610> your<00:06:26.180> knowing<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.720> track

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
knowing your your knowing the track

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.930 
knowing your your knowing the track
really<00:06:27.260> know<00:06:27.860> in<00:06:28.040> the<00:06:28.160> course<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.670> knowing

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
really know in the course and knowing

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.360 
really know in the course and knowing
how<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.150> car<00:06:29.420> is<00:06:29.570> going<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.780> go<00:06:29.930> around<00:06:30.140> it

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
how the car is going to go around it

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.500 
how the car is going to go around it
probably<00:06:31.370> will<00:06:31.490> take<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:31.760> several<00:06:32.060> tries<00:06:32.270> so

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
probably will take you several tries so

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.330 
probably will take you several tries so
what<00:06:32.630> I've<00:06:32.720> done<00:06:32.870> is<00:06:32.930> just<00:06:33.080> shown<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.620> roughly

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
what I've done is just shown you roughly

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.160 
what I've done is just shown you roughly
at<00:06:34.550> certain<00:06:34.850> points<00:06:35.180> where<00:06:35.390> I'm<00:06:35.540> overtaking

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
at certain points where I'm overtaking

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.330 
at certain points where I'm overtaking
people<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:36.620> so<00:06:36.680> you<00:06:36.740> can<00:06:36.860> get<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.040> rough<00:06:37.160> idea

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
people and so you can get a rough idea

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.690 
people and so you can get a rough idea
of<00:06:37.550> how<00:06:37.610> fast<00:06:37.970> you<00:06:38.180> need<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.450> be<00:06:39.460> as<00:06:40.460> you<00:06:40.580> can

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
of how fast you need to be as you can

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.390 
of how fast you need to be as you can
see<00:06:40.850> into<00:06:41.060> second<00:06:41.480> here<00:06:41.750> about<00:06:42.590> six<00:06:42.890> six

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
see into second here about six six

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.370 
see into second here about six six
minutes<00:06:43.760> I<00:06:43.910> catch<00:06:44.360> up<00:06:44.390> with<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:44.870> first<00:06:45.080> guide

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
minutes I catch up with the first guide

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.370 
minutes I catch up with the first guide
just<00:06:45.800> on<00:06:46.040> the<00:06:46.160> second<00:06:46.550> last<00:06:46.670> corner<00:06:47.120> before

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
just on the second last corner before

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.840 
just on the second last corner before
the<00:06:48.670> final<00:06:49.670> back<00:06:49.880> straight<00:06:50.860> now<00:06:51.860> don't<00:06:52.550> take

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
the final back straight now don't take

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.400 
the final back straight now don't take
it<00:06:53.060> for<00:06:53.210> granted<00:06:53.240> that<00:06:53.600> you've<00:06:53.870> won<00:06:54.110> if<00:06:54.290> you

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
it for granted that you've won if you

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.990 
it for granted that you've won if you
can<00:06:54.530> get<00:06:54.710> past<00:06:54.890> him<00:06:55.190> by<00:06:55.340> the<00:06:55.400> straight<00:06:55.760> because

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
can get past him by the straight because

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.490 
can get past him by the straight because
he<00:06:56.090> will<00:06:56.270> actually<00:06:56.600> stay<00:06:56.810> right<00:06:57.020> on<00:06:57.080> your<00:06:57.260> tail

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
he will actually stay right on your tail

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.770 
he will actually stay right on your tail
the<00:06:57.830> way<00:06:57.920> down<00:06:58.130> the<00:06:58.310> straight<00:06:58.610> if<00:06:59.420> you're<00:06:59.600> not

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
the way down the straight if you're not

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.510 
the way down the straight if you're not
confident<00:07:00.200> about<00:07:00.350> going<00:07:00.650> fast<00:07:00.980> through<00:07:01.370> these

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
confident about going fast through these

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.880 
confident about going fast through these
last<00:07:01.760> few<00:07:02.000> corners<00:07:02.380> it's<00:07:03.380> not<00:07:03.530> the<00:07:03.620> biggest

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
last few corners it's not the biggest

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.320 
last few corners it's not the biggest
problem<00:07:03.950> because<00:07:04.370> it's<00:07:04.520> so<00:07:04.670> narrow<00:07:04.910> it'll<00:07:05.240> be

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
problem because it's so narrow it'll be

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.760 
problem because it's so narrow it'll be
tricky<00:07:05.540> for<00:07:05.750> him<00:07:05.840> to<00:07:05.960> get<00:07:06.080> round<00:07:06.290> but<00:07:06.470> just

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
tricky for him to get round but just

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.290 
tricky for him to get round but just
watch<00:07:06.950> out<00:07:07.190> you<00:07:07.310> don't<00:07:07.520> want<00:07:07.670> to<00:07:07.760> just<00:07:07.880> go<00:07:08.030> full

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
watch out you don't want to just go full

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.120 
watch out you don't want to just go full
on<00:07:08.360> safety<00:07:08.930> mode<00:07:09.110> because<00:07:09.410> he<00:07:09.560> might<00:07:09.770> just

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
on safety mode because he might just

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.640 
on safety mode because he might just
sneak<00:07:10.370> up<00:07:10.550> on<00:07:10.730> you<00:07:10.850> and<00:07:11.000> if<00:07:11.840> you<00:07:11.960> slip<00:07:12.260> up<00:07:12.410> he

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
sneak up on you and if you slip up he

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.500 
sneak up on you and if you slip up he
probably<00:07:12.860> will<00:07:13.340> take<00:07:13.880> your<00:07:14.060> first<00:07:14.240> place

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 
probably will take your first place

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.629 
probably will take your first place

this
halfway<00:07:46.529> through<00:07:46.999> ended<00:07:47.999> up<00:07:48.120> on<00:07:48.300> my<00:07:48.449> side<00:07:48.689> a

halfway through ended up on my side a
little<00:07:48.990> bit<00:07:49.819> back<00:07:50.819> onto<00:07:51.120> all<00:07:51.270> four<00:07:51.629> wheels<00:07:51.840> and

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:52.289 
little bit back onto all four wheels and

00:07:58.459 --> 00:07:58.469 
first place so you can see that is

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:01.100 
first place so you can see that is
really<00:07:59.039> not<00:07:59.159> the<00:07:59.340> most<00:07:59.849> difficult<00:08:00.419> of<00:08:00.539> of

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.110 
really not the most difficult of of
