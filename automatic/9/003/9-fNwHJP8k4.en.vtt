well it's kind of technical at the
moment<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> hitting<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.719> engineers<00:01:05.330> idea<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
moment to hitting some engineers idea of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
moment to hitting some engineers idea of
what<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> big<00:01:06.930> hole<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> ground<00:01:07.620> hold<00:01:08.130> that

what a big hole in the ground hold that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
what a big hole in the ground hold that
once<00:01:08.850> once<00:01:09.600> every<00:01:09.840> hundred<00:01:09.990> years<00:01:10.320> flood

once once every hundred years flood

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
once once every hundred years flood
should<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.719> we're<00:01:12.719> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> take<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
should look like we're going to take it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.889 
should look like we're going to take it
and<00:01:13.500> mold<00:01:14.219> it<00:01:14.369> slightly<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:15.119> our<00:01:15.329> version

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
and mold it slightly into our version

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.130 
and mold it slightly into our version
it's<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.740> more<00:01:16.950> organic<00:01:17.579> and
