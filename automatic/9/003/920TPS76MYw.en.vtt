00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.040
 towards a player 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.570
 who was sore big and caused a furore in 2006 and 2007 at young orange there wild 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.750
 rather he was decisive on both tournaments and was therefore twice 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.200
 European champion and also has Israeli it radiates S6 out of each 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.560
 year you go on holiday in the cell and that is not only because of the nice weather 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.789
 a mother who and that is so and I have you that is quite a lot of family 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 and made good friends 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.590
 they come in the name but then search 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.369
 in the summer you can also just 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 nice country to celebrate a holiday 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.470
 You don't get that if they are like people who have never known 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.320
 his designs falls the idea that we have a big battlefield there of course there are 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.000
 things and areas 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.620
 you better avoid 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.650
 but of course that for example is a reasonable chance that step too far 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.170
 why if you are 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.260
 yes is gelderland of almost 8 million inhabitants with people from 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.990
 russia almost 2 million i believe arabs form more group 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.300
 the the people and animal families that were already much longer the three are chin 8 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.210
 how is that the new proposal a high debt football through it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710
 but i think you are in a football name despite the garden stories 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 Jerusalem last season 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.900
 The past season is whether that is very good when I wonder if 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 Willem II played stories and architecture 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.960
 and that was the year after that 7 6 paradise boys with Jewish boys played with 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.870
 these christian boys 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.090
 everything together and for that matter is naturally the perfect way to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.650
 tie 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.969
 we know everything went well 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.460
 as a sport country in the netherlands more of basketball and in it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 brings the country more out how big football is missing out 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 ksv from the greatest sport that is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.479
 the net also about for example the basketball player they are better and we are 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.400
 another success 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.650
 but going out after this goal 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.740
 who everyone loves football and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.890
 internationally about the goal they even follow closely in spain 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 The Netherlands 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 in England 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.450
 it is an absolute football crazy country for that matter 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.640
 and the ten marks of the shell 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 they names that don't tell us so much of course you think more 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.799
 if she's with from boys to boys from 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.159
 different backgrounds and requires money 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.829
 the boys of painting club storytellers 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.519
 I have to say I became the lesser than young orange but I do know one 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.019
 number of good names 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.019
 2 percent of the boys and I think that's the past 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.709
 always has ten years 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.189
 brought forth 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.819
 The problem is that I think what they have is that they are not that strong in a team 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.809
 to be 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:35.649
 just out 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.509
 in a team, the plug is unplugged, there is European 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.819
 championship a spark at a world cup with the first team while both 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.309
 Guys like Ben have the young running and and players who look at the 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.079
 first 11 rounds in the highest competition in europe 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.489
 so it would be 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.540
 The screen should be feasible and I just couldn't do it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.919
 experience 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.619
 no 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.089
 the successes of excesses can also be booked within a team 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.729
