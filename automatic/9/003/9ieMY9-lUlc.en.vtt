explaining one of its old prototypes
that<00:00:38.610> obviously<00:00:39.300> did<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.540> work<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.710> keeps

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that obviously did not work but he keeps

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
that obviously did not work but he keeps
on<00:00:41.190> trying<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.879> never<00:00:42.090> gives<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.079> long

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
on trying and never gives up not as long

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.130

okay<00:00:51.579> this<00:00:52.579> is<00:00:53.379> just<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.500> setup<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:55.160> my<00:00:55.850> magnetic

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
okay this is just a setup of my magnetic

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.080 
okay this is just a setup of my magnetic
generator<00:00:57.160> just<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.309> give<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.489> an<00:00:58.579> idea<00:00:58.670> of

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
generator just to give you an idea of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.229 
generator just to give you an idea of
what's<00:00:59.300> going<00:00:59.449> on<00:00:59.629> here<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.579> basically<00:01:01.579> have

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
what's going on here I basically have

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.140 
what's going on here I basically have
three<00:01:02.659> stat<00:01:03.050> errs<00:01:03.489> 1<00:01:04.489> 2<00:01:05.710> 3<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.729> they<00:01:07.880> each<00:01:08.119> have

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
three stat errs 1 2 3 and they each have

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.580 
three stat errs 1 2 3 and they each have
magnets<00:01:09.050> on<00:01:09.200> them<00:01:10.240> starting<00:01:11.240> with<00:01:11.270> 5<00:01:11.690> magnets

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
magnets on them starting with 5 magnets

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
magnets on them starting with 5 magnets
going<00:01:13.520> all<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.940> way<00:01:13.970> up<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.270> 18<00:01:14.780> magnets<00:01:15.610> over

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
going all the way up to 18 magnets over

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.120 
going all the way up to 18 magnets over
here<00:01:16.820> at<00:01:16.909> around<00:01:17.060> 3<00:01:17.390> o'clock<00:01:17.420> 2<00:01:17.990> o'clock<00:01:18.130> then

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
here at around 3 o'clock 2 o'clock then

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.880 
here at around 3 o'clock 2 o'clock then
they<00:01:19.250> taper<00:01:19.910> back<00:01:20.180> down<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:21.170> 16<00:01:21.710> 14<00:01:22.460> eight<00:01:23.890> six

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
they taper back down to 16 14 eight six

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.490 
they taper back down to 16 14 eight six
and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:25.399> five<00:01:25.700> again<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:27.140> I'll<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.470> a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
and then five again and then I'll have a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.180 
and then five again and then I'll have a
magnet<00:01:28.009> here<00:01:28.369> on<00:01:28.580> top<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.890> it'll<00:01:30.890> want<00:01:31.100> to

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
magnet here on top and it it'll want to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.760 
magnet here on top and it it'll want to
go<00:01:31.479> like<00:01:32.479> I'll<00:01:32.600> have<00:01:32.750> like<00:01:32.869> magnets<00:01:33.289> from<00:01:33.440> here

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
go like I'll have like magnets from here

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.469 
go like I'll have like magnets from here
to<00:01:34.039> here<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.520> third<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.090> wheel<00:01:35.240> will<00:01:35.450> be

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
to here a third of the wheel will be

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.419 
to here a third of the wheel will be
taking<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.899> with<00:01:35.990> magnets<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.679> it'll<00:01:37.160> want<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
taking up with magnets and it'll want to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.880 
taking up with magnets and it'll want to
track<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.970> most<00:01:38.149> strongest<00:01:38.780> part<00:01:39.229> go<00:01:39.800> all

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
track to the most strongest part go all

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.080 
track to the most strongest part go all
the<00:01:39.979> way<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.220> last<00:01:40.399> magnet<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.030> then

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the way to the last magnet and then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.910 
the way to the last magnet and then
these<00:01:41.210> will<00:01:41.390> be<00:01:41.450> down<00:01:41.750> here<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
these will be down here and that and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.740 
these will be down here and that and
then<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.490> will<00:01:43.670> stop<00:01:43.940> but<00:01:44.420> I'll<00:01:44.570> have

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
then that that will stop but I'll have

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.320 
then that that will stop but I'll have
the<00:01:44.899> same<00:01:45.080> thing<00:01:45.700> behind<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:48.550> let's<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.789> on

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
the same thing behind it let's see on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.779 
the same thing behind it let's see on
the<00:01:50.509> second<00:01:50.899> one<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:52.069> on<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.340> third<00:01:52.580> one

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
the second one and then on the third one

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.240 
the second one and then on the third one
all<00:01:53.030> offset<00:01:53.660> by<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> third<00:01:54.319> so<00:01:54.950> they'll<00:01:55.099> all

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
all offset by a third so they'll all

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.070 
all offset by a third so they'll all
want<00:01:55.489> to<00:01:55.670> do<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.910> same<00:01:56.209> thing<00:01:56.479> reach<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.989> the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
want to do the same thing reach to the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.320 
want to do the same thing reach to the
strongest<00:01:57.410> magnet<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:58.459> have<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> flywheel

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
strongest magnet now I have a flywheel

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.820 
strongest magnet now I have a flywheel
in<00:01:59.630> between<00:01:59.989> each<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.200> these<00:02:00.410> these<00:02:00.679> aren't

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
in between each of these these aren't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.990 
in between each of these these aren't
attached<00:02:01.130> yet<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.459> I'm<00:02:01.520> just<00:02:01.670> showing<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
attached yet so I'm just showing this

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.339 
attached yet so I'm just showing this
for<00:02:02.149> demonstration<00:02:02.630> purposes<00:02:02.989> I<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
for demonstration purposes I have to

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.979 
for demonstration purposes I have to
bolt<00:02:04.099> them<00:02:04.250> all<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.849> make<00:02:05.720> them<00:02:05.869> all

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
bolt them all in and make them all

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.499 
bolt them all in and make them all
perfect<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.009> anyways<00:02:07.849> these<00:02:08.060> other<00:02:08.300> ones

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
perfect but anyways these other ones

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.809 
perfect but anyways these other ones
will<00:02:08.720> spin<00:02:09.020> as<00:02:09.170> well<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.830> they'll<00:02:10.220> cause<00:02:10.429> it

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
will spin as well and they'll cause it

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.760 
will spin as well and they'll cause it
to<00:02:11.030> be<00:02:11.270> like<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> fly<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.020> have<00:02:12.230> heavy<00:02:12.470> heavy

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
to be like a fly we all have heavy heavy

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.559 
to be like a fly we all have heavy heavy
weight<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.430> hopefully<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:14.000> enough<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.330> get<00:02:14.450> it

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
weight and hopefully be enough to get it

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.040 
weight and hopefully be enough to get it
from<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.989> locking<00:02:15.950> phase<00:02:16.540> over<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.959> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
from the locking phase over to the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.140 
from the locking phase over to the
beginning<00:02:18.349> phase<00:02:18.560> again<00:02:18.739> now<00:02:19.520> each<00:02:19.849> of<00:02:19.879> these

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
beginning phase again now each of these

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.030 
beginning phase again now each of these
i've<00:02:20.450> used<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.750> square<00:02:20.989> instead<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.770> circle

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
i've used a square instead of a circle

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.660 
i've used a square instead of a circle
because<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.849> square<00:02:23.120> has<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> own<00:02:23.950> thumb<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
because a square has a own thumb to it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.190 
because a square has a own thumb to it
each<00:02:26.060> time<00:02:26.330> as<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.510> goes<00:02:26.660> around<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.050> got<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
each time as it goes around it's got a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.479 
each time as it goes around it's got a
little<00:02:27.290> bit<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.560> kick<00:02:27.830> because<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
little bit of a kick because of the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.940 
little bit of a kick because of the
corner<00:02:28.819> weight<00:02:28.970> now<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.140> top<00:02:30.379> of<00:02:30.650> each

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
corner weight now at the top of each

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.059 
corner weight now at the top of each
square<00:02:31.239> there'd<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> magnet<00:02:32.930> which<00:02:33.860> one

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
square there'd be a magnet which one

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.500 
square there'd be a magnet which one
there'll<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.310> bar<00:02:34.580> going<00:02:34.730> across<00:02:34.879> from<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
there'll be a bar going across from the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.170 
there'll be a bar going across from the
end<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.349> top<00:02:36.590> hovering<00:02:37.489> through

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
end to the top hovering through

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.820 
end to the top hovering through
repulsive<00:02:38.870> magnets<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.319> hovering<00:02:39.620> they're

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
repulsive magnets is hovering they're

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.100 
repulsive magnets is hovering they're
screwed<00:02:40.220> at<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> back<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.879> then<00:02:41.629> every<00:02:41.959> time

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
screwed at the back and then every time

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.320 
screwed at the back and then every time
this<00:02:42.260> goes<00:02:42.440> around<00:02:42.590> it'll<00:02:43.040> cause<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.580> little

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
this goes around it'll cause this little

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.350 
this goes around it'll cause this little
bar<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.780> bounce<00:02:45.019> up<00:02:45.349> in<00:02:46.010> repulsion<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.849> will

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
bar to bounce up in repulsion and will

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.360 
bar to bounce up in repulsion and will
oscillate<00:02:47.569> up<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.319> up<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:48.890> up<00:02:49.010> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
oscillate up and down up and down up and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.050 
oscillate up and down up and down up and
down<00:02:50.200> now<00:02:51.200> there'll<00:02:51.620> be<00:02:51.650> another<00:02:51.950> real<00:02:52.640> way

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
down now there'll be another real way

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.699 
down now there'll be another real way
out<00:02:53.209> here<00:02:53.629> imagine<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.250> further

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
out here imagine if this was out further

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
out here imagine if this was out further
now<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.819> thing<00:02:57.060> will<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.299> bouncing<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
now this thing will be bouncing up and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
now this thing will be bouncing up and
down<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.760> repulsion

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
down and in repulsion

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880 
down and in repulsion
it'll<00:03:00.659> help<00:03:00.750> be<00:03:00.930> pushing<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.379> other<00:03:01.620> wheel

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it'll help be pushing this other wheel

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.709 
it'll help be pushing this other wheel
round<00:03:02.750> bouncy<00:03:03.750> bouncy<00:03:04.349> bouncy<00:03:04.709> bouncy<00:03:05.719> so

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
round bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy so

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.140 
round bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy so
that's<00:03:06.870> my<00:03:07.049> basic<00:03:07.680> idea<00:03:08.099> now<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.969> other

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's my basic idea now I do have other

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.429 
that's my basic idea now I do have other
ideas<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.719> build<00:03:09.930> upon<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.469> by<00:03:11.010> using<00:03:11.219> a

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
ideas to build upon that by using a

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.009 
ideas to build upon that by using a
magneto<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:15.180> I'm<00:03:15.299> gonna<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.689> from<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
magneto that I'm gonna get from this

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.970 
magneto that I'm gonna get from this
weed<00:03:16.319> whacker<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:18.239> magneto<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.049> hook<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.829> up

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
weed whacker this magneto and hook it up

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.539 
weed whacker this magneto and hook it up
to<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:21.180> magnets<00:03:21.659> on<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.379> bouncy<00:03:22.829> wheel<00:03:23.010> so

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
to the magnets on the bouncy wheel so

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.490 
to the magnets on the bouncy wheel so
every<00:03:23.760> time<00:03:23.939> the<00:03:24.120> Magnus<00:03:24.450> go<00:03:24.569> past<00:03:24.900> it'll

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
every time the Magnus go past it'll

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.610 
every time the Magnus go past it'll
collect<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.920> spark<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.579> charge<00:03:27.269> now<00:03:28.139> instead<00:03:28.560> of

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
collect a spark a charge now instead of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.399 
collect a spark a charge now instead of
putting<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.090> charge<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:32.840> spark<00:03:33.840> plug<00:03:33.900> I

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
putting that charge to a spark plug I

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.089 
putting that charge to a spark plug I
will<00:03:35.370> put<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.450> an<00:03:36.629> electoral<00:03:37.019> magnet<00:03:37.530> which

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
will put it to an electoral magnet which

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.970 
will put it to an electoral magnet which
will<00:03:38.310> also<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:39.090> here<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.620> horseshoe

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
will also be on here in a horseshoe

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.720 
will also be on here in a horseshoe
fashion<00:03:41.849> which<00:03:42.419> will<00:03:43.040> push<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.219> down<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
fashion which will push it down and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.659 
fashion which will push it down and
attract<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.599> forward<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.169> I'll<00:03:46.260> put<00:03:46.469> it<00:03:46.560> around

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
attract it forward so I'll put it around

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.780 
attract it forward so I'll put it around
got<00:03:47.669> on<00:03:47.790> all<00:03:47.909> two<00:03:48.090> o'clock<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:50.549> it'll

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
got on all two o'clock or so so it'll

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.610 
got on all two o'clock or so so it'll
track<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.329> 12<00:03:51.870> o'clock<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.439> 1<00:03:52.469> o'clock

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
track it from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.110 
track it from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock
and<00:03:53.219> then<00:03:53.519> 2<00:03:53.730> o'clock

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
and then 2 o'clock

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.809 
and then 2 o'clock
it'll<00:03:54.780> be<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.439> horseshoe<00:03:55.950> magnet<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.459> repulse

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
it'll be a horseshoe magnet and repulse

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.180 
it'll be a horseshoe magnet and repulse
it<00:03:57.060> I'm<00:03:57.450> using<00:03:57.719> a<00:03:58.019> little<00:03:58.530> clamp<00:03:58.919> from<00:03:59.189> a<00:04:01.190> you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it I'm using a little clamp from a you

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.680 
it I'm using a little clamp from a you
know<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> horseshoe<00:04:02.699> clamp<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.329> your<00:04:03.449> muffler

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
know a horseshoe clamp for your muffler

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.159 
know a horseshoe clamp for your muffler
system

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
system

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.839 
system
I<00:04:04.319> got<00:04:04.680> wires<00:04:04.859> all<00:04:05.069> wrapped<00:04:05.310> around<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.760> so

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
I got wires all wrapped around it so

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.699 
I got wires all wrapped around it so
it'll<00:04:05.940> turn<00:04:06.150> into<00:04:06.209> electro<00:04:06.780> magnet<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.560> one

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
it'll turn into electro magnet so one

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.140 
it'll turn into electro magnet so one
side<00:04:07.919> will<00:04:08.069> be<00:04:08.099> positive<00:04:08.190> one<00:04:08.790> side<00:04:08.970> would<00:04:09.090> be

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
side will be positive one side would be

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.849 
side will be positive one side would be
negative<00:04:09.540> now<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> use<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.139> one<00:04:10.409> side<00:04:10.650> to

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
negative now I use that one side to

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.979 
negative now I use that one side to
attract<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.549> other<00:04:11.699> side<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> repulse

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
attract and the other side to repulse

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.379 
attract and the other side to repulse
and<00:04:13.379> that'll<00:04:14.040> turn<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.340> wheel<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:14.669> well<00:04:14.879> now

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
and that'll turn the wheel as well now

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.629 
and that'll turn the wheel as well now
I've<00:04:15.510> left<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.840> space<00:04:16.079> over<00:04:16.380> here<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
I've left a space over here for a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.930 
I've left a space over here for a
pendulum<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.539> swing<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.370> pendulum<00:04:20.729> when

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
pendulum to swing now this pendulum when

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.659 
pendulum to swing now this pendulum when
it<00:04:21.090> swings<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:22.560> will<00:04:22.740> create<00:04:23.099> a<00:04:23.250> pumping

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
it swings it will create a pumping

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.490 
it swings it will create a pumping
action<00:04:23.820> I'm<00:04:24.180> also<00:04:24.360> might<00:04:24.630> do<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:24.960> top<00:04:25.199> not

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
action I'm also might do it on top not

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.939 
action I'm also might do it on top not
sure<00:04:25.740> yet<00:04:25.949> but<00:04:26.159> this<00:04:27.060> will<00:04:27.240> cause<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:27.949> can

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
sure yet but this will cause this I can

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.029 
sure yet but this will cause this I can
turn<00:04:29.130> linear<00:04:29.580> motion<00:04:30.090> or<00:04:30.570> into<00:04:31.259> rotary<00:04:31.590> motion

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
turn linear motion or into rotary motion

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.920 
turn linear motion or into rotary motion
so<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.789> back-and-forth<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:33.659> linear

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
so the back-and-forth is the linear

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.270 
so the back-and-forth is the linear
motion<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.289> can<00:04:34.440> turn<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.770> into<00:04:34.830> rotary

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
motion I can turn that into rotary

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.340 
motion I can turn that into rotary
motion<00:04:35.669> which<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.210> came

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.410
