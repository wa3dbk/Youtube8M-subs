colors together a compliment each other

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.670 
colors together a compliment each other
like<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.380> don't<00:05:56.220> know<00:05:56.370> like<00:05:57.350> they<00:05:58.350> should<00:05:58.560> go

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
like I don't know like they should go

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.540 
like I don't know like they should go
together<00:05:58.860> all<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.340> time

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.320 

so<00:06:02.210> basically<00:06:03.050> yeah<00:06:03.440> that's<00:06:03.800> all<00:06:04.100> my<00:06:04.790> top<00:06:05.060> 10
