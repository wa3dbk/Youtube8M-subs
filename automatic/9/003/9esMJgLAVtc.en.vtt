time<00:03:02.880> getting<00:03:03.240> headshots<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.810> pretty<00:03:04.140> much

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
time getting headshots and pretty much

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.960 
time getting headshots and pretty much
at<00:03:04.440> long<00:03:04.560> range<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.310> only<00:03:05.670> way<00:03:05.790> you're<00:03:05.880> going

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
at long range the only way you're going

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
at long range the only way you're going
to<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.210> kill<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.750> long<00:03:06.900> range<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.740> a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
to get a kill is it long range so is a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
to get a kill is it long range so is a
headshot<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:09.240> can<00:03:10.080> be<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.680> really

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
headshot which can be really really

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.270 
headshot which can be really really
frustrating<00:03:12.470> there<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.560> other<00:03:13.800> bolts<00:03:14.190> I

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
frustrating there is other bolts I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.110 
frustrating there is other bolts I
haven't<00:03:14.520> unlocked<00:03:14.730> them<00:03:14.970> yet<00:03:15.150> such<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.960> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
haven't unlocked them yet such as the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.180 
haven't unlocked them yet such as the
Haji<00:03:18.120> fault<00:03:18.720> which<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> high<00:03:19.590> explosive<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
Haji fault which is a high explosive I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.560 
Haji fault which is a high explosive I
guess<00:03:20.520> which<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.730> kind<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> grenade

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
guess which is kind of like a grenade

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.410 
guess which is kind of like a grenade
and<00:03:22.170> apparently<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.310> LOB<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
and apparently the LOB on that is a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.570 
and apparently the LOB on that is a
quite<00:03:25.080> drastic<00:03:26.040> anyway<00:03:26.220> here's<00:03:26.340> here's<00:03:26.520> a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.670 
long-range shot and this is complete
luck<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.850> don't<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.959> problem<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
luck like I don't the problem with the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.949 
luck like I don't the problem with the
crossbow<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.459> can't<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.239> bolt<00:03:33.720> in

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
crossbow is you can't see the bolt in

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.930 
crossbow is you can't see the bolt in
the<00:03:34.140> air<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.100> real<00:03:35.370> trouble<00:03:35.730> seeing<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
the air I have a real trouble seeing the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.760 
the air I have a real trouble seeing the
bolt<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.300> air<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.630> I'm<00:03:37.080> playing<00:03:37.320> on<00:03:37.410> like

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
bolt in the air and I'm playing on like

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.220 
bolt in the air and I'm playing on like
high<00:03:38.040> settings<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.270> can't<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.959> bolt

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
high settings and I can't see that bolt

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.050 
high settings and I can't see that bolt
and<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.680> could<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.459> can<00:03:41.489> judge

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and if I could just see it I can judge

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.420 
and if I could just see it I can judge
the<00:03:42.360> drop<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.470> bolt<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.800> bit<00:03:43.980> more<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
the drop on the bolt a bit more and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.400 
the drop on the bolt a bit more and
probably<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:45.030> more<00:03:45.150> kills<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.660> think<00:03:46.290> they

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
probably get more kills I think they

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.280 
probably get more kills I think they
need<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.709> somehow<00:03:47.540> make<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.780> bolt<00:03:49.019> more

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
need to somehow make the bolt more

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.280 
need to somehow make the bolt more
obvious<00:03:49.739> when<00:03:49.769> it's<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.130> air<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:52.019> it's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
obvious when it's in the air so it's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.840 
obvious when it's in the air so it's
easier<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.950> kills<00:03:53.160> or<00:03:53.370> learn<00:03:53.580> how<00:03:53.790> to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
easier to get the kills or learn how to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.490 
easier to get the kills or learn how to
use<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.360> right<00:03:54.840> now<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.019> feel<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.320> I'm

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
use it because right now I feel like I'm

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.759 
use it because right now I feel like I'm
guessing<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.160> I'll<00:03:57.120> reiterate<00:03:57.570> close<00:03:58.500> range

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
