 by notifying how they can observe are 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.930
 shark mixes with dragon and good in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.810
 overtake where everything starts and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.510
 Well, see you there 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.270
 and we are getting closer in places 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.120
 where are we going to start the slopes like 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.400
 we are already in the other part of the video and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.250
 good have to get to the shade base 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.710
 moon to this settlement that is by 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.589
 here and look for one in epc that is 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.160
 walking by reach is supposed to be 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.980
 a blood elf walked from here 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.420
 up there as you can see I've 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.339
 found 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.049
 good what you have to do is 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:09.310
 follow which gives you this in the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.700
 pc and see get to a point where they go to 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.640
 have the reputation to the fullest and will 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.159
 send a post here 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.440
 is going to reach a moment where arriving already 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.990
 the site will transform them into 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.630
 Orcs sounds like infiltrating a 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.640
 camp and if they have the reputation 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.210
 exalted they will be able to buy the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.940
 mounts 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 we are heading exactly towards that 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.540
 camp 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.940
 As you can see, I enter the area of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 camp and it has transformed me into a 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.530
 orc as you can see a red bow 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.300
 disgusting to go on top and I head in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
 site 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.800
 if I remember correctly the orc camp 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.850
 I was here 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.520
 if he was here well this is the site go 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.770
 where once they are done which 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.950
 is going to send and they have to search for the month 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.410
 of pc that they sell the mounts good 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.150
 in the pc we have it here they are going to deliver 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.910
 a mission with this I believe if I do not 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.490
 I mistake one of the last ones and it's going to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.060
 give the option to sell the six 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.510
 draco mounts to abyssal and good people 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
 from youtube this basically was all if 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.220
 I would have shown him how to do them 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.560
 it would be very long the video would be extended 20 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.740
 minutes half an hour so good I hope 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.730
