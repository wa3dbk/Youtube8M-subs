the<00:03:06.010> main<00:03:06.189> difference<00:03:06.579> again<00:03:06.849> is<00:03:06.879> it's<00:03:07.269> what

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
the main difference again is it's what

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.780 
the main difference again is it's what
I'm<00:03:07.510> paying<00:03:07.689> to<00:03:07.870> do<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.139> now<00:03:08.950> what<00:03:09.099> if<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.430> hung

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
I'm paying to do it now what if you hung

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.089 
I'm paying to do it now what if you hung
around<00:03:10.060> near<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> airport<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.650> pick<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:11.889> there

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
around near the airport to pick up there

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.800 
around near the airport to pick up there
no<00:03:12.639> you<00:03:12.849> have<00:03:12.939> to<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.090> special<00:03:13.450> permits<00:03:13.629> for

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
no you have to have special permits for

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.339 
no you have to have special permits for
the<00:03:13.900> airport

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
the airport

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.960

there<00:03:14.650> are<00:03:14.799> Oberer<00:03:15.159> drivers<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.639> are<00:03:15.730> able

there are Oberer drivers that are able
to<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.389> but<00:03:16.599> it's<00:03:16.930> there's<00:03:17.290> some<00:03:18.010> you

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
to do that but it's there's some you

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.289 
to do that but it's there's some you
gotta<00:03:18.340> jump<00:03:18.459> through<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.670> lot<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.879> groups<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.180> do

this<00:03:19.530> fix<00:03:20.530> fee<00:03:20.739> how<00:03:20.949> does<00:03:21.069> it<00:03:21.160> work<00:03:21.340> no<00:03:21.669> it's

this fix fee how does it work no it's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.659 
this fix fee how does it work no it's
it's<00:03:22.480> based<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.930> mileage<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.590> time<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:24.579> like

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
it's based on mileage and time just like

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.729 
it's based on mileage and time just like
on<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.849> taxi<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.840> runs<00:03:26.109> through<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.379> app<00:03:26.530> I

on a taxi it runs through the app I

on a taxi it runs through the app I
don't<00:03:26.799> even<00:03:26.980> know<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.609> attack<00:03:27.849> this<00:03:28.030> that's

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
don't even know I can attack this that's

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.449 
don't even know I can attack this that's
one<00:03:28.419> of<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.440> drawbacks<00:03:29.650> as<00:03:30.250> far

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
one of the one of the drawbacks as far

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.680 
one of the one of the drawbacks as far
as<00:03:30.519> I'm<00:03:30.669> concerned<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.359> don't<00:03:31.419> have<00:03:31.629> a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
as I'm concerned is that I don't have a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.449 
as I'm concerned is that I don't have a
meter<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.109> show<00:03:32.169> during<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> trip<00:03:33.010> how<00:03:33.280> much

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
meter to show during the trip how much

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.050 
meter to show during the trip how much
it's<00:03:33.639> going

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
it's going

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.550 
it's going
we<00:03:34.419> never<00:03:34.569> know<00:03:34.750> until<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.079> end<00:03:35.199> of<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.349> trip

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
we never know until the end of the trip

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.259 
we never know until the end of the trip
the<00:03:36.159> customer<00:03:36.519> doesn't<00:03:36.699> know<00:03:36.849> either

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
the customer doesn't know either

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.449 
the customer doesn't know either
yeah<00:03:37.629> they<00:03:38.079> find<00:03:38.319> out<00:03:38.470> when<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.769> comes<00:03:39.159> up<00:03:39.370> in

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
yeah they find out when it comes up in

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.009 
yeah they find out when it comes up in
their<00:03:39.549> app<00:03:39.639> once<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:39.970> clear<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.419> trip<00:03:40.629> on<00:03:40.750> here

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
their app once I clear the trip on here

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.599 
their app once I clear the trip on here
shows<00:03:41.319> how<00:03:41.349> much<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:41.859> and<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.190> shows<00:03:42.370> them

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
shows how much it is and it shows them

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.000 
shows how much it is and it shows them
on<00:03:42.730> their<00:03:42.849> device<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.840> let's<00:03:44.409> say<00:03:44.590> we're<00:03:44.859> in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
on their device so let's say we're in

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.800 
on their device so let's say we're in
ball<00:03:45.310> park<00:03:45.579> now<00:03:45.729> and<00:03:45.909> you<00:03:45.970> were<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.180> take<00:03:46.329> me<00:03:46.510> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
ball park now and you were to take me to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.050 
ball park now and you were to take me to
the<00:03:46.900> airport<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.400> charge<00:03:48.579> me<00:03:48.819> is<00:03:48.940> it

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
the airport do you charge me is it

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.509 
the airport do you charge me is it
charging<00:03:49.449> me<00:03:49.510> by<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.810> mile<00:03:50.169> yes<00:03:50.650> right<00:03:51.220> I'm

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
charging me by the mile yes right I'm

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.939 
charging me by the mile yes right I'm
also<00:03:51.790> time<00:03:52.659> if<00:03:52.840> we're<00:03:52.959> in<00:03:53.049> traffic<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.889> know

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
also time if we're in traffic you know

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.559 
also time if we're in traffic you know
we're<00:03:54.099> going<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> red<00:03:55.060> light<00:03:55.090> or<00:03:55.299> for

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
we're going like a red light or for

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.809 
we're going like a red light or for
stopped<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.079> goes<00:03:56.229> in<00:03:56.379> time<00:03:56.680> if<00:03:57.340> we're<00:03:57.519> movie

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
stopped it goes in time if we're movie

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.640 
stopped it goes in time if we're movie
he<00:03:58.000> goes<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.359> mileage<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:58.989> how<00:03:59.260> much<00:03:59.409> is<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
he goes on the mileage so how much is it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.270 
he goes on the mileage so how much is it
per<00:03:59.680> mile

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
per mile

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.149 
per mile
I<00:04:00.389> think<00:04:01.389> it's<00:04:01.540> dollar<00:04:02.019> 95<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.470> mile<00:04:02.680> right<00:04:02.979> now

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
I think it's dollar 95 a mile right now

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.259 
I think it's dollar 95 a mile right now
and<00:04:03.519> then<00:04:03.729> if<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.590> slow<00:04:05.590> down<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.729> don't<00:04:06.879> stop

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
and then if we slow down but don't stop

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.360 
and then if we slow down but don't stop
is<00:04:07.659> that<00:04:07.810> an<00:04:07.930> additional<00:04:08.290> charge<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:09.069> just

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
is that an additional charge it just

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.399 
is that an additional charge it just
depends<00:04:09.729> the<00:04:10.150> computer<00:04:10.569> figures<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.019> out<00:04:11.139> as

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
depends the computer figures it out as

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.430 
depends the computer figures it out as
to<00:04:11.859> which<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.250> more<00:04:12.940> lucrative<00:04:13.150> basically<00:04:13.870> so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
to which is more lucrative basically so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.219 
to which is more lucrative basically so
if<00:04:14.680> I'm<00:04:14.979> coming<00:04:15.099> really<00:04:15.459> slow<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.229> mileage

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
if I'm coming really slow the mileage

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.870 
if I'm coming really slow the mileage
might<00:04:17.440> not<00:04:17.590> be<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> good<00:04:18.010> thing<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.519> goes

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
might not be a good thing so it goes

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.069 
might not be a good thing so it goes
over<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.180> time<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.449> think<00:04:19.659> it's<00:04:19.840> somewhere

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
over to time I think it's somewhere

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.200 
over to time I think it's somewhere
around<00:04:20.199> like<00:04:20.349> 11<00:04:20.739> miles<00:04:20.919> an<00:04:21.070> hour<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.549> that'll

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
around like 11 miles an hour so that'll

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.390 
around like 11 miles an hour so that'll
switch<00:04:22.479> over<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.720> time

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
switch over to time

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.830 
switch over to time
but<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.639> never<00:04:23.790> on<00:04:23.970> both<00:04:24.210> at<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.449> same<00:04:24.660> time

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
but it's never on both at the same time

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.310 
but it's never on both at the same time
what<00:04:25.169> Maddie<00:04:25.350> cost<00:04:25.620> me<00:04:26.540> probably<00:04:27.540> less<00:04:28.139> than

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
what Maddie cost me probably less than

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.900 
what Maddie cost me probably less than
ten<00:04:28.500> bucks<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.250> what<00:04:29.430> would<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.580> cost<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:29.850> a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
ten bucks and what would it cost in a

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.629
