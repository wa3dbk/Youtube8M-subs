but he's not in the best place at the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.190 
but he's not in the best place at the

and I as I said it's not a lot of tear
with<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:17.989> creeps<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.790> think<00:04:19.790> it's<00:04:19.910> from

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
with this creeps I think it's from

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.789 
with this creeps I think it's from
coming<00:04:20.299> from<00:04:20.390> his<00:04:20.540> back<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.080> explanation<00:04:21.709> I

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
coming from his back the explanation I

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.760 
coming from his back the explanation I
get<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.760> feels<00:04:23.020> some<00:04:24.020> neural<00:04:24.290> pine<00:04:24.530> down

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
get and it feels some neural pine down

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.590 
get and it feels some neural pine down
for<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.010> hamstring<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.640> will<00:04:25.820> just<00:04:26.360> trade

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
for the hamstring so I will just trade

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.060 
for the hamstring so I will just trade
him<00:04:26.690> during<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> week<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.350> touchwood<00:04:27.770> did<00:04:27.950> it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
