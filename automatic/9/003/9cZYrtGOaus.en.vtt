00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.410
 good 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.490
 be welcome to seniors on this occasion 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.610
 let's talk about how to adjust yesterday 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.910
 a backpack we hope you like it 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.940
 all backpacks have a system of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 tapes that we do not give out a priori 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.310
 too much attention 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.340
 all the tapes are not the same they are 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.000
 designed and manufactured to serve 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 a certain purpose in summary we can 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 say that there are three types of tapes in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.910
 the backpacks 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 one how can this be 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 the ribbons carry material 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.240
 two 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.350
 Of compression 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 how are you from here 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.210
 the adjustment tapes 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 let's see how each of them works 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 they 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 the material portal citations are 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.090
 thought and designed to unite by the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.570
 part of outside any kind of 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 specific material with the backpack in 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.330
 this time as you can see this is the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.320
 portable is the bottom part of the holder 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.050
 Perez 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.030
 we also see in the rubber doors 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.250
 crampons supports any other object 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.960
 what does 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.680
 whereupon the only mission of this 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.750
 tape is to carry material by the party 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.330
 outside of the backpack 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.840
 On the other hand we see also that there is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.840
 Some tapes 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.610
 on your sides here 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.280
 that are designed to compress for 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.190
 to carry the load of the backpack of 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.760
 a more compact and more homogeneous shape 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 with which we will take a lot 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 these appointments although you can also 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 take advantage to bring some kind of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.549
 material by pressure in this area of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.090
 side of the backpack what is 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.370
 thought for us 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.140
 compact we have adjusting the size of the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.629
 backpack with which we avoid that dance 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.180
 any type of material inside 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.360
 the backpack and we also avoid carrying 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.390
 the loading of a knee shape and by 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.750
 another part we have the adjustment tapes 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.060
 As can be the columbarium we have 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.430
 almost a very important aspect at the time 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.650
 to be able to carry with comfort and with 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.079
 security the backpack is that we 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.349
 we will use it to lift it 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.230
 of the soil with load of the appropriate form 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.540
 the normal and the usual thing is that what 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.319
 take directly from the shoulder 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.269
 this is a wrong way because all the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.950
 weight and all the strength we need 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.849
 exercise to be able to lift it off the ground 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.189
 up to our shoulder we exercise it on 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.409
 an area of the backpack for which no 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.760
 has been developing we have to 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.830
 use the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.100
 designed and designed for this 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.790
 with what this tape does hold 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.200
 all efforts we need and then 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.200
 supporting him with the 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.290
 we review lumbar adjustment belt 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.459
 top load tensioner 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.530
 Ingestion charge sensor 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.889
 adjustment strap height of 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.120
 palms 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.669
 intense upper chest these are the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.259
 inks that we should use to adjust 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.389
 correctly the backpack of our 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.389
 back once put and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.430
 we will start first 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.430
 adjusting the lumbar belt 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.660
 then we will continue adjusting the 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.630
 shoulder pads 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.300
 now it's your turn to adjust 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.060
 regulation of our back height 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.580
 to finish with the load settings 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:08.539
 both lower and higher 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.539
 and finally closing the chest tensioner 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.750
 good friends hope we have you 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.220
 this information was useful 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.260
 We are waiting for you in the next installment of 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.560
 the high videos until I always want 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.560
 much
