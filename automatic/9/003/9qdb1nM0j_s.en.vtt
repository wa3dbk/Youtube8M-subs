00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.580
 novice drivers with you auto company 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.140
 roll forward 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we look at how correctly 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.990
 regulate the flow of light near the headlights 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 car while driving in the afternoon a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 also in the dark all with you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.539
 Remember that the dimensions and dipped headlights 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 we turn on around the clock managing our 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.890
 a car on a long journey as a rule 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.980
 load the trunk with heavy objects 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 the back part goes down and the top 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 rises so the stream of light 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.700
 dipped headlights lose their usual 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.489
 mood and that means our task 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 but to apply the adjustment as a proofreader 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 if it is not, we will consider as 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 adjust the dipped headlights correctly 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
 as well as do not forget that during 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.129
 road accident 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 as well as collisions with obstacles 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.869
 dipped headlights 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.119
 may also lose the usual setting 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.960
 so with we have to turn to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 to specialists 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 either do it manually and if not 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.119
 special conditions so we set 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.229
 your car in front of the screen either 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.700
 fence and wall 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 turn on the dipped headlights and creating 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.869
 certain position we are with you 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 start adjusting the car should 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:43.530
 be not far from the screen on 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.200
 distance of 5 meters if in the car 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 there is a proofreader so we apply 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.479
 adjustment using the device if 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.320
 the car is not equipped with adjusting 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.350
 the collector means open the hood and 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.420
 adjustable with special screws 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:09.709
 we make adjustment on width 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 as well as the height here is very important 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.800
 create the required width distance 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.760
 indicated in the picture 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.110
 and take into account the correct adjustment 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.080
 by height 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.080
