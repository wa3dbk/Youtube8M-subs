structure in front of you you should

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
structure in front of you you should
take<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> few<00:01:33.060> minutes<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> write<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.960> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
take the few minutes to write it out for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
take the few minutes to write it out for
yourself<00:01:34.590> eventually<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.549> won't<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
yourself eventually you won't have to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
yourself eventually you won't have to
write<00:01:36.180> anything<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> ideas<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.619> become

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
write anything and the ideas will become

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640 
write anything and the ideas will become
internalized<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
internalized so now what we have is just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:50.390 
internalized so now what we have is just
ride<00:01:41.430> cymbal<00:01:41.790> pattern
