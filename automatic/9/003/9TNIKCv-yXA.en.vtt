00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.759

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.990
 previously posted only 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.669
 fortnightly 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 but since I have not received so much 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.570
 Such a thing per month I'm posting 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.769
 so since last month only one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 video per month 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.619
 In this video, I'll show everything. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.509
 what you receive during the month of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 October beginning with the books of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.489
 partnership with publisher new concept 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 I received the scandal book that portrays the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 secret relationship the two young people 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 iphan and amelia as the father of the very average 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 young people want to keep this 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
 relationship in secret until she 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
 complete 18 years in this area of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 technology 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.329
 a good part of their relationship is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 done in a virtual way 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.100
 then one day the average parent finishes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.859
 discovering her photos on the computer 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.519
 so on the same day it ends up being 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.890
 arrested and her father accuses her of being a 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.229
 perverted pursuer who was 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.910

 addictive then the book you do not have 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.040
 want to stop reading but at the same time 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.989
 time I'm hating the characters of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.540
 a way that I do not put off when the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.340
 libel disaster then I do not know how much 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.410
 Just the fact that you want to speak for the keys. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.200
 while lack of it is told by the web 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.120
 ended up influencing this but what I 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.010

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.019
 imminent disaster because it is enough 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.480
 interesting then the story told 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.640
 by other eyes with partner height 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.519

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650

 There's a ballerina, I do not know if you can see. 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.940
 because of the color of the paper 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.130

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.000
 book published by him 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.799
 I'm very curious to make the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720
 reading because I liked others too 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.610
 his books that link to the glass world 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.470
 I have not said anything that has a review in the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.090
 blog and the face of needing a dream 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.680
 who also has his drawing on the blog 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.420
 next week 's understanding of 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.010
 book launch in sÃ£o paulo 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.299
 intend to attend when 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.049
 the other thing thought of this way 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.910
 volume was my kindle he made a 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.760
 where the partner banks have a 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.650
 time the lucky head who still won 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.930
 I did not read anything on it, it looks like 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.430
 thing I read the instruction manual and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.900
 I think I was quite impressed with the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.150
 screen with a way of how really 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.289
 It seems like I'm reading something on paper. 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.470
 so I think it will not be long 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.630
 for it to yield technology from ebooks 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.320
