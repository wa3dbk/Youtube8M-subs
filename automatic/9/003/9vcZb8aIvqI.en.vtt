00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 hi now i will test my 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.199
 a new tonal framework firm magician recently 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 I dropped this store again and bought 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.960
 there is a tonal basis for the face and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.160
 body called phase and body 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 foundation shade c1 yak not 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.770
 stared at a long time when only 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 acquired so-so lipstick and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 I finally bought such a tonal 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 the base 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.160
 to see how I will test this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.160
 foundation tonal see further 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 start testing the tonal 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 foundation magician and this is the first basis for me 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.500
 which came from this firm and ours I 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.350
 its small amount to the rear 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.540
 side of the hand and take a special brush 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.270
 which is in my set in my 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.020
 specially for applying tonal bases 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 starting box 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.050
 the texture shows that it is water based 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.250
 lays down a thin layer and its practically 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.950
 imperceptibly that is, here it is now 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.130
 dry as it absorbs into the skin and its 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.760
 will not be visible at all on the texture 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.360
 something like wider moshiri who 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.270
 I used to be somewhere probably in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.810
 mid-2011 I enjoyed and 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.680
 Here on composition seems to me like 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.000
 exactly on 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.260
 wider moshiri how to hold it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.870
 will i don't know because i only have her 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.110
 recently bought and have not tried that 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.150
 have not applied 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.590
 somewhere in these i'm looking to use 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.590
 old its basis 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.610
 now you can say something much 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 became smoother 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.470
 it can be seen that of course she does not paint over 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.710
 such here are large skin irregularities like on 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.450
 different from japan she doesn't close but here 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.670
 redness 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.910
 some minor skin irregularities 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.910
 removes you can see that immediately 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.349
 foundation need a little bit 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.920
 so I put 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.500
 somewhere here so much money and that is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.810
 already covered completely the whole face behind 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.459
 left to cover not only the forehead and you can 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.129
 will consider the test finished now with 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.969
 using a concealer, I will close all my 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.969
 roughness of the skin 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.840
 you can see that a little bit of money gleams 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.800
 from the skin and of course I am worth a little bit 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.820
 to powder 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.570
 for this, I take my gurney powder 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.570
 terracotta there buster 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.129
 and a little bit to the teacher to remove this 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.560
 a little shine I wear it in a light layer 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.660
 almost imperceptibly from the tonal basis 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.329
 the magician began to glow from within 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.300
 therefore, powder needs quite a bit 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.600
 after face sculpting now i'm 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.870
 put on cheekbones on bronzer 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.270
 and the last thing left for me to do is 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.270
 put on the cheeks and blush 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:46.460
 she lips I put lipstick magician and I did 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.849
 on her review in the last video I 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.319
 I use almost every day and she 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.319
 I have already begun to fade 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.889
 a little more 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.539
 in this video can be considered complete 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.930

 tonal foundations from the company maco face and 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.460
