00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.950
 Yes Let's go infinite series also please try come to see the wind of it is the nature of this problem what next 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:14.090
 It looks like we want to find the sum of infinite series of 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:19.400
 The infinite series is also the nature when it comes to what you learn here 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.270
 I think what to say when I am writing I freely if converge on the co-huh and what fancy is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.340
 Let's see 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.770
 First of all there is an infinite series an and say that m 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.990
 Let's say it converges to alpha 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:41.500
 In addition the infinite teapot, that is if there is another another sequence bn 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:44.620
 Also it means that either of the sequence and it converges to the beta when it was carried out story to infinity 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:51.870
 Go infinite series converges to co 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 If you say that you can say these two things at some time and you converge 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 This ant a sequence at nothing to 20 times in 100 times that of the previous book bytes to t by 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560
 It's okay though 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.780
 t by 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.900
 Now of course not and say the number Re com referred to all the time or have become railway Tashi 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.790
 t by being 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 I mean that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.509
 I can say this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.490
 ok but if it converges t by steve city by 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.490
 And it gives also to key bar converge 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.929
 If you reach these two stresses if they converge together in these two series 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.920
 If it converges, this alpha and beta will be squeezed 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:38.729
 If it is pulled, it is a compound simultaneous with this which is alpha and beta minus the main house 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.010
 If you add 8 + d, the answer will be an addition. 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.660
 If you subtract, the answer will be subtract this time child 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.540
 It is good good prefecture This is how to calculate how to calculate It is this to divide in two and calculate 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.790
 Even if I do it too much, I think I should do it 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:02:00.190
 Anai Ya and sigma and yan I do think each if you know this property 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.030
 I'm thinking the wind to say or not you say If you think this of infinite series and this infinite teapot 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.830
 So think about this 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:12.080
 Approach as well to think about this and each one converges 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.220
 It is not that is the answer you want to find it once you Tashi and Chanko answer if you 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.030
 I'm taking an approach 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.370
 So this is also thinking about infinite series 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.310
 This number sequence is a geometric progression with 1 mochi and 1/2 coffee 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:35.210
 And is that thinking that continues to reach to that of the wind mentioned infinite number a 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 Well then, if you use the nature of infinite technology, you'll soon get used to a host mother enemy 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.670
 Ok Ya In this equation was one of the ne ne coffee 3 minutes I is 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.069
 is not it 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.370
 I guess I'm not sure about this ceremony Let's review again 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:52.420
 In the case of infinite geometric series 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:57.069
 When you think that the distant series continues infinitely 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.830
 This was met mathematics date and if that door first, or general steel sn is what will become hell 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.900
 Pass by 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.680
 Deeply enthusiasm and here this I will be expressed by Which do here Nde official of the sum of the other geometric progression 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.310
 I can't touch it , I think there are many people who have mastered for a while 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.590
 I will 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:18.390
 If you are worried about it, please re-evaluate the sum of the mathematical b mathematical ratio series again 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.819
 If you think of an infinite 9 difference, it is fine if you make this n of n an arrow infinite 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.109
 Drink this 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:27.069
 When we thought about today, what would it be like? 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.710
 That's why there is one more absolute value for coffee. 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.680
 Well let's not go rate though 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.510
 My salmon's position and at the time of the song 55-1. 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.680
 Is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.390
 This is the only corn that goes to zero 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.590
 In other words , if you get a value of 1-r minutes , you are using it 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:52.120
 Figs r minute and before the value is out of this position and Kutteyuu is this one 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.530
 The previous third is half the public expense and this position is 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.330
 This is one of the lords 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.830
 But when it comes out, here's the cat's infinitive series and I've made it clear again 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.190
 Please do not know why 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:13.130
 The person who can go is also this horse entering, that is , it has converged to a. 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:18.739
 If you think in exactly the same way as what will happen as well the second half of the public expense in the princes is the city of Tteyuu this sequence 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:25.370
 Since Now a city east his infinite geometric series of the Moon in the same kind of formula 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:27.180
 You can give a prescription with 1- coffee's prescription, that is, the land converges to 3/2 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.570
 It is fun when it is understood 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.240
 Since converge both the original metabolic syndrome has reached an arrow it 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.810
 It is long that it becomes 7/2 We study about the nature of infinite series here 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.130
 Was 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.250
 His hit people who were able to understand not please do not hesitate to ask a question if there is a point at which I can not understand 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.250
 Let's practice firm to find hints can be two-base hit of but
