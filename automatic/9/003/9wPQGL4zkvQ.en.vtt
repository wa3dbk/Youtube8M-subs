didn't really need anything in my
collection<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.880> second<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
collection and second of all I just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.039 
collection and second of all I just
wasn't<00:01:10.350> impressed<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.420> miss<00:01:12.420> Oni<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.750> target

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
wasn't impressed and miss Oni for target

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
wasn't impressed and miss Oni for target
was<00:01:13.170> definitely<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.590> expensive<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
was definitely more expensive but the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
was definitely more expensive but the
quality<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.869> better<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
quality was a little bit better this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
quality was a little bit better this
time<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.890> felt<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> quality<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
time I felt like the quality was more of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.070 
time I felt like the quality was more of
a<00:01:18.600> target<00:01:18.869> standard<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.720> fine

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a target standard and so that's fine

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
a target standard and so that's fine
just<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.799> whatever<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> use

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
just for like whatever you want to use

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.499 
just for like whatever you want to use
it<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.799> not

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
it for but I just really was not

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
it for but I just really was not
impressed<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.810> definitely<00:01:28.200> looked<00:01:28.500> nicer<00:01:28.890> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
impressed it definitely looked nicer in
