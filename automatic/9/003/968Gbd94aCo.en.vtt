quantities<00:02:57.030> quality<00:02:57.780> or<00:02:58.319> planting<00:02:59.130> yeah

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
quantities quality or planting yeah

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.590 
quantities quality or planting yeah
quantities<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.989> that's<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.560> is

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
quantities on I think that's what it is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.570 
quantities on I think that's what it is
like<00:03:03.600> eight<00:03:03.989> next<00:03:04.530> time<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.950> then<00:03:05.069> like<00:03:05.220> ten

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
like eight next time and then like ten

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.890 
like eight next time and then like ten
and<00:03:05.819> stuff<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.560> pretty<00:03:07.769> much<00:03:07.860> say<00:03:08.160> it

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
and stuff so that's pretty much say it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.530 
and stuff so that's pretty much say it
sees<00:03:09.900> anything<00:03:10.410> woman<00:03:10.920> no<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:12.120> pretty<00:03:12.360> long

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
sees anything woman no just pretty long

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.809 
sees anything woman no just pretty long
