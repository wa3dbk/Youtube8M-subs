have in the UK and my job pretty much

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420

these were children who were in year two

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
these were children who were in year two
so<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.920> hadn't<00:00:26.220> even<00:00:26.310> set<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:27.000> example<00:00:27.359> for

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
eight years old I had to give a

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.060 
eight years old I had to give a
prediction<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.290> those<00:01:04.440> children<00:01:04.979> were

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
prediction of where those children were

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.400

one<00:02:54.250> school<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:54.580> worked<00:02:54.909> at<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.239> particular<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
one school I worked at in particular and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.190 
one school I worked at in particular and
it<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.379> in<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.830> very<00:02:57.430> low<00:02:57.730> socio-economic<00:02:58.360> area

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
it was in a very low socio-economic area

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.640 
it was in a very low socio-economic area
and<00:02:59.519> sometimes<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.700> felt<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.260> did<00:03:02.440> what<00:03:02.620> we

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and sometimes I felt we just did what we

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.080 
and sometimes I felt we just did what we
could<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> get<00:03:03.310> through<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.730> day<00:03:03.909> especially

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
could to get through the day especially

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.140 
could to get through the day especially
with<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:04.840> many<00:03:04.989> children<00:03:05.319> in<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> class<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.310> I

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
with so many children in the class and I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.470 
with so many children in the class and I
think<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.840> help<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.560> community<00:03:09.069> like<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.480> it
