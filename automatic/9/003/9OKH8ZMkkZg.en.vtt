hi<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.199> Gino<00:00:49.590> vanish<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.239> today<00:00:51.239> we're

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hi there I'm Gino vanish and today we're

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.259 
hi there I'm Gino vanish and today we're
going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.840> introduce<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.920> leverage<00:00:53.699> testing

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
going to introduce this leverage testing

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.670 
going to introduce this leverage testing
device<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.649> designed<00:00:55.969> specifically<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
device that is designed specifically for

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.259 
device that is designed specifically for
Complementary<00:00:58.680> diagnostic<00:00:59.550> endeavors<00:01:00.030> for

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
Complementary diagnostic endeavors for

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:17.600 
Complementary diagnostic endeavors for
treating<00:01:00.750> lameness<00:01:01.350> 'as<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> distal<00:01:02.460> limb

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630 

I<00:01:18.140> took<00:01:19.140> him<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.440> quite<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> few<00:01:19.800> vamps<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.550> they

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I took him to quite a few vamps and they

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
I took him to quite a few vamps and they
could<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.110> figure<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.740> wrong<00:01:22.770> with

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
could not figure out what was wrong with

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.630 
could not figure out what was wrong with
his<00:01:23.220> feet<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:24.120> came<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:25.110> either<00:01:25.640> gene

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
his feet it came down to either gene

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.180 
his feet it came down to either gene
helping<00:01:27.120> me<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:28.040> experimenting<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
helping me out and experimenting and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.040 
helping me out and experimenting and
doing<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> things<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.150> he's<00:01:30.480> done<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
doing all the things that he's done to

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.250 
doing all the things that he's done to
make<00:01:31.680> him<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.190> good<00:01:32.370> as<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.760> today<00:01:33.229> or<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
make him as good as he is today or I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.250 
make him as good as he is today or I
wouldn't<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.460> horse<00:01:35.760> basically<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.690> could

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
wouldn't have a horse basically I could

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.530 
wouldn't have a horse basically I could
tell<00:01:37.440> by<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.650> first<00:01:37.979> time<00:01:38.220> he<00:01:38.370> did<00:01:38.610> him<00:01:38.790> he

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
tell by the first time he did him he

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.830 
tell by the first time he did him he
actually<00:01:39.840> walked<00:01:40.440> off<00:01:40.950> without<00:01:41.400> being<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
actually walked off without being in the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.580 
actually walked off without being in the
so<00:01:43.200> total<00:01:43.710> distress<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.370> pain<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so total distress and pain but from this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
so total distress and pain but from this
time<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:48.030> kept<00:01:48.270> experimenting<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.170> gene

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
time on we kept experimenting and gene

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
time on we kept experimenting and gene
kept<00:01:49.560> experimenting<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.670> him<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:51.930> think

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
kept experimenting with him and I think

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.499 
kept experimenting with him and I think
the<00:01:52.290> final<00:01:52.560> thing<00:01:53.400> that's<00:01:53.550> helped<00:01:53.940> Archie<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the final thing that's helped Archie the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.499 
the final thing that's helped Archie the
most<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.470> leverage<00:01:55.890> test<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.490> us<00:01:56.670> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
most is the leverage test on us that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.530 
most is the leverage test on us that
they<00:01:57.869> did<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.500> make<00:01:58.710> his<00:01:59.190> foot<00:01:59.520> stay<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> guess<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
they did to make his foot stay I guess a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.540 
they did to make his foot stay I guess a
little<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:01.110> stable<00:02:01.350> we've<00:02:01.979> had<00:02:02.190> him<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
little more stable we've had him to so

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.100 
little more stable we've had him to so
many<00:02:02.670> vets<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.360> haven't<00:02:03.540> been<00:02:03.780> able<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
many vets and they haven't been able to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
many vets and they haven't been able to
quite<00:02:04.410> figure<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.040> what<00:02:05.759> would<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:06.960> him

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
quite figure out what would make him

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:21.250 
quite figure out what would make him
sound<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.640> he<00:02:08.790> would<00:02:08.970> ever<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.509> sound

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.550 

what<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.159> can<00:02:22.819> see<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.480> leverage<00:02:24.019> testing

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
what I can see from the leverage testing

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.309 
what I can see from the leverage testing
device<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.189> that<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.150> another<00:02:26.360> tool<00:02:26.689> that

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
device is that this is another tool that

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.100 
device is that this is another tool that
can<00:02:27.439> help<00:02:27.620> guide<00:02:27.980> us<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.930> especially<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.019> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
can help guide us in especially in a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.990 
can help guide us in especially in a
treatment<00:02:30.379> plan<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.189> somewhat<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.849> our

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
treatment plan and somewhat in our

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.479 
treatment plan and somewhat in our
diagnostic<00:02:32.720> workup<00:02:33.220> especially<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
diagnostic workup especially for the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.920 
diagnostic workup especially for the
case<00:02:34.700> where<00:02:34.939> we've<00:02:35.060> done<00:02:35.299> things<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:35.840> we

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
case where we've done things that we

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.509 
case where we've done things that we
think<00:02:36.170> should<00:02:36.409> work<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.890> they're<00:02:37.189> just<00:02:37.370> not

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
think should work and they're just not

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.490 
think should work and they're just not
working<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.720> can<00:02:38.959> give<00:02:39.110> us<00:02:39.140> some<00:02:39.349> new

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
working this can give us some new

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.809 
working this can give us some new
information<00:02:39.829> or<00:02:40.430> some<00:02:40.670> different

thinking and try and help us move

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.559 
thinking and try and help us move
forward<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.400> thing<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.790> seemed<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.359> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
forward the thing that seemed to be the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.020 
forward the thing that seemed to be the
most<00:02:47.870> rewarding<00:02:48.560> part<00:02:49.159> of<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.400> was<00:02:49.640> you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
most rewarding part of this was you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.460 
most rewarding part of this was you
asked<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.450> horse<00:02:50.659> what<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.260> truly

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
asked the horse what they really truly

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.349 
asked the horse what they really truly
feel<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.340> was<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> missing<00:02:52.909> link<00:02:53.120> with

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
feel and that was a missing link with

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.360 
feel and that was a missing link with
him<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.720> put<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.109> leverage<00:02:54.379> boot<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.799> him<00:02:54.950> he

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
him we put the leverage boot on him he

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.520 
him we put the leverage boot on him he
said<00:02:55.609> oh<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.599> this<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:57.049> all<00:02:57.290> and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
said oh I don't like this at all and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.860 
said oh I don't like this at all and
that<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.609> surprised<00:02:59.030> us<00:02:59.239> in<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.780> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that really surprised us in the and of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.330 
that really surprised us in the and of
course<00:03:00.049> horse<00:03:00.260> deterrence<00:03:00.680> circles<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:01.280> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
course horse deterrence circles that's a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.069 
course horse deterrence circles that's a
big<00:03:01.489> deal<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.359> thing<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.599> was<00:03:02.810> really

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
big deal but the thing that was really

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.330 
big deal but the thing that was really
impressive<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.889> wasn't<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.250> we

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
impressive about it wasn't so we

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.309 
impressive about it wasn't so we
switched<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:04.790> dial<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> other<00:03:05.510> side<00:03:05.840> and

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
switched the dial to the other side and

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.809 
switched the dial to the other side and
he<00:03:06.440> said<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.069> what's<00:03:07.280> going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.459> make<00:03:07.609> me

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
he said this is what's going to make me

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
he's maintained a soundness now for well

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.589 
he's maintained a soundness now for well
over<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.560> year<00:03:12.680> hasn't<00:03:13.129> it<00:03:13.370> haha<00:03:13.700> yeah<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.450> he's

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.309 

this<00:03:42.800> is<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.180> device<00:03:44.180> that's<00:03:44.510> strapped<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
this is a device that's strapped on the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.110 
this is a device that's strapped on the
bottom<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.770> horse's<00:03:46.160> foot<00:03:46.430> but<00:03:46.819> we<00:03:46.910> like<00:03:47.090> to

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
bottom of a horse's foot but we like to

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.690 
bottom of a horse's foot but we like to
have<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.599> centers<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.739> pivot<00:03:49.130> point<00:03:49.340> close

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
have this centers the pivot point close

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.760 
have this centers the pivot point close
to<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.060> center<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.510> articulation<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.470> dr.

to the center of articulation and dr.
trotters<00:03:52.160> going<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.550> show<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.819> a<00:03:53.180> little<00:03:53.569> bit

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
trotters going to show you a little bit

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.229 
trotters going to show you a little bit
about<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.099> minute<00:03:55.190> or<00:03:55.459> two<00:03:55.640> but

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
about that in just a minute or two but

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.940 
about that in just a minute or two but
the<00:03:56.420> straps<00:03:56.750> go<00:03:56.989> around<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> ankle<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the straps go around the ankle and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.880 
the straps go around the ankle and
surround<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.510> pastoring<00:04:00.080> area<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.739> then

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
surround the the pastoring area and then

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.979 
surround the the pastoring area and then
attach<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.580> backside<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.209> it's<00:04:02.360> basically

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
attach to the backside so it's basically

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.559 
attach to the backside so it's basically
strapped<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.620> there's<00:04:03.890> there's<00:04:04.580> once<00:04:05.390> it's

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
strapped on there's there's once it's

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.140 
strapped on there's there's once it's
held<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:05.900> place<00:04:06.170> this<00:04:06.980> dial<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.730> bottom

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
held in place this dial on the bottom

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.280 
held in place this dial on the bottom
can<00:04:08.660> be<00:04:08.900> moved<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.830> different<00:04:10.040> positions<00:04:10.790> on

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
can be moved to different positions on

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.530 
can be moved to different positions on
the<00:04:12.290> from<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:12.830> ground<00:04:13.100> surface<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.819> it

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
the from the ground surface and it

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.319 
the from the ground surface and it
elevates<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.290> foot<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.579> direction<00:04:17.120> and

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
elevates the foot in this direction and

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.890 
elevates the foot in this direction and
then<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:17.930> really<00:04:18.889> swing<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.310> around<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.750> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
then we really swing this around to the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.140 
then we really swing this around to the
opposite<00:04:21.350> position<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.979> get<00:04:22.639> a<00:04:22.700> counter

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
opposite position to get a counter

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.360 
opposite position to get a counter
reference<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.840> we<00:04:23.870> work<00:04:24.590> around<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.070> bottom

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
reference and we work around the bottom

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.260 
reference and we work around the bottom
of<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.520> foot<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.940> eight<00:04:26.090> different

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
of the foot in eight different

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.110 
of the foot in eight different
directions<00:04:27.160> diagonal<00:04:28.160> corners<00:04:28.610> front<00:04:29.000> to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
directions diagonal corners front to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.490 
directions diagonal corners front to
back<00:04:29.300> side<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.600> side<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:30.169> on<00:04:30.200> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
back side to side and then on the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.830 
back side to side and then on the
quadrants<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> quarter<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.360> section<00:04:32.690> of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
quadrants in the quarter of a section of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.400 
quadrants in the quarter of a section of
the<00:04:32.990> foot

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
the foot

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.740 
the foot
so<00:04:34.010> basically<00:04:34.460> we're<00:04:34.760> challenging<00:04:35.360> the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
so basically we're challenging the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.330 
so basically we're challenging the
structures<00:04:36.229> inside<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.070> foot<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
structures inside the foot the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.159 
structures inside the foot the
connective<00:04:37.760> tissue<00:04:38.030> for<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.360> most<00:04:38.630> part<00:04:38.900> and

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
connective tissue for the most part and

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.790 
connective tissue for the most part and
the<00:04:39.320> joint<00:04:39.590> itself<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.900> thing<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.350> seems

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
the joint itself the thing that seems

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.250 
the joint itself the thing that seems
missing<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.520> lot<00:04:43.669> of<00:04:43.750> treatment<00:04:44.750> protocols

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
missing in a lot of treatment protocols

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.960 
missing in a lot of treatment protocols
is<00:04:45.560> asking<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.280> horse<00:04:46.460> where<00:04:46.669> they<00:04:46.760> really

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
is asking the horse where they really

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.510 
is asking the horse where they really
hurt<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.330> most<00:04:48.080> importantly<00:04:48.770> not<00:04:49.460> just

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
hurt and most importantly not just

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.219 
hurt and most importantly not just
exactly<00:04:50.270> where<00:04:50.450> they<00:04:50.570> hurt<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:50.900> what<00:04:51.050> makes

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
exactly where they hurt but what makes

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.140 
exactly where they hurt but what makes
them<00:04:51.380> feel<00:04:51.590> good<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.460> if<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.760> can<00:04:52.880> make<00:04:53.000> them

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
them feel good and if you can make them

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.279 
them feel good and if you can make them
feel<00:04:53.419> good<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:54.669> give<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.030> them<00:04:56.289> 24/7

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
feel good and give that to them 24/7

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.340 
feel good and give that to them 24/7
they're<00:04:57.800> eventually<00:04:58.070> going<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.610> heal

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
they're eventually going to heal

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.250 
they're eventually going to heal
sensibly<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.750> very<00:05:02.960> interesting

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
sensibly it's a very interesting

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.040 
sensibly it's a very interesting
approach<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.430> think<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:05.840> lets

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
approach and I and I think it it lets

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.690 
approach and I and I think it it lets
them<00:05:06.200> be<00:05:06.260> a<00:05:06.410> more<00:05:06.620> active<00:05:06.950> participant<00:05:07.550> in

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
them be a more active participant in

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.100 
them be a more active participant in
what's<00:05:07.880> going<00:05:08.210> on<00:05:08.389> you<00:05:08.690> know<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:08.990> that's

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
what's going on you know and that's

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.890 
what's going on you know and that's
that's<00:05:09.979> not<00:05:10.190> always<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.150> case<00:05:11.180> with<00:05:11.570> some<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
that's not always the case with some of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:23.760 
that's not always the case with some of
the<00:05:11.990> decisions<00:05:12.440> we<00:05:12.590> make<00:05:12.770> for<00:05:13.039> them

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.570

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
so we had his knees injected his hocks

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.270 
so we had his knees injected his hocks
injected<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:29.349> know<00:05:29.470> he<00:05:29.590> would<00:05:29.800> go<00:05:29.979> from<00:05:30.190> one

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
injected you know he would go from one

been a night and day difference for sure
and<00:06:19.930> it's<00:06:20.229> funny<00:06:20.470> one<00:06:20.800> of<00:06:20.889> those<00:06:21.009> things<00:06:21.250> you

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
and it's funny one of those things you

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.649 
and it's funny one of those things you
know<00:06:21.430> these<00:06:21.520> horses<00:06:21.789> can't<00:06:22.060> talk<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.449> us<00:06:22.479> on

know these horses can't talk to us on

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.920 
know these horses can't talk to us on
Porsche<00:06:23.050> also<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:24.240> recollected<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.300> app<00:06:25.599> when

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
Porsche also I recollected that app when

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.330 
Porsche also I recollected that app when
we<00:06:26.050> first<00:06:26.319> saw<00:06:26.530> him<00:06:26.560> he<00:06:26.830> didn't<00:06:27.099> turn<00:06:27.190> around

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
we first saw him he didn't turn around

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.249 
we first saw him he didn't turn around
very<00:06:27.699> good<00:06:27.909> and<00:06:28.090> he<00:06:28.150> acted<00:06:28.659> like<00:06:28.690> we<00:06:28.900> were<00:06:28.930> LED

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
very good and he acted like we were LED

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.140 
very good and he acted like we were LED
shoes<00:06:29.620> and<00:06:30.099> he<00:06:30.219> wasn't<00:06:30.400> blame<00:06:30.669> at<00:06:30.820> all<00:06:30.940> at<00:06:31.060> that

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
shoes and he wasn't blame at all at that

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.909 
shoes and he wasn't blame at all at that
time<00:06:31.419> that<00:06:31.630> first<00:06:31.840> week<00:06:32.110> or<00:06:32.289> two<00:06:32.349> that<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.740> had

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
time that first week or two that I had

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.770 
time that first week or two that I had
him<00:06:33.099> but<00:06:33.610> he<00:06:33.699> just<00:06:33.940> did<00:06:34.210> not<00:06:34.389> want<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:34.659> turn

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
him but he just did not want to turn

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.629 
him but he just did not want to turn
around<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.530> so<00:06:35.680> that's<00:06:35.860> in<00:06:36.009> things<00:06:36.310> he<00:06:36.430> came

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
around it so that's in things he came

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.879 
around it so that's in things he came
back<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.479> me<00:06:37.719> me<00:06:37.780> a<00:06:37.900> crab<00:06:38.259> that<00:06:38.440> she<00:06:38.560> was<00:06:38.680> put<00:06:38.860> on

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
back to me me a crab that she was put on

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.700 
back to me me a crab that she was put on
a<00:06:39.610> hundred<00:06:40.180> percent<00:06:40.240> say<00:06:40.719> on<00:06:40.780> but<00:06:41.349> has<00:06:41.440> turned

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
a hundred percent say on but has turned

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.580 
a hundred percent say on but has turned
around<00:06:41.860> just<00:06:42.310> miraculously<00:06:42.969> got<00:06:43.180> better

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
around just miraculously got better

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.959 
around just miraculously got better
because<00:06:44.590> I<00:06:44.800> think<00:06:45.009> it's<00:06:45.250> good<00:06:45.370> for<00:06:45.400> felt<00:06:45.669> it<00:06:45.820> I

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
because I think it's good for felt it I

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.339 
because I think it's good for felt it I
think<00:06:46.180> he<00:06:46.300> was<00:06:46.419> a<00:06:46.449> little<00:06:46.599> sore<00:06:46.900> but<00:06:47.020> not<00:06:47.169> so

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
think he was a little sore but not so

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.200 
think he was a little sore but not so
sore<00:06:47.560> will<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:47.800> tell<00:06:48.039> my<00:06:48.460> first<00:06:48.759> start<00:06:49.000> of<00:06:49.090> me

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
sore will you tell my first start of me

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.540 
sore will you tell my first start of me
but<00:06:49.750> he<00:06:49.780> was<00:06:50.020> that<00:06:50.409> much<00:06:50.620> better<00:06:50.979> to<00:06:51.159> where<00:06:51.310> we

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
but he was that much better to where we

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.240 
but he was that much better to where we
turn<00:06:51.699> around<00:06:51.969> better<00:06:52.180> is<00:06:52.599> by<00:06:52.810> episode<00:06:53.259> so<00:06:54.159> his

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
turn around better is by episode so his

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:03.990 
turn around better is by episode so his
performance<00:06:54.699> improved

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.790 

and<00:07:05.000> I<00:07:05.090> think<00:07:05.300> the<00:07:05.389> missing<00:07:05.600> link<00:07:05.960> is<00:07:06.200> just<00:07:06.650> the

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
and I think the missing link is just the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.230 
and I think the missing link is just the
fact<00:07:07.040> that<00:07:07.160> we've<00:07:07.400> never<00:07:07.550> been<00:07:07.700> able<00:07:07.940> to<00:07:08.060> ask

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
fact that we've never been able to ask

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.810 
fact that we've never been able to ask
the<00:07:08.450> horse<00:07:08.570> in<00:07:08.840> a<00:07:08.930> way<00:07:09.050> that<00:07:09.230> we<00:07:09.350> can<00:07:09.650> now<00:07:09.919> and<00:07:10.760> I

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.610 
the horse in a way that we can now and I
think<00:07:10.880> it's<00:07:11.180> opening<00:07:11.600> new<00:07:11.780> ground<00:07:12.110> into<00:07:12.470> the

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
think it's opening new ground into the

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.379 
think it's opening new ground into the
treatment<00:07:12.919> protocol<00:07:13.610> but<00:07:13.880> without<00:07:14.150> the

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
treatment protocol but without the

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.290 
treatment protocol but without the
leverage<00:07:14.750> testing<00:07:15.260> tool<00:07:15.530> you<00:07:16.220> would<00:07:16.400> never<00:07:16.580> be

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
leverage testing tool you would never be

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.600 
leverage testing tool you would never be
able<00:07:17.419> to<00:07:17.660> get<00:07:18.050> an<00:07:18.320> appreciation<00:07:18.919> for<00:07:19.340> what's

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
able to get an appreciation for what's

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.850 
able to get an appreciation for what's
possible<00:07:19.720> and<00:07:20.720> I<00:07:20.810> think<00:07:20.840> we've<00:07:21.200> just<00:07:21.470> begun<00:07:21.650> to

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
possible and I think we've just begun to

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:51.439 
possible and I think we've just begun to
scratch<00:07:22.190> the<00:07:22.400> surface<00:07:22.639> on<00:07:23.389> what's<00:07:23.750> possible
