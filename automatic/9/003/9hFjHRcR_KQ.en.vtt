on the roof and the church built well I
don't<00:00:49.379> even<00:00:49.469> know<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> church<00:00:50.719> but

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
don't even know if it's a church but

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
don't even know if it's a church but

yes you can get on the roof the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.900 
yes you can get on the roof the
interesting<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.340> haven't<00:00:59.640> seen

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
interesting thing is that I haven't seen

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
interesting thing is that I haven't seen
anyone<00:01:00.359> else<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.039> doesn't

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
anyone else get on it and it doesn't

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
anyone else get on it and it doesn't
appear<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> glitch<00:01:03.920> because<00:01:04.920> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
appear to be a glitch because it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
appear to be a glitch because it's
fairly<00:01:05.820> simple<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.600> straightforward<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.439> get

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
fairly simple and straightforward to get

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.520 
fairly simple and straightforward to get
up<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:10.549> alright<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.760> let<00:01:11.939> us<00:01:11.970> begin<00:01:12.530> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
up there alright so let us begin it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
up there alright so let us begin it's
pretty<00:01:13.890> simple<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.240> top<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.509> these

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pretty simple just get on top of these

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.260 
pretty simple just get on top of these
two<00:01:15.810> barrels<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.430> climb<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
two barrels and then climb on top of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.460 
two barrels and then climb on top of
that<00:01:18.479> door<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.750> there

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that door right there

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
that door right there
I've<00:01:19.830> seen<00:01:20.130> people<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.549> top<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> store

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
I've seen people on top of this store

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
I've seen people on top of this store
but<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.720> guess<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.049> never<00:01:22.320> occurred<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
but I guess it just never occurred to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
but I guess it just never occurred to
them<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> jump<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> next<00:01:24.150> part<00:01:24.390> which

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
them to jump on to the next part which

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.109 
them to jump on to the next part which
is<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> wall<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.820> just<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:26.970> sure

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
is the wall right here just make sure

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
is the wall right here just make sure
you<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.810> jump<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.290> fall<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you don't over jump or fall into it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
you don't over jump or fall into it
because<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.820> trapped<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.810> will

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
because you will be trapped you will

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
because you will be trapped you will
have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> either<00:01:31.439> blow<00:01:32.430> yourself<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.060> or<00:01:33.299> quits

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
have to either blow yourself up or quits

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.890 
have to either blow yourself up or quits
and<00:01:34.140> exit<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> game<00:01:35.000> or<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.840> able

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and exit the game or you would be able

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300 
and exit the game or you would be able
to<00:01:37.079> wait<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> guess<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.770> next<00:01:37.799> round<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to wait I guess for the next round to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.210 
to wait I guess for the next round to
start<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.530> follow<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:41.009> once

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
start but just don't follow there once

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.200
