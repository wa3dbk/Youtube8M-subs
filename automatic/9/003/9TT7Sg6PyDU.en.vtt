00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:10.080
 Good day , I wish you 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.340
 show breeding option 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 Californian worm I showed already 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.539
 one video here is a link to it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.279
 how it all began here would like you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.910
 show again pay attention here 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.679
 abandoned basement and 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:38.030
 it all starts with a small handful 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:43.309
 organics see it what's the situation 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:48.899
 literally a month has already happened here 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:56.399
 Here we take such organic matter 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:01.050
 everything goes clean from the kitchen and we are now 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.590
 let's see what we have in the end here 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590
 look 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 because the light music plays 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.010
 that's where we won't take 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.740
 so then we see 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:23.600
 they run away from the light on their discover 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:28.760
 here look this in just one month 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.850
 and I had several such there 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:38.450
 comments from a mess in the basement 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:43.730
 mouse and there all sorts of rats and so on and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:49.910
 so now see the situation 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.580
 here is winter we have winter and that's how we are 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 think fishermen will react to that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:02.510
 on such a worm how much can you take 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:07.010
 apiece for such worms you look 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.190
 how much of this worm is there 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.030
 make sense to literally meter there 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:18.470
 square them in the basement and start this 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 business business starts almost from 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.709
 zero here's a classic example 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.489
 see it from above yet did it yet 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.060
 before nila and she is not yet before her he 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.739
 quickly 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.070
 but that's where we dig you see vodka 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:46.430
 how many of them there is one such 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:48.250
 see a little thing so here draw conclusions 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.140
 make your own conclusions 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.410
 sorry for the quality of the shooting because 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.620
 rented on a smartphone but i think the point is you 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.750
 understood I highlighted a little here 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.350
 lamps on 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.090
 think about the main thing that you 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.930
 for you to see for yourself 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.310
 the most result here for a month time 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.310
 how many worm is here 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:25.720
 can be seen and then it will work out 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:27.850
 vermicompost and as a result we will have and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.500
 worm and biohumus and processing 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.780
 organic waste all the success 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.020
 subscribe to my channel see you soon 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.020
 meeting
