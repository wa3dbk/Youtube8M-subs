00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
another one that I would recommend is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.460

with the task killer that's built in to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.960 
with the task killer that's built in to
the<00:03:21.360> galaxy<00:03:21.750> s3<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.920> there's<00:03:23.130> some<00:03:23.370> good<00:03:23.910> ones

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the galaxy s3 so there's some good ones

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.200 
the galaxy s3 so there's some good ones
I<00:03:24.300> would<00:03:24.360> recommend<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:26.030> while<00:03:27.030> you're

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
here and now normally you would just

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.220 
here and now normally you would just
install<00:03:31.110> Polaris<00:03:31.500> Office<00:03:31.710> I<00:03:32.100> don't<00:03:32.490> think
