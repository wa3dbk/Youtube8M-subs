that's<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.360> only<00:03:15.390> thing<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.230> was<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:16.470> like

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that's the only thing so I was just like

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.400 
that's the only thing so I was just like
well<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> better<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.520> nuke<00:03:17.760> because<00:03:18.410> that's

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
well I better get a nuke because that's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.680 
well I better get a nuke because that's
what<00:03:19.500> people<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.220> see<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.000> guess<00:03:21.270> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
what people like to see that I guess a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.020 
what people like to see that I guess a
lot<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> people<00:03:22.500> take<00:03:22.980> notes<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.550> something

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
lot of people take notes as something

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.380 
lot of people take notes as something
that<00:03:24.060> dumb<00:03:25.040> proves<00:03:26.040> you're<00:03:26.459> good<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.180> can

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
that dumb proves you're good if you can

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.160 
that dumb proves you're good if you can
record<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.870> nuke<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:29.459> legit<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.270> there's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
record a nuke and it's legit and there's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.870 
record a nuke and it's legit and there's
nothing<00:03:31.320> cheap<00:03:31.739> about<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.280> your<00:03:32.459> sniping

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
nothing cheap about it like your sniping

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.870 
nothing cheap about it like your sniping
or<00:03:33.030> something<00:03:33.420> now<00:03:33.540> grenade<00:03:33.930> launching<00:03:34.410> that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
or something now grenade launching that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.760 
or something now grenade launching that
that's<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.720> considered<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> good<00:03:37.500> player

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
that's can you considered a good player

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.150 
that's can you considered a good player
so<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.940> went<00:03:39.780> far<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.440> go<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.920> could<00:03:41.100> probably

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
so I went far as I go I could probably

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.860 
so I went far as I go I could probably
it<00:03:41.400> an<00:03:41.520> Oakland<00:03:41.880> just<00:03:42.300> record<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> little

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it an Oakland just record a little

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
maybe I can get a phone loop because I

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.910 
maybe I can get a phone loop because I
actually<00:03:53.010> never<00:03:53.310> did<00:03:53.610> get<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.820> phony<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.769> got

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
that killed 10 people and one life thing

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.259 
that killed 10 people and one life thing
because<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.620> prestiged<00:03:59.130> think<00:03:59.940> I'm<00:04:00.030> level

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
because I just prestiged think I'm level

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.660 
because I just prestiged think I'm level
30<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.080> takes<00:04:01.260> me<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.530> five<00:04:01.830> matches<00:04:02.459> to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
30 and it takes me like five matches to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.910 
30 and it takes me like five matches to
get<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.910> level<00:04:03.030> 30<00:04:03.330> well<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.050> five<00:04:04.350> that's<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
get to level 30 well not five that's a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.590 
get to level 30 well not five that's a
little<00:04:05.100> bit<00:04:05.310> too<00:04:05.790> much<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.150> takes<00:04:06.269> me<00:04:06.480> probably

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
little bit too much it takes me probably

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.290 
little bit too much it takes me probably
like<00:04:06.959> 20<00:04:07.530> matches<00:04:07.860> they<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.519> say<00:04:08.730> maybe<00:04:09.060> not

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320

computer<00:06:32.470> so<00:06:33.220> I<00:06:33.690> like<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.720> listen<00:06:35.380> to

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
computer so I like to listen to

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.480 
computer so I like to listen to
so<00:06:37.539> I<00:06:37.590> wasn't<00:06:38.590> recording<00:06:39.330> but<00:06:40.330> dumb<00:06:40.569> I<00:06:41.490> think

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
so I wasn't recording but dumb I think

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.439 
so I wasn't recording but dumb I think
getting<00:06:43.240> a<00:06:43.389> nuke<00:06:43.569> fail<00:06:46.560> um<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:48.009> think<00:06:48.699> getting<00:06:49.300> a

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
getting a nuke fail um I think getting a

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.390 
getting a nuke fail um I think getting a
nuke<00:06:49.660> isn't<00:06:50.020> born<00:06:50.229> in<00:06:50.380> all<00:06:50.530> that's<00:06:50.889> all<00:06:51.099> cool

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
nuke isn't born in all that's all cool

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.360 
nuke isn't born in all that's all cool
inches<00:06:52.000> and<00:06:52.330> but<00:06:53.199> getting<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.710> nuke<00:06:53.860> fails<00:06:54.190> a

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
inches and but getting a nuke fails a

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.710 
inches and but getting a nuke fails a
little<00:06:54.669> more<00:06:54.789> entertaining<00:06:55.180> for<00:06:55.389> people<00:06:55.660> to

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
little more entertaining for people to

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.170 
little more entertaining for people to
watch<00:06:55.930> because<00:06:56.410> it<00:06:56.949> happens<00:06:57.490> more<00:06:57.610> rare<00:06:58.150> than

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
watch because it happens more rare than

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.140 
watch because it happens more rare than
people<00:06:58.870> getting<00:06:59.110> the<00:06:59.229> nuke<00:06:59.520> getting<00:07:00.520> 24<00:07:00.880> kills

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
people getting the nuke getting 24 kills

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.420 
people getting the nuke getting 24 kills
and<00:07:01.300> dying<00:07:01.479> is<00:07:01.810> much<00:07:02.319> more<00:07:02.500> rare<00:07:02.770> than<00:07:02.800> getting

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
and dying is much more rare than getting

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.650 
and dying is much more rare than getting
25<00:07:04.389> kills<00:07:05.400> simply<00:07:06.400> put<00:07:06.639> with<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:06.940> new<00:07:07.240> gun<00:07:07.419> you

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
25 kills simply put with the new gun you

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.689 
25 kills simply put with the new gun you
have<00:07:07.750> to<00:07:07.870> have<00:07:07.990> new<00:07:08.229> go<00:07:08.380> to<00:07:08.560> so<00:07:09.130> there<00:07:09.550> you<00:07:09.580> go
