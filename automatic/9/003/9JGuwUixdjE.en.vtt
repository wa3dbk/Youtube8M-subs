00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 every second sold nissan is one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.930
 qashqai 2007 had the class of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 kompakt suv is virtually co-founded in 2010 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.400
 There was an extensive facelift and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 now everything is new the technology economical 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.769
 motors the interior the complete 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.599
 design 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.369
 if he can still keep that what 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.369
 old qashqai could test it today 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.039
 a backyard of the new qashqai has 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 nissan clearly on athleticism 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 put those pointed to the middle 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 tapered rear lights and yet 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 give a big big tear-off edge up here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 a new independence of the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 old qashqai did not have to however 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.170
 This plastic rear skirt tarnishes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.329
 bit the high-quality design behind 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 the sporty design is here 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.500
 the side away to the back 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.629
 sloping roofline acts coupÃ©haft and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.680
 thus underlines the sportiness 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.449
 but unfortunately, this is also 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 unsightly plastic thing ford in the form of a 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.780
 side skirts one could say that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 he seems a bit more off-roader to me 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 Personally, it just does not like it either 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.090
 the front presents itself dynamically 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.890
 through the many edges almost 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 aggressive in the middle together 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.460
 and most modern on what I already at 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 missed some svs in this class 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.869
 I have a modern light up concept 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.869
 and he even has LED headlights 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 yes quite as athletic as he looks 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.450
 I do not drive that but that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 was not the intention of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.969
 nissan engineers 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.610
 because it happens to a family car 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.600
 or if you like a suv and the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.979
 does not have to be athletic he go 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.079
 drives comfortably the drives itself 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.700
 pleasant but rather bank quite strong 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.229
 If you do not want that, you have to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 Buy sports cars that can do it too 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.439
 I'm just saying they're doing too 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.439
 fun 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.590
 the 1.6 liter diesel engine here in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.319
 our test car is really positive 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.429
 He is absolutely thrifty on turning 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.989
 we are here in town right now 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.700
 on the way with 6 1 liter 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.670
 Average consumption was absolutely in 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 order is and the power of 130 ps 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.900
 enough for city traffic and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.459
 overland traffic absolutely out of the only 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.260
 highway teismann not really 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.910
 lively or fast where we are 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.950
 synonymous with the problem because this is here 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.640
 is the current top motorization and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.299
 They are 130 hp in this vehicle class 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.299
 has a little bit 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.620
 the interior has nissan 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.690
 really hard given in comparison 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.190
 to the predecessor all materials are much 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.820
 high quality one feels almost like in the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.890
 vw golf 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.360
 right here this leather substitute is indeed 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.940
 made of plastic but really feels 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.370
 valued to the multimedia unit with the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.660
 Built-in navi function makes mistakes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
 I find no super service 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.310
 Negative point to a particularly good 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.890
 I like that in the instrument cluster 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.300
 built-in full color display 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.120
 But what absolutely negative in the eye 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.130
 it 's so obvious 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.050
 cheap plastic that here in the steering wheel 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.340
 it reminds him of a game 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.860
 controller for the playstation 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.080
 The fund also offers tall people 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.480
 pass from nissan pure place 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 qashqai +2 with seven sitting there 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.230
 no longer this role takes over from the end 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.330
 the year of the x-trail the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.610
 trunk lid opens 15 centimeters 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.380
 higher and the loading floor is now too 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.670
 variably used as a space trainer 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.260
 have the top motorization with 130 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.960
 this verse and 320 newton meters 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.670
 torque sprinter the 10 5 seconds 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.860
 from 0 to 100 and reaches one 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.930
 top speed of 190 kilometers 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.400
 per hour 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.180
 Let's summarize the motors together 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.040
 are more economical 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.750
 The interior is significantly upgraded 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.730
 and the design is bolder and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 sportier the whole for a bit 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.880
 less coal than the predecessor thus 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.230
 I would say is the success of 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.230
 qashqai absolutely nothing in the way
