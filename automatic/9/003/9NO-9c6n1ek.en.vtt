00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 because consumers have a rash 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 a lot of information sometimes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.970
 it can be hard to tell the truth from 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 advertising slogan 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.369
 Internet TV specialized 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.900
 the press makes us consumers 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.700
 make one choice or another 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 to avoid all sorts of beer currents we 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 decided to get first-hand information 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.879
 for this very purpose we came under 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 St. Petersburg City Siosk where 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 there is a factory 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 nokian tires and unsurprisingly finnish 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.760
 the manufacturer is constantly improving 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.469
 creates its products tires 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 better suited to harsh 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 national winners guaranteed hit 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 this winter new nokian hakkapeliitta 8 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 the true leader among studded tires 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 possessing a number of unique 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.920
 technical solutions are not available for 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 most competitors as a result 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 hakkapeliitta 8 has excellent 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 clutch on ice and snow 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 perfectly behaves in extreme 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 different acoustic situations 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.640
 comfort rotates easily 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 saves fuel and reduces impact 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.490
 on the roadbed but about everything 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 let's begin acquaintance by bus from the office 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.500
 nokian companies 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.360
 if we talk about winter studded tires 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 and nokian solutions in particular 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.080
 hakkapeliitta 8 which she is here 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.180
 presented now 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.400
 studded tire strength is 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 high predictability in management 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.260
 ability to exercise safe 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.540
 grip on most road types 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.280
 cover in winter that is how can 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.180
 to be and as clean asphalt and to at the same 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 some time 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.979
 having gotten a crust of ice 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.660
 surfaces here on all these types 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.970
 nokian hakkapeliitta 8 tire surface 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.710
 provides its immaculate 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 grip allow the driver to feel 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.000
 self confidently then can be attributed 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.369
 weak sides not because the tire 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 bad because to be safe from 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.679
 some unnecessary myths of the owners but 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 if one refers to the areas 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.600
 the limitations of studded tires 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.810
 This can be distinguished as noise from 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.330
 operation studded tires noise 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.959
 inevitably another thing arises like a tire 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 cope with this noise in the nokian bus 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.860
 hakkapeliitta 8 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.989
 to fight noise too, there are certain 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.820
 technical innovations that allow 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.370
 reduce this noise level and yet 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.230
 he is and it can be attributed to some 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.080
 limiting factor in the case 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 if our customer is with you 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 who uses these tires he 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.890
 sensitive to this parameter 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 details about the features of the building 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 tires and technologies used in it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.590
 as always with our specialist 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.799
 new model nokian hakkapeliitta 8 what 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.950
 they can say this is the eighth generation 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.659
 winter tires nokian hackapelite 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.690
 in its features a new rubber compound 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.180
 mixes new tread design new thorn 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.180
 and many new other technologies 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.190
 applied in this particular bus start with 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.440
 announced new studing concept 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.079
 shindin them surely this is one of the most 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.170
 probably important moments thanks 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.670
 computer simulation 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 optimized spikes location on 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.579
 tread area in such a way that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.829
 one spike does not overlap the trajectory 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.319
 other that is spikes evenly 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.909
 located across the surface 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.720
 particular importance all manufacturers 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.590
 pay exactly in the production of winter tires 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.409
 rubber compound 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.989
 This tire uses a brand new one. 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.659
 a rubber mixture based on it and Kreusa 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.359
 second generation natural rubber and 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.030
 adding rapeseed oil due to this 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.000
 the specialists of the company I let nokina succeed 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.400
 achieve the widest working 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.379
 temperature range 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.569
 down to the lowest extreme 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.849
 low temperature conditions and due to 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.139
 what else is provided higher 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.049
 road grip 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.220
 Well, in this bus, besides the fact that we already 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.799
 said applied 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.780
 some more new technology special 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.690
 I would like to pay attention to it 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.060
 lamella structure due to the hard 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.190
 gearing new 3d slat tire 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.560
 provides high coupling 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.970
 characteristics as with longitudinal and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.330
 with lateral loads 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.289
 and what does the specified winter mean 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.180
 wear indicator 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.039
 here it is about what the magnitude 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.289
 residual tread pattern winter 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.810
 tires more than summer equals 4 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.070
 millimeter and special indicators 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.770
 wear that this model has with 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.440
 time will let you notice what tires 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.550
 worn down and replaced brightly 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.650
 pronounced directional pattern 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.810
 tread of this model provides 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.639
 high grip characteristics 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.590
 loose snow and polished 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.569
 icy road you can 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.879
 advise when using winter 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.219
 tires now I would like to draw attention 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:09.180
 for timely replacement of winter tires on 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:12.580
 summer it is about that when 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.129
 temperature reaches average daily 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.930
 magnitudes of 5-7 degrees are already needed 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.949
 apply tires for summer because 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.110
 while moving 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.419
 in the warm season on winter tires they 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.439
 much faster wear name 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.439
 efficiency lead
