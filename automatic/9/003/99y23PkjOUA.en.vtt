00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I have to crouch slightly because as you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.929 
I have to crouch slightly because as you
can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.890> I've<00:00:25.980> stacked<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.519> here<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:26.820> it's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
can see I've stacked it up here but it's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
can see I've stacked it up here but it's
for<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.240> reason<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:28.050> quite<00:00:28.289> looking<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
for some reason not quite looking how it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
for some reason not quite looking how it
didn't<00:00:29.010> measure<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
didn't measure up I have to kind of go a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.600 
didn't measure up I have to kind of go a
strange<00:00:31.650> angle<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> can't<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.489> myself

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
strange angle because I can't get myself

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
strange angle because I can't get myself
all<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.570> too<00:00:33.660> close<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> mirror

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
all in if I get too close to the mirror

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.729

so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> crouch<00:00:36.210> slightly<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.140> also

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so I have to crouch slightly but also

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
so I have to crouch slightly but also
it's<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.489> new<00:00:38.640> forgive<00:00:39.390> me

old<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> few<00:00:46.410> years<00:00:46.620> old<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.829> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
old this is a few years old but they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
old this is a few years old but they
usually<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.700> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> oversized<00:00:48.480> thin

usually do some kind of oversized thin
knit<00:00:49.520> pretty<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.640> every<00:00:50.850> year<00:00:50.879> they've<00:00:51.120> got

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
knit pretty much every year they've got

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
knit pretty much every year they've got
something<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> moment<00:00:52.980> that's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
something in here at the moment that's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
something in here at the moment that's
definitely<00:00:53.399> similar<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.899> really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
definitely similar these are really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
definitely similar these are really
bizarre<00:00:55.590> I've<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.699> seen<00:00:56.730> anything

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
bizarre I've not really seen anything

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389

else<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.440> them<00:00:58.440> since<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.890> came<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.219> maybe

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
else like them since they came out maybe

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
else like them since they came out maybe
I<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.570> two<00:01:00.840> years<00:01:00.870> ago<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.559> was

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
I think two years ago when I was

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.750 
I think two years ago when I was
absolutely<00:01:02.070> obsessed<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.640> had

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
absolutely obsessed with them they had

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.609 
absolutely obsessed with them they had
them<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.780> grey<00:01:04.080> which<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> really

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
them in this and a grey which I really

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
them in this and a grey which I really
liked<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> couldn't<00:01:05.280> find<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
liked but I couldn't find and they're a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
liked but I couldn't find and they're a
strange<00:01:07.080> fit<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.740> wear<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.010> very

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
strange fit so I don't wear them very

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
strange fit so I don't wear them very
often<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.360> legs<00:01:09.570> they're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
often because down my legs they're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
often because down my legs they're
actually<00:01:10.020> quite<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.610> around<00:01:11.700> my

actually quite big and but around my
waist<00:01:12.060> they're<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.510> quite<00:01:12.600> tight<00:01:12.930> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
waist they're actually quite tight it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
waist they're actually quite tight it's
kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> annoying<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.850> wanted<00:01:15.060> there
