00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and that when I tell them that the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.610 
and that when I tell them that the
average<00:02:19.620> party<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.280> 500<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.930> believe<00:02:22.440> me

average party is 500 they believe me

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.559 
average party is 500 they believe me
because<00:02:22.830> they<00:02:23.099> can<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.520> here<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.239> true

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
because they can see here that it's true

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.339
