diem 200 organic LED gauge let's take a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.970 
diem 200 organic LED gauge let's take a
look<00:00:12.830> at<00:00:12.919> our<00:00:13.009> display<00:00:14.650> here<00:00:15.650> you're<00:00:15.830> looking

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
look at our display here you're looking

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.409 
look at our display here you're looking
at<00:00:16.219> it<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.580> diem<00:00:16.910> 200<00:00:17.539> organic<00:00:18.079> LED<00:00:18.849> OBD<00:00:19.849> gauge

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
at it the diem 200 organic LED OBD gauge

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.960 
at it the diem 200 organic LED OBD gauge
now<00:00:21.230> what's<00:00:21.470> nice<00:00:21.680> about<00:00:21.739> this<00:00:22.189> gauge<00:00:22.460> is<00:00:22.759> that

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
now what's nice about this gauge is that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.150 
now what's nice about this gauge is that
it<00:00:23.270> installs<00:00:24.079> in<00:00:24.410> seconds

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
it installs in seconds

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.790 
it installs in seconds
all<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:25.939> need<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.239> do<00:00:26.419> is<00:00:26.689> connect<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.469> your

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
all you need to do is connect to your

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.779 
all you need to do is connect to your
vehicle's<00:00:28.520> OBD<00:00:29.090> port<00:00:29.119> which<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:29.899> available<00:00:30.110> on

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
vehicle's OBD port which is available on

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.760 
vehicle's OBD port which is available on
1996<00:00:31.789> fulfils<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.329> up<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:33.050> much<00:00:33.320> with<00:00:33.500> all

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
1996 fulfils it up this much with all

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.940 
1996 fulfils it up this much with all
1996<00:00:34.700> vehicles<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.110> what<00:00:36.289> you<00:00:36.440> do<00:00:36.620> is<00:00:36.800> you

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
1996 vehicles and so what you do is you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.240 
1996 vehicles and so what you do is you
can<00:00:37.070> plug<00:00:37.340> in<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:38.030> your<00:00:38.059> OBD<00:00:38.600> port<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:39.320> your

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
can plug in to your OBD port and your

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.490 
can plug in to your OBD port and your
gauge<00:00:40.630> will<00:00:41.630> display<00:00:41.989> all<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
gauge will display all of the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.370 
gauge will display all of the
