00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 Aronia berry useful but not 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 very tasty and so what now 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 deprive yourself of vitamins after no 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.590
 it turns out blackflies can do 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.590
 great wine and now we will find out the recipe 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 Mikhail Borisovich I know what you have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 your own recipe 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 black wines 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.449
 and here you are already some kind of incomprehensible 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.449
 designs for us prepared that you are 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 This is the first stage of manufacturing the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.220
 same home wines when we collect 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 berries here are a basket of candles on a flat there 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.500
 surely come across leaflets of different 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.800
 kind of twigs and ask the same fat even eat 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.979
 snails here to remove them and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.430
 the black insect was clean here this thing 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.559
 everything is thought up here very simply 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 the plane the round berry rolls on 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 planes and roll into the basket and all 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.160
 same flat 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.899
 the same snails or get the same leaf 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.289
 does not remain here the experience we collect 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.509
 garbage them all so well that went over that 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.550
 now we do now when she 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.830
 already clean there is no garbage no 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.770
 nothing we have to skip through 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.409
 a meat grinder to heal differently under 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.149
 press it too tight and press and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.770
 just need to develop the effort to quests 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.470
 ie here take chernoplodki 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 so yes yes yes yes yes yes only 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.610
 meat grinder pick berries and fall asleep here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.870
 and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 I am starving here this basket we are with you 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.140
 about half an hour and not twisted yes 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 so and how much we get with this 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.390
 wine baskets 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 here are two baskets two baskets 1 will be from 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.900
 twenty liter 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.570
 Anya would have a full basket here 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.080
 grind and now we got 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.300
 for half the pan here this one 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.160
 mizgir poured mixed with juice we 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.130
 her 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.040
 upset about 50 in a big skirt 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.070
 liters wrong, both on a quest we 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.650
 leave this bug somewhere for the day 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.470
 three to four stormy to happen 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.590
 fermentation challenge rapid fermentation choose 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.410
 and we do not go there sopin swords to our hair 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 the zone of which it all depends on how you 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.260
 ripped off here called what degree 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.290
 readiness 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.439
 if she 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.459
 in the face of well ripened normally she can 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:38.950
 2-3 days if it is bad to wait a little 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.879
 more well ok then we assign here 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.329
 I 'll put it on 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:49.540
 again translated into a big block 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:54.430
 we are already fermented massively ready for 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.500
 What good is not pressing but now 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.170
 let's press this question 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.810
 ankle boots we will let go all the houses 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.530
 with through the press and give out squeeze out of it 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 the juice 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.959
 you put the piston here and start 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.959
 screwed up 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.700
 after we already got depressed 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.680
 juice we pour bottles now 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.730
 and we will continue the process 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.910
 manufacturing 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.800
 let's go pasha what is it now 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.340
 ready. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.070
 it's almost blown almost ready 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.420
 guilt liter bottle we pour 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.600
 drank water 15 liters of juice we fall asleep 3 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.990
 kilograms of sugar pre course 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.100
 in another bowl and stir them and the 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.390
 add here another three liters of clean water 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.090
 clean water is needed to 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.580
 neutralize available in each berry 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.800
 acidity otherwise you will be sour yes 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.910
 and as you can see here everything is made small 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.180
 stock for the stock is needed for what we 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.850
 then add three more pounds of sugar 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 and about 18-20 days 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.110
 add when this period 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.630
 peredel plays sugar ferment 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.540
 then we add fresh every month 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.030
 wine must be aired to 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.380
 he was gone harmful gases that is, we him 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.420
 just take some dishes 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.700
 here and then back pouring you for this 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.820
 moment while the guilt is poured in there and 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:49.620
 back everything superfluous disappears from it 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.490
 and on the back and when we transfused it 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.830
 remove sediment from the bottom a precipitate forms 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.690
 But in order for him not to blame is not recorded 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.900
 his necessarily us this is you from kostya 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.120
 then it is already possible in this 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.110
 have to lie well, it can be months 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.020
 in two 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.210
 can 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.849
 even through these bags here is not by chance 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.680
 they protect the liquid from the sun 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.300
 light thing is that on the flower 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.759
 chemical reactions occur 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.520
 which can negatively affect the taste 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:25.440
 guilt so we harbor them or clean 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.440
 in a dark place but not cold
