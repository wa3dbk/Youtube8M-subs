what's going on guys Bob buskirk here

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.640 
what's going on guys Bob buskirk here
again<00:00:02.550> at<00:00:02.790> think<00:00:03.240> computers<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.020> today<00:00:04.470> we're

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
again at think computers and today we're

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.499 
again at think computers and today we're
taking<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.950> look<00:00:04.980> at<00:00:05.279> some<00:00:05.640> brand<00:00:06.000> new<00:00:06.089> memory

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
taking a look at some brand new memory

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.080 
taking a look at some brand new memory
from<00:00:06.810> crucial<00:00:07.379> it's<00:00:07.649> their<00:00:08.429> ballistics

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
from crucial it's their ballistics

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.200 
from crucial it's their ballistics
tactical<00:00:09.900> LP<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> LP<00:00:11.610> stands<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.000> low

tactical LP and LP stands for low

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.299 
tactical LP and LP stands for low
profile<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.139> let's<00:00:13.259> go<00:00:13.380> ahead<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.740> check<00:00:13.830> them

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
profile so let's go ahead and check them

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.570 
profile so let's go ahead and check them
out

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.099 

taking<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.640> look<00:00:25.849> at<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.090> packaging<00:00:26.599> here<00:00:26.900> you

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
taking a look at the packaging here you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.330 
taking a look at the packaging here you
can<00:00:27.259> see<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:27.529> comes<00:00:27.710> in<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.070> know<00:00:28.099> your

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
can see it comes in the you know your

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.920 
can see it comes in the you know your
simple<00:00:28.789> clamshell<00:00:29.330> that<00:00:29.480> you're<00:00:29.630> used<00:00:29.810> to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
simple clamshell that you're used to

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.260 
simple clamshell that you're used to
seeing<00:00:30.109> memory<00:00:30.470> come<00:00:30.680> in<00:00:30.859> I<00:00:31.070> get<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:31.880> up<00:00:32.000> here

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
seeing memory come in I get it up here

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.080 
seeing memory come in I get it up here
really<00:00:32.599> close<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.230> guys<00:00:33.379> can<00:00:33.680> see<00:00:33.879> that<00:00:34.879> this

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
really close you guys can see that this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.740 
really close you guys can see that this
is<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.840> 16<00:00:36.290> gigabyte<00:00:36.650> kit<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.850> is<00:00:37.910> to<00:00:38.510> eight

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
is the 16 gigabyte kit it is to eight

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.990 
is the 16 gigabyte kit it is to eight
gig<00:00:39.020> sticks<00:00:39.790> ddr3<00:00:40.790> 1600<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.870> cl<00:00:42.620> eight<00:00:42.949> on<00:00:43.400> the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
gig sticks ddr3 1600 and cl eight on the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.240 
gig sticks ddr3 1600 and cl eight on the
back<00:00:44.210> there<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.780> some<00:00:45.019> information<00:00:45.290> about<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
back there is some information about the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.619 
back there is some information about the
ballistics<00:00:46.699> memory<00:00:47.030> but<00:00:47.210> let's<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:47.390> go

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
ballistics memory but let's just go

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.540 
ballistics memory but let's just go
ahead<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.050> open<00:00:48.800> these<00:00:49.070> up<00:00:49.129> here<00:00:51.430> should<00:00:52.430> be

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
ahead and open these up here should be

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.070 
ahead and open these up here should be
simple<00:00:52.909> enough<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:55.629> if<00:00:56.629> we<00:00:56.839> take<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.739> mount

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
simple enough and if we take the mount

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.579 
simple enough and if we take the mount
you<00:01:00.080> can<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.409> they<00:01:00.589> are<00:01:00.729> extremely<00:01:02.229> small<00:01:03.229> and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
you can see they are extremely small and

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.630 
you can see they are extremely small and
that<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.430> because<00:01:04.610> they<00:01:05.000> are<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.449> low-profile

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
that is because they are the low-profile

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.280 
that is because they are the low-profile
sticks<00:01:07.640> now<00:01:07.820> why<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:08.600> want<00:01:08.780> low<00:01:08.900> profile

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
sticks now why do you want low profile

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.020 
sticks now why do you want low profile
sticks<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.130> main<00:01:10.369> reason<00:01:10.549> is<00:01:10.820> because

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
sticks the main reason is because

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.410 
sticks the main reason is because
aftermarket<00:01:11.960> CPU<00:01:12.350> coolers<00:01:13.119> especially<00:01:14.119> air

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
aftermarket CPU coolers especially air

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.420 
aftermarket CPU coolers especially air
coolers<00:01:14.960> will<00:01:16.810> cover<00:01:17.810> up<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.439> lot<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:19.009> your

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
coolers will cover up a lot of your

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.640 
coolers will cover up a lot of your
memory<00:01:19.909> slots<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.960> means<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.350> can't

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
memory slots and this means you can't

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.740 
memory slots and this means you can't
use<00:01:21.770> high<00:01:22.250> performance<00:01:22.790> aftermarket<00:01:23.210> memory

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
use high performance aftermarket memory

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.080 
use high performance aftermarket memory
you<00:01:23.900> have<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.259> use<00:01:24.409> something<00:01:25.189> really<00:01:25.340> crappy

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
you have to use something really crappy

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.239 
you have to use something really crappy
something<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:26.960> doesn't<00:01:27.170> work<00:01:28.070> really

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
something that just doesn't work really

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.010 
something that just doesn't work really
well<00:01:28.369> or<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.759> lot<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.210> times<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.600> can't<00:01:29.840> even

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
well or a lot of times you can't even

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.200 
well or a lot of times you can't even
fit<00:01:30.350> memory<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.859> those<00:01:31.039> slots<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:31.999> is

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
fit memory in those slots and this is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.029 
fit memory in those slots and this is
where<00:01:32.359> these<00:01:32.600> kids<00:01:33.109> come<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.590> they're<00:01:33.770> very

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
where these kids come in they're very

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.760 
where these kids come in they're very
small<00:01:34.429> very<00:01:35.210> very<00:01:35.570> low<00:01:35.780> profile<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:36.499> if<00:01:36.530> we<00:01:36.649> go

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
small very very low profile so if we go

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.539 
small very very low profile so if we go
over<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.249> um<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:38.240> know<00:01:38.359> just<00:01:38.570> on<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:38.840> front

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
over here um you know just on the front

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.950 
over here um you know just on the front
basically<00:01:40.549> your<00:01:40.729> same<00:01:40.969> as<00:01:41.210> your<00:01:41.539> normal

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
basically your same as your normal

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.349 
basically your same as your normal
tactical<00:01:42.499> memory<00:01:42.829> if<00:01:43.399> you're<00:01:43.640> familiar<00:01:44.030> with

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
tactical memory if you're familiar with

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.349 
tactical memory if you're familiar with
crucial<00:01:45.319> ballistix<00:01:45.770> tactical<00:01:46.640> memory<00:01:46.850> looks

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
crucial ballistix tactical memory looks

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.580 
crucial ballistix tactical memory looks
pretty<00:01:47.509> much<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.749> same<00:01:47.869> except<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:48.469> it's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
pretty much the same except for it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.989 
pretty much the same except for it's
just<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.799> lot<00:01:48.920> smaller<00:01:49.189> so<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.850> nice

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
just a lot smaller so you have the nice

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.419 
just a lot smaller so you have the nice
heat<00:01:50.210> spreader<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.890> then<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:52.249> side

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
heat spreader here and then on this side

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.599 
heat spreader here and then on this side
you<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.479> your<00:01:53.689> information<00:01:54.549> see<00:01:55.549> if

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
you have all of your information see if

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.550 
you have all of your information see if
he'll<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.819> zoom<00:01:55.969> in<00:01:56.090> there<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.329> go<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.439> can

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
he'll to zoom in there you go so you can

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.010 
he'll to zoom in there you go so you can
see<00:01:57.889> all<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.880> timings<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.329> 8<00:01:59.569> 8<00:01:59.780> 8

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
see all that with the timings of 8 8 8

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.709 
see all that with the timings of 8 8 8
24<00:02:00.679> at<00:02:00.859> one<00:02:01.159> point<00:02:01.340> 35<00:02:01.969> volts<00:02:02.210> these<00:02:02.420> are<00:02:02.539> also

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
24 at one point 35 volts these are also

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.660 
24 at one point 35 volts these are also
low<00:02:03.469> voltage<00:02:03.920> which<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.159> going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.399> be<00:02:04.460> good

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
low voltage which is going to be good

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.039 
low voltage which is going to be good
which<00:02:04.850> means<00:02:05.060> we<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.389> really<00:02:05.569> push<00:02:05.840> these

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
which means we can really push these
