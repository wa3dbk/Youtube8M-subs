a bit like and you know I'm not really

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.800 
a bit like and you know I'm not really
enjoying<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:14.910> yeah<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.660> not

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
enjoying this and but but yeah it's not

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.390

the league and its mixture not only
players<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.530> think<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.459> why<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:21.359> pay<00:04:21.900> for

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140

you know because it's with players that
aren't<00:04:35.009> as<00:04:35.159> good<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.759> kind<00:04:35.969> of<00:04:36.030> makes<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
aren't as good so it kind of makes it a

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.119 
aren't as good so it kind of makes it a
little<00:04:36.659> bit<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.960> can't<00:04:37.199> compare<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> same

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
little bit you can't compare it the same

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.890
