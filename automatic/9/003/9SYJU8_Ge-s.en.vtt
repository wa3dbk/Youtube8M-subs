00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.040
 without a doubt one of the most news 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.529
 important of the microsoft event 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.769
 about windows 10 is that they had not happened 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.099
 nor 20 minutes since the beginning of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.499
 event and the first news was the most 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.069
 important and the one that microsoft already 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:22.710
 I was surprising with this news 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:24.509
 about what he had wanted to give a blow 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.519
 on the table by promising that this 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.579
 update windows 10 to windows 10 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.829
 It will be completely free not only for 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.649
 Windows 8.1 users in which case 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.359
 this was quite expected 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.879
 quite that out for windows 8.1 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.640
 totally free but also for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 the windows 7 users that has been 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 totally the surprise in the event of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.199
 more in depth presentation of windows 10 and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.499
 about other products like what would be 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.539
 holmes a matter of graphics gold but 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.339
 that we focus more on windows 10 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.239
 because it is the star product of 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.980
 Microsoft anyway to the gratuity 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.460
 of the update will come with a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.920
 small but 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.770
 it is not known if it will be possible to do 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 grade of windows 7 without paying anything this 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.420
 have said that in the first year after 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 that launches windows 10 everything is in that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.220
 year we will be able to update 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.890
 windows 10 from windows 7 and windows 8.1 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.040
 totally free you do not know how it will be 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 the middle of the system what would be the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.630
 Windows 10 marketing after 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.630
 of that year that we have updated what 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 more likely as it says what is said 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.360
 but reimers mails are that is the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.409
 in charge of the product part of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.399
 windows 10 in microsoft 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.799
 it would be a matter of something very similar 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.409
 office 365 that is by subscription 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.539
 this would be focused mostly on the 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.689
 part that all users have 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.319
 the latest version of windows 10 of 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.509
 windows in future versions of windows 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.509
 as it is office 365 with what would be 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.209
 that he has 8 is entitled to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.640
 download to install if we have 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.769
 an office 365 subscription what 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.930
 would be office then here we are going to have 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.700
 the latest version also in windows 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.040
 this what is more important we have in 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.319
 windows 10 it is believed that a 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.569
 permanent license to those who take advantage 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.590
 this temporary offer during the first 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.319
 year of windows 10 then you go by in 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.959
 what would be windows 7 or windows 8.1 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.519
 directly to windows 10 also it 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.120
 confirms as we see in the image that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.120
 windows phones 8.1 would have update 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.580
 direct to what would be windows 10 mobile 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 would be next the next version of the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.379
 operating system for smartphones or 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.200
 for your Lumia phones about what 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:56.049
 would be windows 10 then these are the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.269
 two news that has caused the most 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.150
 surprise with these ads that do not 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.569
 we knew we had some vision that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.290
 windows 10 could be free for 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.870
 all but I think with this move of 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.879
 have windows 10 free for the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.090
 first year to update 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.629
 users of windows 7 and windows 8 points 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.079
 8.1 I think it's a pretty solution 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:27.319
 right in terms of how it's going to continue 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.269
 maintaining his empire his use his method 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.799
 with which it acquires much more income 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.140
 microsoft that is through the 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.840
 licensing windows and going to be able 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.239
 fulfill what is going to be able to satisfy those 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 users who suddenly when buying a 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.319
 team with windows 8.1 is still very 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.239
 was very recent to launch a 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.950
 windows 10 version there is going to have 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.360
 microsoft that all your computers are going to 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.550
 be updated we are not going to 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.470
 the same problem we have with 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.540
 windows xp what is happening this 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.640
 problem in companies since a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.510
 operating system so old that it has 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.120
 more than almost 14 years of being in the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.880
 market then suffer the same problem 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.700
 with future versions of windows what 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.110
 what is windows 8.1 windows 10 or the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.480
 future versions coming from windows 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.970
 that all users have in the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.269
 less possible time those future 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.150
 versions then this what you want 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.280
 microsoft and also what they look for not 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.200
 just like as an operating system but 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.450
 who is looking for what would be the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.000
 unification of all its platforms already 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.760
 we know we can have applications or 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.760
 the so-called universal applications in 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.890
 what is all the devices all 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.100
 Microsoft platforms such as 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.460
 mobile devices tablets smartphones 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.889
 as is the operating system for 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.530
 portable computers desktop computers 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.690
 also for what would be teams like 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.380
 what would it be just james that is what 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.289
 I commented Holographic glasses 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.319
 very stylish style to return the future 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.819
 but with an augmented reality and some 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.400
 issues that are quite important 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.699
 quite interesting as well 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.069
 include what would be windows 10 on xbox 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.509
 one there we will also have what 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.009
 it would be windows 10 we are also going to have 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.889
 those applications that are going to run on 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.479
 this platform and this is what has 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.460
 beloved microsoft since always from 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.060
 that started with his idea of ​​unifying 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.520
 these platforms when launching windows 8 and 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.740
 its interface for all of them 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.380
 we already know that this whole question of the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.139
 free update come to us 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.570
 to be able to update to that version yet 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.520
 the method or the way of 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.470
 update is not known if it will be the 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.630
 same via update that was from 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.250
 windows 8 to windows 8.1 that was by 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.470
 middle of the windows store 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.190
 I would rather believe that it can be for the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.590
 via 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.810
 of windows update since they had given 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.640
 some problems this update to 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.530
 through the windows store you know 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.570
 that sometimes the windows store suffers 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.550
 some problems some errors and then 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.100
 there were inconveniences at the time of 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.320
 update from windows 8 to windows 8.1 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.020
 would I create that is by windows update and 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.760
 you have to wait next week they go 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.310
 to launch new built new investments 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.040
 cfi technical preview that has already released 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.870
 microsoft for a long time and we're going to 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.180
 see what is incorporated in those new 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.000
 versions we already know that from that 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.280
 technical preview we are going to be able to 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.330
 update and install future ones 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.070
 versions that are published from windows 10 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.410
 it is not known if there is going to be a consumer 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.930
 preview or if you are going to launch directly 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.630
 a version in which we know 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.940
 previously as rtm release takes 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.980
 future then we do not know yet in 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.470
 true science how is the method going to be 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.020
 of licensing windows 10 after 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.850
 that that year would pass than it would be the 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.610
 year of grace or the year of update 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.920
 free for users with 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.920
 windows 7 or windows 8.1 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.340
 I would believe that tip according to the rumors 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.500
 to what can be a subscription for 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.380
 have windows 10 as well as what is office 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.590
 365 then we will be very attentive 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.990
 we will be analyzing the future buils 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.460
 that they release in the next week also 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.760
 it has been confirmed that windows 10 for 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.810
 Mobile equipment will be available in the 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.880
 month of february 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.130
 then we will be seeing this already 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.810
 there is to appreciate a lot this 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.940
