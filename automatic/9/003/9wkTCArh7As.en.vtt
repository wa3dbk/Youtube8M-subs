00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
something like that there is another

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.980 
something like that there is another
video<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> made<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:23.880> doing<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.480> alcohol

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
video I made about doing with alcohol

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
video I made about doing with alcohol
the<00:00:25.260> alcohol<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> great<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.160> does<00:00:26.430> work<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the alcohol is great it does work but it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
the alcohol is great it does work but it
does<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.660> longer<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.710> reason

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
does take a little longer and the reason

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.290 
does take a little longer and the reason
why<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> does<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.670> seems<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
why it does it just seems that this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.959 
why it does it just seems that this
stuff<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.570> stays<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.590> longer<00:00:31.980> when

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
stuff just stays on there longer when

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
stuff just stays on there longer when
you<00:00:33.030> put<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> nail<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.960> seems<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> dry

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you put it on the nail it seems to dry

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
you put it on the nail it seems to dry
the<00:00:34.590> nail<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.130> keep<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> dryness<00:00:35.910> era

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the nail out and keep that dryness era

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.920 
the nail out and keep that dryness era
where<00:00:36.570> whereas<00:00:37.079> alcohol<00:00:37.649> seems<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.660> just<00:00:39.660> kind

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
where whereas alcohol seems to just kind

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500 
where whereas alcohol seems to just kind
