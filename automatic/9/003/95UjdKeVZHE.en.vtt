is<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.149> side<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> rebels<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
is that one side is for the rebels and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
is that one side is for the rebels and
one<00:01:04.830> side<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> Imperials<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.390> like

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
one side is for the Imperials just like

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.679 
one side is for the Imperials just like
with<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.869> x-wing<00:01:07.409> although<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:09.000> x-wing<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
with my x-wing although with x-wing I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
with my x-wing although with x-wing I
actually<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.080> two<00:01:10.229> separate<00:01:10.530> cases<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.100> for

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
actually have two separate cases now for

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.960 
actually have two separate cases now for
that<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.549> Imperials<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that one is for the Imperials and one is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
that one is for the Imperials and one is
for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> rebels<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> case<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.229> have

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
for the rebels in this case I don't have

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
for the rebels in this case I don't have
enough<00:01:16.590> shifts<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> yet<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.270> side

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
enough shifts for that yet so one side

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
enough shifts for that yet so one side
is<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> rebels<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.560> side<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
is for the rebels and one side is for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.270 
is for the rebels and one side is for
the<00:01:20.189> Imperials<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.210> here's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.799> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.360 
over I've got some other tokens on this
side<00:03:44.609> but<00:03:44.879> ones<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.269> generally<00:03:45.750> don't<00:03:45.959> use<00:03:46.500> but

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
side but ones I generally don't use but

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.740 
side but ones I generally don't use but
I<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.639> them<00:03:47.819> in<00:03:47.940> case<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.299> need<00:03:48.510> them<00:03:48.629> for

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I have them in case I need them for

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.629 
I have them in case I need them for
whatever<00:03:48.930> reason<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.949> for<00:03:50.190> example<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
whatever reason like for example I

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.490 
whatever reason like for example I
believe<00:03:50.970> these<00:03:51.239> numbers<00:03:51.720> here<00:03:51.750> are<00:03:52.169> for

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
believe these numbers here are for

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.339 
believe these numbers here are for
identifying<00:03:53.099> ships<00:03:53.879> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.180> same<00:03:54.389> type<00:03:54.659> so<00:03:55.229> if

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
identifying ships of the same type so if

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.080 
identifying ships of the same type so if
you<00:03:55.439> have<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.979> same<00:03:56.010> x-wing<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
you have like the same x-wing on the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.030 
you have like the same x-wing on the
battlefield<00:03:57.599> and<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.829> general

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
battlefield and it's just the general

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.710 
battlefield and it's just the general
x-wing<00:03:59.609> and<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.879> need<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.060> way<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.239> tell<00:04:00.569> them

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
x-wing and you need a way to tell them

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.259 
x-wing and you need a way to tell them
apart<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.590> use<00:04:01.799> these<00:04:01.949> numbers<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.340> you've

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
apart you use these numbers here you've

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.089 
apart you use these numbers here you've
got<00:04:03.299> some<00:04:03.659> other<00:04:03.810> ones<00:04:04.139> here<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:04.709> not<00:04:04.829> exactly

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
got some other ones here I'm not exactly

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.369 
got some other ones here I'm not exactly
sure<00:04:05.310> what<00:04:05.579> they<00:04:05.699> do<00:04:05.759> yet<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.319> think

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
sure what they do yet this one I think

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.280 
sure what they do yet this one I think
is<00:04:07.709> for<00:04:08.479> whenever<00:04:09.479> you're<00:04:09.780> setting<00:04:10.109> up<00:04:10.259> your

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
is for whenever you're setting up your

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.319 
is for whenever you're setting up your
game<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.889> play<00:04:11.099> mat<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.819> can<00:04:11.849> set<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.299> the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
game on the play mat you can set up the

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.539 
game on the play mat you can set up the
play<00:04:12.720> area<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.109> define<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.680> play<00:04:13.949> area<00:04:14.189> and

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
play area or define the play area and

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.399 
play area or define the play area and
then<00:04:14.669> define<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.120> set<00:04:15.299> up<00:04:15.449> area<00:04:15.780> using<00:04:15.959> these

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
then define the set up area using these

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.440 
then define the set up area using these
and<00:04:16.829> then<00:04:17.250> some<00:04:17.400> other<00:04:17.459> miscellaneous<00:04:18.029> tokens

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
and then some other miscellaneous tokens

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.610 
and then some other miscellaneous tokens
that<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:18.659> generally<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.079> don't<00:04:19.469> use

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
that I generally just don't use

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.920 
that I generally just don't use
if<00:04:21.620> we<00:04:21.739> flip<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.310> open<00:04:22.820> like<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.390> this<00:04:23.570> is<00:04:23.720> for

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
if we flip this open like so this is for

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.980 
if we flip this open like so this is for
the<00:04:23.960> Imperial<00:04:24.800> side<00:04:25.540> again<00:04:26.540> I've<00:04:26.660> got<00:04:26.810> all<00:04:26.960> of

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the Imperial side again I've got all of

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.170 
the Imperial side again I've got all of
my<00:04:27.140> squadrons<00:04:27.890> on<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> left-hand<00:04:28.520> side<00:04:28.670> I

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
my squadrons on the left-hand side I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.660 
my squadrons on the left-hand side I
believe<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.870> have<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.380> same<00:04:30.770> number<00:04:31.100> as<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.520> did

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
believe I have the same number as I did

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.580 
believe I have the same number as I did
with<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.910> rebels<00:04:32.030> I've<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.600> tie<00:04:32.870> bombers<00:04:33.290> to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
with the rebels I've to tie bombers to

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.980 
with the rebels I've to tie bombers to
tie<00:04:33.800> interceptors<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:35.060> tie<00:04:35.300> advanced<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:35.960> I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
tie interceptors to tie advanced and I

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.200 
tie interceptors to tie advanced and I
think<00:04:36.230> 6<00:04:36.500> tie<00:04:36.740> fighters<00:04:37.130> four<00:04:37.370> Tie<00:04:37.610> Fighters<00:04:37.880> I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
think 6 tie fighters four Tie Fighters I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.190 
think 6 tie fighters four Tie Fighters I
believe<00:04:38.890> came<00:04:39.890> with<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:41.570> core<00:04:41.870> game<00:04:42.170> yeah<00:04:43.100> and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
believe came with the core game yeah and

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.950 
believe came with the core game yeah and
no<00:04:45.200> I'm<00:04:45.350> actually<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.770> more<00:04:45.890> than<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.190> I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
no I'm actually have more than that I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.570 
no I'm actually have more than that I
have<00:04:47.960> one<00:04:48.200> two<00:04:48.380> three<00:04:48.620> four<00:04:48.860> five<00:04:48.890> six<00:04:49.340> seven

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
have one two three four five six seven

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.800 
have one two three four five six seven
eight<00:04:49.910> so<00:04:51.670> yeah<00:04:52.670> it's<00:04:52.820> very<00:04:53.030> possible<00:04:53.300> that<00:04:53.660> i

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
eight so yeah it's very possible that i

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.760 
eight so yeah it's very possible that i
think<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.080> course<00:04:54.320> that<00:04:54.380> might<00:04:54.530> have<00:04:54.650> come

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
think the course that might have come

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.800 
think the course that might have come
with<00:04:54.950> 6<00:04:55.160> tie<00:04:55.340> fighters<00:04:55.760> instead<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.240> four<00:04:56.600> and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
with 6 tie fighters instead of four and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.870 
with 6 tie fighters instead of four and
then<00:04:57.290> two<00:04:57.620> more<00:04:57.830> came<00:04:58.160> with<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.550> imperial

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
then two more came with the imperial

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.550 
then two more came with the imperial
fighter<00:04:59.300> squadron<00:04:59.870> expansion<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.440> i<00:05:00.470> have

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
fighter squadron expansion so i have

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800 
fighter squadron expansion so i have
eight<00:05:00.740> tie<00:05:01.040> fighters<00:05:01.520> here<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:02.300> tie<00:05:02.540> advanced

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
eight tie fighters here to tie advanced

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.630 
eight tie fighters here to tie advanced
too<00:05:03.020> tight<00:05:03.200> acceptors<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.950> tie<00:05:04.220> bombers

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
too tight acceptors and to tie bombers

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.420 
too tight acceptors and to tie bombers
over<00:05:04.820> here<00:05:05.300> I've<00:05:05.420> got<00:05:05.810> my<00:05:06.260> speed<00:05:06.770> dials<00:05:07.220> and
