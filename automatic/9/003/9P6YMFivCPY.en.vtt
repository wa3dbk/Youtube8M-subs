00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.060
 Indigenous communities especially 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.289
 those of hot earth this is a 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 cultural issue

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.510
 people like Mr. Jesus ortiz that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.460
 since he was 8 he learned to do 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 hammocks since it was the punishment that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 they put their parents in today they 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.519

 a server my wife my my children 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.939
 They sleep in a hammock and we have 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.950
 cotton and we have nylon when it does 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.439
 very hot are the cotton ones when 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.329
 are not the nylon ones recommended 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 sleep in a crossed way because of 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.409

 in fact it has been proven in a way 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.740
 scientific and there are scientific studies 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.940
 experiments that have confirmed that the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.610
