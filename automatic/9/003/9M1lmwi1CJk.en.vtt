00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 Giant mood in the second of the choir currency from Callaway 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.850
 for a final game 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.399
 the boss change Joop 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.849
 which now begins between Motherwell wishes for a year 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.519
 and only one leak empty 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 as expected, has high-class play in the semifinals 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.149
 Porto Elbe life with 248 to 242 against 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 Holtz won the bar and the audience 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.810
 that can not calm down at all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.829
 due to this game 10 strikes, Butz opera have availed nothing of countering what 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.770
 Dolla PBL 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.500
 the mistake of this big tip next to sixth frame of the neck 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 Broken 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 By the way, Hornberger is now working on it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330
 the negative balance for him 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
 to improve 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 16 titles had won 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 but in contrast there are 25 second places 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.770
 in the final the goal of Loren as won 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.470
 it is his personal goal 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.540
 to equalize this record 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 Of course, there are some tournaments to win 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.010
 they saw it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.080
 competition 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 rehearsed at the Minogue 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.600
 he has already added a second place this year 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 drive against the world and lost 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 against a rookie what did Final have to do 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.120
 once his nerves we have to get a grip 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.100
 and of course that's all else 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.549
 as a good start 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.490
 for brownish player the 31-year-old 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 from Saxony New York 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 Allschwil from nervousness 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.660
 You can really say that plays very far left 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.910
 dry in the area for the left-hander and 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.830
 he says goodbye to the left into the gutter 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.990
 that happens 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.610
 maybe every 20 years, once he's right-hander, the sevens PIN 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.109
 he was the best 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.349
 new in this wake wants over 238 lives 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.929
 There he has his whole body in this second ball 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.009
 well let out about this first mistake maybe not even 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.269
 bad 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.679
 that is now 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.289
 it may not be angry 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.069
 thinking about his game may have an automatic message maybe 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.839
 better 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.439
 No, no second time 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.639
 this luck 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.809
 that you can fly to the point of one 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.499
 Maybe you can understand 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.979
 a few times something 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.399
 Rotter wheels moment that is yes 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.569
 more one 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 specially equipped microphone 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 The US colleagues might expect a few of them 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.299
 insider information though 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.229
 Rotthalm端nster course 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 with the best will you not comment on his game since my 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.969
 finally the strike for him 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.619
 after 2 9 9 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.399
 will be very nice 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.149
 on the lane to high density of this ball runs out and 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.719
 startled and again such a serve 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.979
 plays a lot of competition 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.979
 good but all of the clarification 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.079
 not the desired double 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.189
 Of course it can happen 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.189
 just the tens 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.969
 There are two good balls in a row 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.969
 and only fair 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.759
 for Boyle's explanation 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.969
 the actual his second 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.200
 tv-final is his first but few one 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.139
 the parents of her 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.819
 mind 1900 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 94 in the final of the avec Maas das 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.749
 and then in his first game he hit 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.179
 a colleague and grows the us mission result of 1898 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.539
 two and ten cost 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.509
 furthermore, 30 thousand dollars extra premium 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.139
 So he already proved that he 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.289
 in front of the camera does not collapse of nervousness Auer 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.529
 same as 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.500
 Warnem端nde again to enter a final and then 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.120
 and I wanted 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.529
 first meeting is of course something special 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.529
 but now seems to have caught himself after this first mistake 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.039
 and probably will 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.270
 Taulant, I hope 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.590
 to deliver a tough match 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.039
 Hermann Wolter ridge my opinion there 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.059
 not quite share 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.239
 a 300 ha this week one of a total of 8 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.659
 and although they grant 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.879
 300 ha 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.379
 played their kenne 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.529
 but not on these specially installed scales but 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.129
 in the cellar, the beans in the bowling center in Cannes in view 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.360
 where the 42 games 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 He speaks with that 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.120
 if they feel right now 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.700
 there must be something on the train that she gives her that noise 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.789
 from the whale of R端hl Gr端n's listener I can calm her of course 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.020
 Not 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.129
 but he deliberately plays his role choice 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.449
 the two fingers holes and the thumb still 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.099
 to avoid any rotations the ball is dead straight on this 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.379
 Single voices cool 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.009
 to shoot 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.150
 a strike on goods 3 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.729
 since then apparently lighter there 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.319
 So the sticking point here on the bank you on the right wing 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.999
 which already well so bot has become the fatality 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.759
 a leak is empty 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.689
 Scene and class couples 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.689
 no question at all 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.569
 and it looks like he has 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.569
 the two were little trouble 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.820
 but he still lies back through the mistakes first free 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.780
 but still 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.360
 well played 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.490
 he only has to 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.610
 win this one game 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.080
 is the tournament winner 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.749
 that's the bonus 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:37.560
 for the best player of the week 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.499
 in this system 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.610
 one set 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.759
 from the town hall suggest but just 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.860
 the as a portrait Williams 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.779
 Look through this double 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.110
 completely empty 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.930
 marry now 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.330
 and it's time for wanted role 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
 may come up with something on the right lane 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.249
 he reacts with the pace varies 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.399
 back in the alley year 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.659
 well on the backsupplier because it is again now 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.659
 the foursome for the third time 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.199
 either he has to pretend or play a little harder or 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.889
 something from both 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:28.359
 Meanwhile, the promoted to the first and second Boeing 

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:29.860
 Bundesliga fest 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.409
 Goettingen Munich Hamburg and Frankfurt have the jump in the first 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.029
 League made it 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.110
 in the second part see second Bundesliga traveled the promoted 

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:42.149
 Stuttgart II calls a casting of eels in the south as well as a burning cigar 

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:43.979
 look in Hamburg in the north
