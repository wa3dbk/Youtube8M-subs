00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 many parents and grandparents 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 or should we really be difficult? 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.199
 something like this is already prepared for a bowl of water 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.140
 and a small price question will leave the results 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 and the World Champion returns to fill it in just 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.020
 Euro or a cream cheese Becker with water and put go 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.979
 exemplary led 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.630
 for the second try 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.900
 we have a castle dog here 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.390
 school clock 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 a big success 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900
 a small pot 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.040
 the water is 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.540
 and an international match 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 but that was it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 Bundesliga just go 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.320
 as I said 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.120
 Media like the radiate 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.280
 with water from the pipe 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.590
 and how would they see their schools? 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.590
 how important sectors are at their best 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.930
 these states are cold water without our master 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.059
 and this water is also spiderman as the camp tap water 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.110
 and currently it looks down 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 On this occasion you can explain very well 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.320
 so must Wiley be with a volley 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.850
 Federer's water is always down to the ground 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.830
 like this one 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.850
 in summer it is warmer water 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.410
 we play quietly though 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.650
 and again this fever or something 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.250
 it must be said 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.679
 depending on the temperature, a different density 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.229
 colloquially war is worldwide 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.760
 no miracle finally 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.110
 for example, lowering centimeters of water at 25 degrees Celsius easier 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.110
 as a cubic centimeter of water at four degrees Celsius 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.860
 By the way, what's up with financial us is the worst 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.790
 and that's why we say 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.820
 what about this temperature 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.560
 downward 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 and that has a lot like the Nielsen Andreas Dietz 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 so it's suicide and care 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.729
 that's starting in october 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.089
 and not because of them 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 Novartis will 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.419
 and this is 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 and in the pond we have always said yes 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.329
 4 degrees cell she US 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.219
 and in the summer we'll just start 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.469
 25 degrees cell us 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.640
 that should be clean with the water 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.650
 the water gets colder than 4 according to Henze 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.049
 it will be easier again 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.519
 Daniel DeuÃŸer also the density anomalies of water 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.979
 and in German that means 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.479
 the niece of the water because the Bernese others 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.749
 Stoffel from Norway 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 Therefore, the heavy water advises at four degrees Celsius 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.330
 also the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.689
 as in Bern 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.019
 flying down in the valley 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.900
 above 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.869
 Zoom, the water is getting colder 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:03.760
 but as 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.789
 lighter 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.799
 and if the water temperature is up here then 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.659
 0 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.999
 Silvio 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.559
 drops 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.559
 Feb the water her problem 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 satisfied 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.499
 so then both ice layer stand 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.139
 and only so 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.839
 probably also because of that 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.869
 in former times was in a hurry 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.239
 follows upper abdomen back 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.150
 from Gunten 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.579
 up 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.569
 we even quickly accept a little experiment as one 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.789
 everything is possible 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.979
 leader is full of water but foul 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.719
 that was harmony in the plus the authorities lifted happened 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.759
 and the ice schedule from the water again high 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.969
 those for the Siegen questions 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.159
 how all the ice has melted 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.599
 there the water 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.479
 out 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.810
 "They were live 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.829
 when the ice is completely melted 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.809
 sign up now forever 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:15.349
 how come that 1 is melted and of course the vehicle 12 is not over 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:17.739
 what was 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.049
 she has spatially expanded at died 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.330
 the amount of water 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.449
 but has remained the same 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.599
 The next experiment is simple 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.249
 but had to show and young and old 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.150
 how difficult it was the 4th 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.480
 their ice cubes from the freezer they send their native authors and 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.270
 run the dress up 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.270
 the celebration part 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.379
 the Hawkeye Ice-Slippery Shiite 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.819
 the authorities felt pressure 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.520
 the girls crashed Subkov 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.560
 because here, and must be as in a relationship 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.689
 from the 3 to make such a sense 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.529
 So 3 is not one 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.360
 a part since 1 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.330
 and now start again just so lied when green reconnecting them 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.339
 the ice cream with the song as 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.990
 and there is no solution 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 the special minus ten degrees Celsius 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.389
 July was Massa was 25 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.550
 beats directly 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.969
 also the small village 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.969
 and not very conclusive but directly fixed 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.520
 you can tell that too 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.669
 big cheers 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.219
 you can see you already that the surface of the village performance 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.449
 bit by bit 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.529
 how does the right one look like a layer? 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.569
 with the production of tires 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.240
 we are off again this time 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.559
 our experts 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.949
 the next option is she gives us this surface tension of water 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.800
 And saving on these can be very exciting 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.400
 I already warned him about that
