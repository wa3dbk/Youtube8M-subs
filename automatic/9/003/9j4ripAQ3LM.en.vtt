00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

in<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.630> last<00:00:00.840> two<00:00:01.079> videos<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.620> learned<00:00:01.800> where

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
in the last two videos we learned where

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.889 
in the last two videos we learned where
all<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.550> names<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> notes<00:00:03.330> are<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all the names of the notes are on the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.260 
all the names of the notes are on the
neck<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.350> banjo<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.009> now<00:00:05.670> it's<00:00:05.850> time<00:00:06.089> to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
neck of the banjo and now it's time to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.059 
neck of the banjo and now it's time to
learn<00:00:06.390> about<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.779> most<00:00:06.899> fundamental<00:00:07.259> scale

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
learn about the most fundamental scale

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.060 
learn about the most fundamental scale
in<00:00:08.280> music<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.910> major<00:00:09.150> scale<00:00:09.679> so<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> first

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
in music the major scale so in the first

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
in music the major scale so in the first
video<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.550> learned<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.120> twelve

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
video we learned that there are twelve

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.930 
video we learned that there are twelve
notes<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.049> all<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> music<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> problem

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
notes in all the music but the problem

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029 
notes in all the music but the problem
is<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> play<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:15.990> twelve<00:00:16.500> notes<00:00:16.650> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is that if you play all twelve notes in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.670 
is that if you play all twelve notes in
a<00:00:17.100> row<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> no<00:00:18.539> discernible<00:00:18.900> home<00:00:19.410> base

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
a row there is no discernible home base

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
a row there is no discernible home base
or<00:00:19.920> center<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.609> them<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.390> scale<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:22.020> we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
or center to them the scale is what we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590 
or center to them the scale is what we
call<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.650> tonal<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.029> something<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
call a tonal just like if something is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.609 
call a tonal just like if something is
not<00:00:25.199> symmetrical<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.099> call<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> asymmetrical

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
not symmetrical we call it asymmetrical

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
not symmetrical we call it asymmetrical
so<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> major<00:00:29.039> scale<00:00:29.400> does<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.939> pluck

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so what the major scale does is pluck

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
so what the major scale does is pluck
out<00:00:30.630> seven<00:00:31.410> notes<00:00:31.679> from<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> twelve<00:00:32.730> possible

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
out seven notes from the twelve possible

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840 
out seven notes from the twelve possible
notes<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.500> gives<00:00:34.739> us<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.010> scale<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.280> does

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
notes and it gives us a scale that does

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
notes and it gives us a scale that does
have<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.420> discernible<00:00:36.930> home<00:00:37.230> base<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.680> center

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
have a discernible home base or center

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.720 
have a discernible home base or center
and<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.300> call<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.809> key<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and that's what we call a key so what is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
and that's what we call a key so what is
a<00:00:41.760> major<00:00:42.210> scale<00:00:42.510> well<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.379> formula

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
a major scale well it's just a formula

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.369 
a major scale well it's just a formula
of<00:00:44.190> distances<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.079> video<00:00:46.230> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of distances and in the first video we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
of distances and in the first video we
learned<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.160> distance<00:00:47.610> between<00:00:47.789> one

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
learned that the distance between one

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
learned that the distance between one
key<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.870> fret<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> called<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.649> half-step

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
key or one fret is called a half-step

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
key or one fret is called a half-step
and<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.879> distance<00:00:51.270> between<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.840> keys<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.289> two

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and the distance between two keys or two

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
and the distance between two keys or two
frets<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> called<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.460> whole<00:00:53.610> step<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
frets is called a whole step so the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 
frets is called a whole step so the
formula<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.530> major<00:00:55.770> scale<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.340> whole

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
formula for our major scale is whole

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.590 
formula for our major scale is whole
step<00:00:57.629> whole<00:00:58.289> step<00:00:58.350> half<00:00:59.340> step<00:00:59.399> whole<00:00:59.789> step

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
step whole step half step whole step

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.910 
step whole step half step whole step
whole<00:01:01.590> step<00:01:01.670> whole<00:01:02.670> step<00:01:02.730> half<00:01:03.719> step<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.290> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
whole step whole step half step and I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
whole step whole step half step and I
could<00:01:05.100> start<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> formula<00:01:05.909> from<00:01:06.119> any<00:01:06.420> point

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
could start this formula from any point

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
could start this formula from any point
I<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.560> start<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.860> formula<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.490> C<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.150> could

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I could start this formula on C I could

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
I could start this formula on C I could
start<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.780> E<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.350> could<00:01:10.560> start<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.950> E<00:01:11.130> flat

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
start it on E I could start it on E flat

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
start it on E I could start it on E flat
I<00:01:11.820> could<00:01:12.000> start<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.360> G<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.320> doesn't<00:01:13.740> matter

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I could start it on G it doesn't matter

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730 
I could start it on G it doesn't matter
where<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> start<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.450> formula<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:16.229> always

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
where I start the formula will always

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
where I start the formula will always
stay<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> same<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> let's<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.200> what

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
stay the same so let's look at what

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
stay the same so let's look at what
happens<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> start<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.250> formula<00:01:20.640> from

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
happens when I start this formula from

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
happens when I start this formula from
the<00:01:20.970> note<00:01:21.119> C<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.900> C<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:23.070> D<00:01:23.220> whole<00:01:23.580> step<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the note C well C to D whole step that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
the note C well C to D whole step that
works<00:01:24.390> B<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> e<00:01:25.380> whole<00:01:25.950> step<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.580> works

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
works B to e whole step that works

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.359 
works B to e whole step that works
e<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.810> F<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.470> half<00:01:28.710> step<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.250> that's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
e to F is only a half step but that's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.069 
e to F is only a half step but that's
what<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.670> formula<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.119> calling<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
what my formula is calling for so that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.340 
what my formula is calling for so that
works<00:01:31.290> whole<00:01:32.250> step<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.850> lands<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.270> G<00:01:33.479> whole

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
works whole step that lands on G whole

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.690 
works whole step that lands on G whole
step<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.390> whole<00:01:36.390> step<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.930> B<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> half<00:01:38.400> step

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
step to a whole step to B and half step

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.899 
step to a whole step to B and half step
to<00:01:38.909> C<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.290> understand<00:01:40.920> why<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.220> piano

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to C so now we understand why the piano

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
to C so now we understand why the piano
is<00:01:42.090> laid<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:44.130> because

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
is laid out this way and it's because

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.940 
is laid out this way and it's because
the<00:01:44.700> scale<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.210> C<00:01:45.420> major<00:01:45.659> has<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.439> sharps<00:01:46.799> or

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the scale of C major has no sharps or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550 
the scale of C major has no sharps or
flats<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> designers<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> piano

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
flats and so the designers of the piano

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
flats and so the designers of the piano
thought<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.130> helpful<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> make<00:01:51.060> all

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
thought it would be helpful to make all

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
thought it would be helpful to make all
the<00:01:51.509> white<00:01:51.659> keys<00:01:51.899> merely<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.560> notes<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.979> C

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the white keys merely the notes of C

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.959 
the white keys merely the notes of C
major<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.270> non<00:01:54.450> sharp<00:01:54.899> non<00:01:55.200> flat<00:01:55.649> notes<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
major or the non sharp non flat notes so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
major or the non sharp non flat notes so
let's<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.540> happens<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> start<00:01:58.110> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
let's see what happens when I start this

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310 
let's see what happens when I start this
formula<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> note<00:01:59.579> beside<00:01:59.820> C<00:02:00.329> let's<00:02:01.049> start

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
formula on a note beside C let's start

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 
formula on a note beside C let's start
from<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> note<00:02:01.710> G<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.759> I'll<00:02:02.909> go<00:02:03.060> whole

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
from the note G and so I'll go whole

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.340 
from the note G and so I'll go whole
step<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.079> gets<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> whole<00:02:05.430> step<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.969> B<00:02:06.350> half

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
step that gets to a whole step to B half

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.070 
step that gets to a whole step to B half
step<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.069> C<00:02:08.750> whole<00:02:09.750> step<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.560> D<00:02:10.879> whole<00:02:11.879> step<00:02:12.239> two

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
step to C whole step to D whole step two

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
step to C whole step to D whole step two
and<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.800> my<00:02:13.980> formula<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.490> calling<00:02:14.850> for

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and now my formula is calling for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.880 
and now my formula is calling for
another<00:02:15.180> whole<00:02:15.450> step<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.500> distance

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
another whole step but the distance

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010 
another whole step but the distance
between<00:02:16.980> E<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.490> F<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.850> only<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.209> half<00:02:18.480> step<00:02:18.780> so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
between E and F is only a half step so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.320 
between E and F is only a half step so
to<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> whole<00:02:20.010> step<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.459> from<00:02:20.670> E<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:21.090> going

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to go a whole step up from E I'm going

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
to go a whole step up from E I'm going
to<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> go<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.350> Kees<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> that's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to have to go up to Kees and that's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.390 
to have to go up to Kees and that's
gonna<00:02:23.760> land<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> note<00:02:24.569> F<00:02:24.780> sharp<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.709> then

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
gonna land on the note F sharp and then

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.750 
gonna land on the note F sharp and then
I'm<00:02:26.520> gonna<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.850> half<00:02:27.150> step<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.870> G<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> notes

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I'm gonna go half step to G so the notes

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.400 
I'm gonna go half step to G so the notes
in<00:02:29.940> G<00:02:30.150> major<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.690> g<00:02:31.190> ABCDE<00:02:32.190> F<00:02:32.459> sharp<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.450> G<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
in G major are g ABCDE F sharp and G and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.160 
in G major are g ABCDE F sharp and G and
the<00:02:34.920> reason<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.640> F<00:02:35.940> sharp<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.510> because

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the reason I have F sharp is because

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
the reason I have F sharp is because
when<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> start<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.920> formula<00:02:38.430> whole<00:02:38.819> whole

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
when I start this formula whole whole

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.559 
when I start this formula whole whole
half<00:02:39.300> whole<00:02:39.600> whole<00:02:39.959> whole<00:02:40.200> half<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.739> G<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.910> have

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
half whole whole whole half on G I have

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.290 
half whole whole whole half on G I have
to<00:02:42.900> land<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.620> note<00:02:43.800> F<00:02:43.950> sharp<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.000> let's<00:02:45.180> do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
to land on the note F sharp so let's do

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.440 
to land on the note F sharp so let's do
one<00:02:45.480> more<00:02:45.630> let's<00:02:46.470> start<00:02:46.769> from<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> note<00:02:47.160> D

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
one more let's start from the note D

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.870 
one more let's start from the note D
I'll<00:02:48.450> go<00:02:48.660> D<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.050> e<00:02:49.080> whole<00:02:49.620> step<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> need

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
I'll go D to e whole step now I need

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.580 
I'll go D to e whole step now I need
another<00:02:50.910> whole<00:02:51.390> step<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:51.840> e<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.019> F<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.410> only<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
another whole step but e to F so only a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.000 
another whole step but e to F so only a
half<00:02:52.800> step<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.730> lands<00:02:54.060> me<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.420> f-sharp

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
half step so that lands me on f-sharp

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.590 
half step so that lands me on f-sharp
half<00:02:56.010> step<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.670> G<00:02:57.260> whole<00:02:58.260> step<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.600> whole

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
half step to G whole step to a whole

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.170 
half step to G whole step to a whole
step<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.350> B<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.800> now<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.459> need<00:03:02.700> another<00:03:02.970> whole

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
step to B and now I need another whole

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.270 
step to B and now I need another whole
step<00:03:03.390> here<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.840> B<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.470> C<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.680> only<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.010> half<00:03:05.250> step

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
step here and B to C is only a half step

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.170 
step here and B to C is only a half step
so<00:03:05.850> I'll<00:03:05.970> land<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.510> C<00:03:07.200> sharp<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.940> half

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so I'll land on C sharp and then half

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.620 
so I'll land on C sharp and then half
step<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.660> D<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:11.250> notes<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.580> D<00:03:11.760> major<00:03:11.940> are<00:03:12.300> de

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
step to D so the notes in D major are de

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
step to D so the notes in D major are de

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
got F sharp in C sharp is just by

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.100 
got F sharp in C sharp is just by
starting<00:03:19.320> my<00:03:19.560> major<00:03:19.860> scale<00:03:20.280> formula<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:21.000> D<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
starting my major scale formula on D I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.830 
starting my major scale formula on D I
had<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.890> play<00:03:23.100> those<00:03:23.310> Black<00:03:23.579> Keys<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.420> play<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
had to play those Black Keys to play the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.650 
had to play those Black Keys to play the
appropriate<00:03:25.380> set<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.100> distances<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.480> there

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
appropriate set of distances so there

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.240 
appropriate set of distances so there
are<00:03:27.780> 12<00:03:28.079> notes<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> music<00:03:29.070> which

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
are 12 notes in all the music which

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.910 
are 12 notes in all the music which
means<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:29.670> 12<00:03:30.150> possible<00:03:30.840> places<00:03:31.110> to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
means there are 12 possible places to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.580 
means there are 12 possible places to
