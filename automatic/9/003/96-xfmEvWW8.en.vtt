00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.150
 So from the description you can download the archive 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.170
 which will find a folder with the name 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.340

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.750
 so what is it well liberty city 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.719
 stories cheat device with its nature 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 This is taken into account. Of course, this is understandable. 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.649
 cheat device files and which are just 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.100
 binding without them nothing to work 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 folder will contain a chip 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 extra things like a liberty 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.649
 city ​​stories so for you city stories 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 that is, if you find any else 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 additionally cheats you want to install 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 go to the cheat folder right here in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.129
 root here in this folder fold for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.170
 liberty city stories 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 if you need for wai city so 100 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180

 here as you can see there are enough cheats here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 I think you basically have enough 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 bother with the installation 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.369
 more likely you do not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'll even have to throw it out 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.840
 extra but easier palm not to bother 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.450
 in general, that is , you see how many here 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 all sorts of different cheats I even many of them 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.950
 I have not tried it myself 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 well then let's start the installation 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 we return here we copy fellow travelers 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.810
 let's start with her 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.659
 go to the psp naturally in the root 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.260
 folder in advance to the same connect them and 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.650
 just paste in here 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.780
 without any hassle problems waiting for now 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 throw these four hundred and seventy one 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 element think in the next video we 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 let's talk about the main functions 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.380
 by the way there is also a Russian version 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.290
 device but I honestly got used to 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.780
 English so if you want 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.930
 still Russian che let's stand on his 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.670
 will already be found on the Internet because 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.830
 that but I do not want to spend time on it then 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.679
 that i just don't need and so 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.420
 back to the folder cheat device 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.670
 Now we are copying these two files. 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.250
 liberty city cost device and wai 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.980
 psp and see if you don’t have one 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.830
 this folder is called this plugin to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.610
 create if it is then just go 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.959
 and so here we insert our files not 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.780
 pay attention that i have so many 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.440
 various files and then ask me a lot 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.600
 plugins are worth it all copied 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.480
 now to make our cheat device work 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.540
 in the game we need to create if you have it 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.760

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.239

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.459
 document called gay we go in and here 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.600
 what we need 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.950
 line m with but: snooping plugin slash 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.190
 che liberty come on . 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.730
 rx and all the same for wai city cheat 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.370
 device 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.810
 these zeroes are basically not needed 0 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.299
 space separated plugin 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.180
 off units separated by a space 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.130
 the plugin included these lines you can 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.380
 find also in the description so you don’t 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.230
 bother remember that every new 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.720
 cheat on with a new line I'm when small 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.030
 I was thinking why can only 14 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.650
 restore how to do so 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.690
 because there could not be two in the same way 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.670
 text to document and create and then 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.160
 guessed just move the line counted 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.950
 themselves simply great genius Well 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.489
 when you did it you connect usb 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.799
 from the computer go to the recovery menu 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.840
 I remember I had a lot of questions on 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.350
 about how to enter recovery menu 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.130
 I do not know how to enter recovery menu and so on 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.620
 other other 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.500
 if your sands are stitched in recovery 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.970
 menu can be accessed 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.350
 easy way to completely disable psp 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.680
 that is, you clamp the switch same chizhov 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.870
 turning on until clamping near 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.100
 You pick up until the pussy 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.020
 won't shut off completely 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.880
 or if you can't do it 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.740
 You can simply pull out the battery and 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.590
 all well naturally back should in 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.690
 this moment recharge then when 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.560
 turn on clamping the right trigger then 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.010
 there is a button 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 p which is at the top of your psp and 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.660
 you get into the recovery menu 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.450
 here right at the time of switching on there 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.669
 find line plugin sense plugin 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.160
 combine correctly maybe you will 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.120
 written in Russian I do not know what you have 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.700
 recovery menu there find our liberty 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.180
 city ​​stories and weiss city is a device and 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.370
 choose the one I advise you to choose only 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.800
 one because when two work at once 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.320
 unfortunately somehow not very strange 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.350
 work so better anyway 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.550
 choose one here i always choose one 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.229
 I have now chosen liberty city stories 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.050
 teaches the device and 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.560
 I think now I will temporarily suspend 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.560
 record and maybe I won't do it 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.320
 let's go to my desktop there 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.660
 all and gosh damn how much I have 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.140
 too much 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:19.010
 so let's wait for the launch so 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.780
 you see liberty city stories start 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.730
 boot up now it will light up 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.210
 preservation and since it starts to treat 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.210
 device 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.660
 So 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.660
 almost 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.210
 so save everything booted now 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:47.150
 just waiting here he appeared beautiful 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.920
 the device is loaded to us 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.710
 disable you can click either 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.160
 and at the top lt the left trigger is 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.820
 to the left of the right trigger I am also at the top 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.650
 psp 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.770
 well, the up and down arrow is necessary 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.860
 same mother to choose 4 then 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.040
 there must be more up and down to sweat 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.830
 choose enable disable chip bring 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.120
 And so much lags okay like this 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.860
 also do to see compiled 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.890
 connect enable read differently on 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.760
 cross that is so 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.230
 then you can squander on the next sheet 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.060
 and 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.320
 in the very last sheet this here 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.730
 additional four they already 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:33.050
 left-right made a string file there : 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:36.140
 so here is the file: hear it rushing here 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.630
 there you are looking for your necessary cheat 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.070
 there is left right and again up down 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.220
 there may be several sheets like 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.490
 for example, it seems to me right here, yes, yes 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.320
 total accounts a lot believe every 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.650
 foot the file that I show you contains 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.000
 most likely not one more reader in 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.860
 next series we will deal with 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.260
 The main cheats that is this one 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.840
 I'll tell you the page and this one here 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.570
 page tell and mess 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.330
 I will say the same first two main ones 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.400
 page perhaps still wai city stores i 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.920
 tell the file trampling but it will be by 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.780
 wish for those who do not know trample it 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.660
 such file where are additional 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.850
 four which in my opinion 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.020
 definitely worth considering because 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.720
 there are such useful what are you 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.600
 infinite weapons sweat theme download 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.610
 ammo then absolutely everything in arms from 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.980
 you will have games that is, regardless of 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.060
 of him there are three mustaches there too 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.010
 will be all different 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.830
 then there ammo weapons too 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.900
 without reloading shooting than I think 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.430
 if you want to consider the file 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.710
 treading it will consider 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.720
 but for now that's all thanks to everyone for 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.240
