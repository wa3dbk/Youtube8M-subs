00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
people don't I personally think it's a

this<00:02:59.430> car<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.879> I<00:03:00.299> think<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.629> just<00:03:00.659> fits<00:03:01.230> it

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
this car and I think it just fits it

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.380 
this car and I think it just fits it
well<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.859> decided<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.640> go<00:03:02.879> with<00:03:02.909> coloured

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
well I decided not to go with coloured

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.349 
well I decided not to go with coloured
tire<00:03:03.629> smoke<00:03:04.019> because<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.739> like<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.760> couldn't

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
tire smoke because I like the I couldn't

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.479 
tire smoke because I like the I couldn't
like<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.750> realistic<00:03:07.230> tire<00:03:07.709> smoke<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.280> it

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
like the realistic tire smoke just it

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.119 
like the realistic tire smoke just it
looks<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.000> don't<00:03:09.750> know<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.900> looks<00:03:10.079> cooler<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.980> my

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
looks I don't know it looks cooler in my

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.009 
looks I don't know it looks cooler in my
opinion<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.299> again<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.629> depends<00:03:12.900> on

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
opinion but then again it depends on

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.149 
opinion but then again it depends on

other cars in the past now we're getting

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.339 
other cars in the past now we're getting
close<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.480> end<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.900> build<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.290> I

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
close to the end of the build and I

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.750 
close to the end of the build and I
think<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:49.680> starting<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.160> look<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.459> mean<00:03:50.579> while

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
think it's starting to look I mean while

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.509 
think it's starting to look I mean while
not<00:03:50.970> starting<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.690> does<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.620> looks<00:03:52.680> good

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
not starting it it does it looks good

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.250 
not starting it it does it looks good
I<00:03:53.549> would<00:03:54.209> honestly<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.660> would<00:03:54.930> drive<00:03:55.079> this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
I would honestly I would drive this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.020 
I would honestly I would drive this
thing<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.620> real<00:03:55.799> life<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.220> looks<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.760> looks

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
thing in real life it looks it looks

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.150 
thing in real life it looks it looks
beast<00:03:57.449> in<00:03:57.690> my<00:03:57.840> opinion<00:03:58.199> it<00:03:58.319> really<00:03:58.349> really

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
beast in my opinion it really really

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.390 
beast in my opinion it really really
really<00:03:59.579> does<00:03:59.970> now<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.440> get<00:04:01.620> an<00:04:01.889> idea<00:04:02.310> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
really does now just to get an idea of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.220 
really does now just to get an idea of
the<00:04:02.849> difference<00:04:03.239> between<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:03.959> cars

handling outside of slidy cars versus

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.099 
handling outside of slidy cars versus

forward<00:06:57.690> motion<00:06:58.440> which<00:06:59.070> I<00:06:59.490> I<00:06:59.940> don't<00:07:00.210> know<00:07:00.419> I

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
forward motion which I I don't know I

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.600 
forward motion which I I don't know I
hadn't<00:07:00.900> seen<00:07:01.230> that<00:07:01.260> happen<00:07:01.950> before<00:07:02.210> but<00:07:03.500> it's

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
hadn't seen that happen before but it's

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.860 
hadn't seen that happen before but it's
it's<00:07:05.610> just<00:07:05.730> one<00:07:06.060> of<00:07:06.150> those<00:07:06.240> little<00:07:06.389> weird

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
it's just one of those little weird

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.720 
it's just one of those little weird
things<00:07:07.350> that<00:07:07.620> you<00:07:07.680> kind<00:07:07.860> of<00:07:07.980> have<00:07:08.130> to<00:07:08.310> get<00:07:08.430> used

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
things that you kind of have to get used

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.900 
things that you kind of have to get used
to<00:07:08.940> with<00:07:09.870> this<00:07:10.020> car<00:07:10.320> because<00:07:10.680> honestly<00:07:11.070> the

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
to with this car because honestly the

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.409 
to with this car because honestly the
handling<00:07:12.450> is<00:07:12.630> really<00:07:13.080> odd<00:07:13.610> but<00:07:14.610> I<00:07:14.880> think<00:07:15.360> you

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
handling is really odd but I think you

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.030 
handling is really odd but I think you
could<00:07:15.600> get<00:07:15.780> used<00:07:16.050> to<00:07:16.200> it<00:07:16.320> honestly<00:07:16.590> I<00:07:16.919> think

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
could get used to it honestly I think

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.650 
could get used to it honestly I think
you<00:07:17.220> could<00:07:17.340> get<00:07:17.460> used<00:07:17.669> to<00:07:17.790> it<00:07:17.880> in<00:07:18.090> the<00:07:18.240> long<00:07:18.450> run

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
you could get used to it in the long run

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.030 
you could get used to it in the long run
it<00:07:18.810> was<00:07:18.900> easier<00:07:19.230> to<00:07:19.290> get<00:07:19.470> used<00:07:19.650> to<00:07:19.800> them<00:07:19.950> the

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 
it was easier to get used to them the

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.370 
it was easier to get used to them the
GTR<00:07:20.550> because<00:07:21.270> the<00:07:21.390> GTR<00:07:21.810> was<00:07:22.020> all<00:07:22.169> wheel<00:07:22.350> drive

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
GTR because the GTR was all wheel drive

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.240 
GTR because the GTR was all wheel drive
and<00:07:23.070> I'm<00:07:23.970> a<00:07:24.750> lot<00:07:25.260> better<00:07:25.470> with<00:07:25.950> rear-wheel

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
and I'm a lot better with rear-wheel

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.340 
and I'm a lot better with rear-wheel
drive<00:07:26.400> than<00:07:27.240> I<00:07:27.330> am<00:07:27.480> with<00:07:27.630> all-wheel<00:07:27.930> drive<00:07:28.169> the

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.350 
drive than I am with all-wheel drive the

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.290 
drive than I am with all-wheel drive the
only<00:07:28.590> thing<00:07:28.770> about<00:07:28.980> the<00:07:29.130> GTR<00:07:29.550> is<00:07:29.669> that<00:07:29.790> the<00:07:29.880> GTR

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
only thing about the GTR is that the GTR

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.990 
only thing about the GTR is that the GTR
was<00:07:30.510> a<00:07:30.540> lot<00:07:30.870> easier<00:07:30.900> -<00:07:31.680> it<00:07:32.580> was<00:07:32.729> a<00:07:32.760> lot<00:07:32.940> easier

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
was a lot easier - it was a lot easier

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.510 
was a lot easier - it was a lot easier
to<00:07:33.479> save<00:07:33.810> it<00:07:34.020> if<00:07:34.169> you<00:07:34.410> went<00:07:34.590> into<00:07:34.740> a<00:07:34.830> corner<00:07:35.280> too

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
to save it if you went into a corner too

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.060 
to save it if you went into a corner too
hard<00:07:35.850> this<00:07:36.540> manoeuvre<00:07:37.050> right<00:07:37.229> here<00:07:37.410> scared<00:07:37.830> me

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
hard this manoeuvre right here scared me

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.070 
hard this manoeuvre right here scared me
I<00:07:38.250> went<00:07:38.669> in<00:07:38.850> sideways<00:07:39.330> then<00:07:39.510> I<00:07:39.540> saw<00:07:39.750> this<00:07:39.870> boat

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
I went in sideways then I saw this boat

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.510 
I went in sideways then I saw this boat
trailer<00:07:40.410> coming<00:07:40.860> and<00:07:40.950> I<00:07:40.979> was<00:07:41.070> like<00:07:41.190> go<00:07:41.340> back

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
trailer coming and I was like go back

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.370 
trailer coming and I was like go back
the<00:07:41.669> other<00:07:41.700> way<00:07:41.910> and<00:07:42.240> so<00:07:42.810> I<00:07:42.840> went<00:07:43.110> back<00:07:43.260> the

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
the other way and so I went back the

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.900 
the other way and so I went back the
other<00:07:43.530> way<00:07:43.590> drifted<00:07:44.130> right<00:07:44.160> in<00:07:44.430> front<00:07:44.669> it<00:07:44.790> well

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910 
other way drifted right in front it well

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.909 
other way drifted right in front it well
and<00:07:45.510> I<00:07:45.720> really<00:07:45.870> drifted<00:07:46.410> but<00:07:46.530> kind<00:07:46.680> of<00:07:46.710> just

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 
and I really drifted but kind of just

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:49.460 
and I really drifted but kind of just
whipped<00:07:47.190> back<00:07:47.580> right<00:07:48.300> in<00:07:48.419> front<00:07:48.690> of<00:07:48.750> the<00:07:48.870> the

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470 
whipped back right in front of the the

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.990 
whipped back right in front of the the
truck<00:07:49.710> pulling<00:07:50.040> the<00:07:50.130> boat<00:07:50.310> trailer<00:07:50.669> so<00:07:50.820> it's<00:07:50.940> a

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
truck pulling the boat trailer so it's a

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.719 
truck pulling the boat trailer so it's a
