00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the Romans built I think it's a horrible

the Romans built I think it's a horrible
horrible<00:02:17.320> horrible<00:02:17.560> idea<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.370> have<00:02:18.490> to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
horrible horrible idea you have to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330 
horrible horrible idea you have to
remember<00:02:18.730> something<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.150> DNA<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:21.220> all

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
remember something in DNA even with all

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.040 
remember something in DNA even with all
these<00:02:21.460> new<00:02:21.640> WB<00:02:22.090> people<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.660> they've<00:02:22.780> brought

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
these new WB people that they've brought

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.930 
these new WB people that they've brought
in<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.620> been<00:02:23.800> definitely<00:02:24.130> cast<00:02:24.640> offs

or whatever you want to call them has

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.410 
or whatever you want to call them has
always<00:02:27.850> been<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.690> alternative<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:30.180> WWE<00:02:31.180> in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
always been the alternative to WWE in

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.010 
always been the alternative to WWE in
terms<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.670> they<00:02:33.670> would<00:02:33.790> present<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.570> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
terms of they would present the the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.770 
terms of they would present the the
wrestling<00:02:35.500> more<00:02:35.920> wrestling<00:02:36.490> than<00:02:36.820> sports

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
wrestling more wrestling than sports

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.070 
wrestling more wrestling than sports
entertainment<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.470> they've<00:02:38.940> drastically

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
entertainment and they've drastically

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.780 
entertainment and they've drastically
gone<00:02:41.080> away<00:02:41.380> from<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:41.950> recent<00:02:42.160> years<00:02:42.580> but

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
gone away from that in recent years but

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.910 
gone away from that in recent years but
I<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.210> by<00:02:43.540> having<00:02:43.750> Hulk<00:02:44.230> Hogan

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
I think by having Hulk Hogan

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.940 
I think by having Hulk Hogan
that's<00:02:45.180> 59<00:02:46.180> or<00:02:46.390> 60<00:02:46.420> years<00:02:46.870> old<00:02:47.020> become<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> TNA

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that's 59 or 60 years old become the TNA

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.460 
that's 59 or 60 years old become the TNA
world<00:02:48.190> champion<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:49.180> bad<00:02:49.660> idea

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
world champion is a bad idea

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.530 
world champion is a bad idea
the<00:02:50.830> only<00:02:51.430> way<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.640> could<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.210> being<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the only way I could see that being a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.340 
the only way I could see that being a
possibly<00:02:53.050> good<00:02:53.290> idea<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.980> if<00:02:54.600> somebody<00:02:55.600> who

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
possibly good idea is if somebody who

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.530 
possibly good idea is if somebody who
deserves<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.280> champion<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:57.970> beats<00:02:58.330> him

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
deserves to be champion that beats him

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.180 
deserves to be champion that beats him
