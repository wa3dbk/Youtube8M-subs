00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello live bike we are in malo in 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.059
 province of vicenza we are at the bike park 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.269
 ride ipad team andrè then let's go to 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.010
 see together who wanted and created 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.010
 this reality hello 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.570
 who are you emanuele to role 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.340
 paolo gasparella from what you know 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.920
 six years ago in a dh competition for six years 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.829
 and we saw each other for the first time in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.910
 a downing race where you live one of 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.519
 next to each other 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.199
 next to his house and why not there 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.510
 you are known before because the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.980
 bicycle unites because the life of 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.150
 experiences have led us to do 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.010
 different paths 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.570
 I have a wish in the mountains for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.850
 snowboarding because I really liked the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.980
 mountain but a bicycle race 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.590
 precisely of dhi and then we met 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.289
 and from there all this is born is an honor 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.440
 he tries to give as much as possible 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:14.860
 to others at the expense of himself who 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.340
 it is as good as a piece of bread and a 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.470
 too precise disorderly defect 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.430
 too precise but really junior first 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.190
 once by bike 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 my parents didn't leave me then 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.360
 never leave home 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.820
 consequently I was looking for all the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.549
 possible tricks to leave 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.590
 choirs and discoveries of the outside world with 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.110
 my dad who bought me a bike 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.450
 from the street and thought to let me pedal 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.270
 on the street and rome the tips and then in 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.900
 actually I attached the nail a little and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.490
 a friend of mine 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.619
 he later loaned me from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 drop-down bicycles of shock absorbers 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.500
 a world has opened up to me 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.530
 where the idea of ​​the bike park comes from 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.680
 we discovered traveling abroad that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.119
 all the other kids that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.549
 they ride a bike have some 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.140
 technique as a result we said 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.140
 because we make them we too 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.209
 building a track under the house is born 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.400
 to make up for the lack of technique 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.380
 by cuts absence of structures here in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.150
 italy we going to austria to turn 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 we noticed that the boys on 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.480
 they had another type of technique, six 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.410
 proud to live in italy 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 in Italy there are 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.820
 of the beautiful places of the beautiful 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.150
 mountains but certainly do not come 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.640
 exploited we would like starting from this 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.920
 park try to grow the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.020
 bicycle movement to give 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.540
 possibility to all the other boys and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.940
 children to use these magnificent places 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860
 learning to ride a bike from here to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.660
 then pass the mountains around here 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.510
 I would like to be more proud to live 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 italy and i'm trying to develop 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.330
 new areas to make this place more 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.740
 livable for a better lifestyle 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.740
 the fastest British 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.790
 I know the dice view cart him 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.710
 typical day bike my day 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.330
 type indexes begins the day before 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.250
 calling a lot of friends 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.780
 a day of raid in the mountains studio 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.360
 you always do it with a friend for whom the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.790
 right people always find it start 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.890
 to shoot as soon as possible and continue 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 until evening without ever stopping either 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 eat what you would do with a million 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280
 EUR 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.390
 on the top in bulldozers truck and half i 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.620
 land build a pump in each 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.830
 municipality of italy 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.360
 greet me with each other sharia e 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.080
 giving me now we will see then on track a 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.830
 ray da ciao go near by bike 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.830
 see you soon 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.629
 Which 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 mum 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.570
 he did it 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.570
 she 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.530
 Pope 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.530
 Go 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.180
 well guys here we are starting from 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.660
 street area of ​​the bike park and then see 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.040
 all together with lele and paolo 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.520
 sections of the park and start from the area 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.220
 street meanwhile where are the two cuartero 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.220
 a mini is an area with structures 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.440
 some banks here definitely learn to 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.390
 develop downhill paths 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.790
 also because if they have postponements and 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.780
 enter that certainly freeride yes 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.640
 they find 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.050
 here's where to learn when you plan on 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.450
 safety with a helmet and everything 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.420
 as soon as you go out and where they are 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.890
 these paths are intertwined 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.520
 referrals I find we know how 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.520
 to approach 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.840
 here we are in the first part of the park 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.760
 pump track track you want things 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.160
 say good track by the actress 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.530
 give the word itself pumping pumping 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.840
 gives us the idea of ​​how to have it 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.280
 propulsion without pedal areas and le 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.560
 stands to go away that 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.000
 bicycle because it gives you data posture 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.410
 gives the possibility to understand well that 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.020
 what is a curve without in which a 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.030
 support because having answered if 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.400
 just went from propulsion through 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.160
 pumping and pushing in the bank 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.100
 then the parabolic substantially ti 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.630
 helps speed up exactly like all 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.030
 the rest of the track is not here 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.910
 never ride the sense is the pump 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.560
 track a translated pumping path 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.780
 in Italian it is bad to say but it is 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.210
 you just pump those with your arms 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.900
 legs therefore all a matter of 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.780
 exact speed an exact and above all 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.720
 of dexterity and stability and of 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.850
 coordination and reflexes why not 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.440
 it actually goes away so strong 10 15 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.820
 then you are protected with a helmet 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.210
 knee pads protection 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.780
 gloves however teaches you just to 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.780
 be swift at one with the bike due 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.620
 to cloud says great here we are in 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.450
 jump and dirt area well this is the 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.640
 I continue the natural pampa from here 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.480
 we are launched first increase of the 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.190
 speed 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.380
 increase the size of the jump 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.090
 increase heights increases the time in 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.730
 air available and therefore there is the 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.150
 possibility to do some tricks some 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.130
 numbers 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.800
 so let's say data anyway 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.360
 always from the safety derived from the 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.390
 use of the pampas first because 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.430
 let's remember that pump is not already there 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.520
 little without palm because you only do 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.850
 we see badly the part dedicated to 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.500
 slope style now you're that in reality 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.870
 it simply means volumes always 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.460
 bigger and a little more structures 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.980
 details can be seen perhaps 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.560
 little house where we are a floor above and 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.260
 leila the future catwalk that you must 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.060
 build the slope bars here in wood 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.560
 style is nothing more than the continuation 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.400
 natural that if it had before the pampa 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.280
 by the giampà alert until oslo jumps 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.830
 bigger and bigger by bike park and ride 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.830
