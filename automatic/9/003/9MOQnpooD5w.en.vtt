00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.570
 a playing field for the recipe and more 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.119
 my name is hendrik nice the iw 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.240
 have turned on product as we do today 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.890
 again from martin merk maybe 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.800
 marketing is a bit my name 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.619
 become a favorite protein supplier or 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.349
 supplementary supplier of proteins to 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.419
 a huge selection of products 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.220
 Products taste delicious and that 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.699
 Value for money is right there 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.070
 easy cani sample I have hydro here 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.869
 This is isolated in meat products 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 Pure hydrolysis triggers beef 

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:44.619
 protein in the family 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.580
 taste that I have 

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:50.799
 still in there aroma most central of the 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.309
 Medium I think that added to that 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.019
 Will that be bad then something 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.170
 becomes more viscous and more to the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.559
 shakes for example with whey protein 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.600
 or with k in protein 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.189
 then comes is still sweetener 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.840
 Martina loves to be in it so klose 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.270
 I have the reference product here 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.400
 By the way, impaq whey protein in the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.540
 Tasting white chocolate real 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.210
 Delicious when you open the pack of 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.010
 cani pro is already another 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.909
 smell against the power of 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.100
 protein powder otherwise does not know the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.040
 reminds a little hermann Kuhl 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 and I do not know why 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 at the first moment I thought too 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.380
 beef proteins with 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.970
 Vanilla taste sounds only one 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 a bit strange but it can 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.530
 actually taste 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.240
 we want to shake that up now I have 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 measured here a scoop and 200 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 milliliters of water 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 Let's see how it dissolves 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.380
 So even with the weird mac 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.960
 is different than, for example, the whey 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.820
 protein a bit and donated it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.220
 form small groups I believe it can 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.740
 one does not see in the camera but one 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 has to give it longer than 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.760
 other proteins is not great 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.760
 soluble 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.050
 so at some point 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.050
 that has really dissolved 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.100
 nice creamy consistency 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.490
 Here you can see that it is right 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:03:04.350
 thick I try it this way are things 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:06.420
 made of cream I look quite good 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.270
 taste surprisingly at first 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.530
 for me because the user profile and far away 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.600
 I could not me only so 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.250
 imagine 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.200
 but since we are here now 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.350
 Reference product have the impaq 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.090
 You just have to say break that is 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.600
 better there 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.989
 that's just better in terms of taste 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.300
 compare the nutrition the cani 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.630
 pro has a bca share so the 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.970
 make amino acids yes one 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.700
 important role among others in the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.660
 play protein synthesis in the muscle and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.549
 also other important tasks 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:52.290
 The cani pro has 8,6 percent 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.110
 the impaq is 22.9 percent essential 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.660
 amino acids bca it too count 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.430
 So the amino acid is the body of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:07.739
 Outside are needed in cani pro 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.920
 19 2% and here almost 50% 47 5 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.920
 percent 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.609
 since that does not close as well as 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.850
 The luggage way is advantage while cani pro 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.140
 that is lactose free if you have one 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.700
 lactose intolerance has come on ska 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.820
 Of course , there is also a level of understanding 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.640
 other alternatives such as 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.210
 But soy protein provides for that 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.300
 We also impaq a bit 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.979
 fight price mp3 tasteless tastes 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.710
 15 euro 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:46.409
 49 kg per taste-neutral costs 18 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:50.159
 euro 29 but here 54 90 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:53.909
 a gram of protein phonak act in the mpeg 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.469
 Only 78% of a protein is always there 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.779
 a bit difficult because the give 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.879
 often also the protein content in the 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:03.869
 dry matter so the protein content 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.309
 if all water was withdrawn what yes 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.499
 not the case is what for example 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.419
 In the cheese I also find it irritated 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:12.199
 that in dry matter the fat content 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.199
 is entered 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:20.369
 converted to the 100 grams price 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:22.589
 the cani powder costs 1 eur 94 in the 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:25.489
 tasteless variant and that 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:30.229
 here a eur 890 tasteless 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:30.229
 parried passengers per front 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.949
 Finally one can say quite one 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:41.399
 book tasting protein but not too 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.749
 compare the middle mcveigh I will 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.429
 stay with the integrated 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.110
 I hope I was able to help you with this 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:47.699
 give a little insight and video 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.029
 you in your upcoming 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.499
 support buying decisions 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.610
 and you turn on again next time 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:55.610
 until then your hendrik
