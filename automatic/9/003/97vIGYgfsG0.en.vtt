00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
especially because these things are so

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
especially because these things are so
heavy<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> ship<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.320> around<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
heavy that when you ship them around it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
heavy that when you ship them around it
would<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> disaster<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.680> know

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
would be a disaster if they you know

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
would be a disaster if they you know

because<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:44.260> actually<00:02:44.980> will<00:02:45.130> prevent<00:02:45.430> power

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
because it actually will prevent power

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.730 
because it actually will prevent power
surges<00:02:45.940> from<00:02:46.060> frying<00:02:46.480> your<00:02:46.630> phone<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:47.440> theory

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
power does actually go through the phone

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.160 
power does actually go through the phone
line<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.860> there<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.040> go<00:02:51.450> alright<00:02:52.450> ups

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
this UPS I would put it but there you go

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.730 
this UPS I would put it but there you go
okay<00:05:35.669> so<00:05:36.090> rj45<00:05:36.990> slash<00:05:37.680> RJ<00:05:38.190> RJ<00:05:39.090> 11<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.560> out

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
okay so rj45 slash RJ RJ 11 in and out

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.280 
okay so rj45 slash RJ RJ 11 in and out
so<00:05:40.919> you<00:05:40.979> can<00:05:41.190> either<00:05:41.460> power<00:05:42.450> surge<00:05:42.810> protect

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
so you can either power surge protect

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.090 
so you can either power surge protect
your<00:05:43.440> Ethernet<00:05:43.860> or<00:05:44.100> your<00:05:45.470> phone<00:05:46.470> line<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:47.070> I

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
your Ethernet or your phone line but I

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.740 
your Ethernet or your phone line but I
don't<00:05:47.370> really<00:05:47.490> see<00:05:47.729> any<00:05:47.880> reason<00:05:47.910> why<00:05:48.360> you

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
don't really see any reason why you

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.719 
don't really see any reason why you
would<00:05:49.050> want<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.320> surge<00:05:49.770> protect<00:05:50.190> Ethernet

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
would want to surge protect Ethernet

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.620 
would want to surge protect Ethernet
unless<00:05:52.460> yeah<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.490> can't<00:05:53.940> really<00:05:54.180> think<00:05:54.390> of<00:05:54.540> a

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
unless yeah I can't really think of a

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.760 
unless yeah I can't really think of a
reason<00:05:54.780> for<00:05:54.930> that<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.440> phone<00:05:55.560> lines

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
reason for that so the phone lines

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.100 
reason for that so the phone lines
probably<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.160> more<00:05:56.340> relevant<00:05:56.850> one<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.540> I

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
probably the more relevant one and I

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.900 
probably the more relevant one and I
think<00:05:58.500> that<00:05:58.710> pretty<00:05:58.950> much<00:05:59.120> covers<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:01.910> don't

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
think that pretty much covers it don't

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.940 
think that pretty much covers it don't
forget<00:06:03.180> guys<00:06:03.360> lots<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.440> things<00:06:04.620> can<00:06:04.800> go<00:06:04.919> wrong

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
forget guys lots of things can go wrong

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.860 
forget guys lots of things can go wrong
especially<00:06:05.490> when<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.300> power<00:06:06.450> goes<00:06:06.540> out

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
especially when the power goes out

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.320 
especially when the power goes out
whether<00:06:07.169> you're<00:06:07.410> flashing<00:06:07.950> a<00:06:08.190> BIOS<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:08.880> know

whether you're flashing a BIOS you know

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.360 
whether you're flashing a BIOS you know

updating any particular firmware you

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.040 
updating any particular firmware you

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
should always be plugged into a UPS

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.690 
should always be plugged into a UPS
because<00:06:13.350> it'll<00:06:13.650> buy<00:06:13.770> you<00:06:13.830> at<00:06:14.070> least<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.520> few

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.100 
room when we were flashing a BIOS once
and<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.370> only<00:06:26.760> reason<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.360> don't<00:06:27.810> know<00:06:27.900> if<00:06:27.990> that

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
and the only reason I don't know if that

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.500 
and the only reason I don't know if that
board's<00:06:28.470> handy<00:06:29.070> or<00:06:29.130> anything

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
board's handy or anything

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.180 
board's handy or anything
the<00:06:29.630> only<00:06:29.840> reason<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.350> board<00:06:30.710> didn't<00:06:30.980> brick

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
the only reason that board didn't brick

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.010 
the only reason that board didn't brick
was<00:06:31.580> because<00:06:31.880> it<00:06:32.030> had<00:06:32.120> a<00:06:32.150> dual<00:06:32.450> BIOS<00:06:32.690> feature

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
was because it had a dual BIOS feature

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.450 
was because it had a dual BIOS feature
that<00:06:33.230> had<00:06:33.410> a<00:06:33.440> hardware<00:06:33.770> switch<00:06:34.010> we<00:06:34.310> were<00:06:34.400> able

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
that had a hardware switch we were able

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.920 
that had a hardware switch we were able
to<00:06:34.580> just<00:06:34.730> switch<00:06:35.000> over<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.240> the<00:06:35.420> other<00:06:35.510> BIOS

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
to just switch over to the other BIOS

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.810 
to just switch over to the other BIOS
and<00:06:36.080> flash<00:06:36.290> that<00:06:36.530> one<00:06:36.680> once<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.430> power<00:06:37.610> came

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
and flash that one once the power came

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.060 
and flash that one once the power came
back<00:06:37.850> on<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:38.450> UPS's<00:06:38.870> can<00:06:39.140> save<00:06:39.350> your<00:06:39.470> bacon<00:06:39.590> I'm
