00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.940
 to make a fried fish 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 we have to make an Italian fry 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 for frying the Italian means one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 omelette in white or past 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.869
 only in flour to fix the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.630
 flour on the fish we're going to pass the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.660
 test before putting oil in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.489
 the passage inside water and ice 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.170
 it will be very fast 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.390
 the passage in water and ice serves to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.660
 therefore fix fishmeal not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.629
 disperse it in the oil to keep the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.190
 very crunchy fish and very clear of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 fish color was previously 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.640
 clean eviscerated exclaimed remains 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.640
 the head and tail of all fish 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.860
 We float properly and float more than 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.100
 one at a time in such a way that later 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.050
 we will be very quick to put two or 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.619
 three together to fry to see if 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.810
 the oil is at the right temperature 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.020
 let's put a pinch of flour 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.420
 I try in the center of our pan if 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.720
 we see that the flour remains free 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 unique and tends to precipitate 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.550
 then the oil is hot if instead from 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.220
 flour tends to spread and go 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.780
 towards the edge of the pan the oil does not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.080
 has still reached the temperature or 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.840
 luck ok then let's start with the first one 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.840
 fish the first step to that ice 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.670
 we will understand when the fish is ready 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.300
 when you are going to create bubbles 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 very small above the oil 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.160
 bubble is very large and still stands 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.160
 afflicting all the outside water 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.840
 how do you see the fish left a lot 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.840
 white and very crunchy 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.580
 we make a small decoration on the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.580
 plate using lemon leaves 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.760
 we've already put paper underneath 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.760
 straw 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.350
 after that we go to support the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.350
 our fish 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.610
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.630
 in our pro fry
