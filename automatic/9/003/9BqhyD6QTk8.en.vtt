my my first try my full first try here
for<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.059> guys<00:01:05.089> because<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.750> was<00:01:05.869> pretty<00:01:06.080> silly

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
for you guys because it was pretty silly

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.350 
for you guys because it was pretty silly
I<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:10.220> was<00:01:10.369> actually<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.700> pretty<00:01:10.850> good<00:01:11.090> run<00:01:11.330> for

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
I it was actually a pretty good run for

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920 
I it was actually a pretty good run for
me<00:01:11.690> doing<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.110> for<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.410> first<00:01:12.560> time<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.729> was<00:01:14.450> I

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
me doing this for the first time I was I

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.870 
me doing this for the first time I was I
was<00:01:15.470> pretty<00:01:15.590> happy<00:01:15.770> with<00:01:16.039> myself<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.729> I

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
was pretty happy with myself and I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.339 
was pretty happy with myself and I
thought<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.300> I<00:01:17.360> actually<00:01:17.539> might<00:01:17.869> do<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.170> in

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:18.349 
thought that I actually might do this in

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.730 
thought that I actually might do this in
one<00:01:18.500> try<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.450> did<00:01:21.170> something<00:01:21.410> really

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
one try but I did something really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.070 
one try but I did something really
stupid

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
one but yeah so anyways long jumping
through<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:49.550> really<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:51.050> way<00:02:51.200> to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
through this is really a good way to

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.840 
through this is really a good way to
save<00:02:51.500> time<00:02:51.530> don't<00:02:52.040> even<00:02:52.250> bother<00:02:52.430> like

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
save time don't even bother like

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.360 
save time don't even bother like
stopping<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.570> trying<00:02:53.870> did<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.140> time<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.800> mean

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
stopping and trying did I time it I mean

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.310 
stopping and trying did I time it I mean
the<00:02:55.489> worst<00:02:55.670> case<00:02:55.880> scenario<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.080> like

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
the worst case scenario is is you like

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.160 
the worst case scenario is is you like
hit<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.680> lava<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.390> do<00:02:59.570> then<00:02:59.870> he<00:02:59.989> just

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
hit the lava and if you do then he just

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.750 
hit the lava and if you do then he just
kind<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.440> burns<00:03:00.650> himself<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:01.310> he<00:03:01.340> jumps

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
kind of burns himself and then he jumps

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.310 
kind of burns himself and then he jumps
like<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.540> actually<00:03:02.810> okay<00:03:03.110> because

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
like that and it's actually okay because

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.740 
like that and it's actually okay because
it<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:04.190> makes<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.700> fast<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.600> not

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
it that makes you go fast so it's not

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.780 
it that makes you go fast so it's not
really<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.019> big<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.440> deal<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:06.980> don't<00:03:07.610> wait

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
really that big of a deal so don't wait

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.110 
really that big of a deal so don't wait
and<00:03:08.000> try<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and try and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.089 
and try and
that<00:03:09.269> just<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:10.049> long<00:03:10.349> jump<00:03:10.650> through<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.980> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
that just just long jump through it and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.399 
that just just long jump through it and
if<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> hit<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> lava<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:12.090> whatever<00:03:12.390> grab<00:03:13.379> a

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
if you hit the lava then whatever grab a

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.630 
if you hit the lava then whatever grab a
coin<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.950> you'll<00:03:14.099> be<00:03:14.220> fine

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
coin and you'll be fine

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.520 
coin and you'll be fine
here<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.390> long<00:03:15.599> jump<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.379> would

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
here you can long jump and if I would

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.990 
here you can long jump and if I would
have<00:03:16.650> done<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.950> right<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.190> had<00:03:17.549> done<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.879> right

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
have done that right I had done it right

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
have done that right I had done it right
previously<00:03:18.659> on<00:03:19.110> all<00:03:19.349> my<00:03:19.470> other<00:03:19.620> attempts<00:03:20.159> but

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
previously on all my other attempts but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.250 
previously on all my other attempts but
if<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.610> do<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.879> right<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.659> you'll<00:03:21.840> make<00:03:22.019> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
if you do it right then you'll make it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.020 
if you do it right then you'll make it
and<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> won't<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.950> go<00:03:23.069> on<00:03:23.280> those<00:03:23.489> guys

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
and you won't have to go on those guys

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.460 
and you won't have to go on those guys
at<00:03:24.269> all<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.599> ding<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.019> forget<00:03:25.260> their<00:03:25.440> names

funny name anyway so you could totally
avoid<00:03:37.110> them<00:03:37.379> by<00:03:37.769> long<00:03:38.700> jumping<00:03:39.209> through<00:03:39.450> that

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
avoid them by long jumping through that

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.690 
avoid them by long jumping through that
area<00:03:39.900> which<00:03:40.079> is<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.319> helpful<00:03:40.650> here<00:03:41.310> yes

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700

I'm doing backflips because I'm happy no

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.509 
I'm doing backflips because I'm happy no
because<00:03:45.569> I'm<00:03:45.810> trying<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.349> long<00:03:46.530> jump<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.430> you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
because I'm trying the long jump if you

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.220 
because I'm trying the long jump if you
long<00:03:47.790> jump<00:03:48.090> there<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.599> save<00:03:48.810> some<00:03:49.019> time

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
long jump there you can save some time

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.339 
long jump there you can save some time
but<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.560> whatever<00:03:49.709> reason<00:03:49.890> my<00:03:50.720> my<00:03:51.720> long<00:03:52.049> jump

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
but for whatever reason my my long jump

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.750 
but for whatever reason my my long jump
was<00:03:52.440> malfunctioning<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.640> ever

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
was malfunctioning and if you ever

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.190 
was malfunctioning and if you ever
wanted<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> know<00:03:54.180> what<00:03:54.390> happens<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.900> land

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
wanted to know what happens if you land

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.110 
wanted to know what happens if you land
on<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:55.409> of<00:03:55.470> those<00:03:55.739> while<00:03:56.700> they're<00:03:56.879> spinning

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
on one of those while they're spinning

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.420 
on one of those while they're spinning
you<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.019> saw<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.379> just<00:03:58.590> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:59.069> flips

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
you just saw it just kind of like flips

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.759 
you just saw it just kind of like flips
you<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.359> if<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.629> like<00:04:00.810> jump<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.290> spin<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
you up so if you like jump and spin you

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.899 
you up so if you like jump and spin you
can<00:04:01.799> kind<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:04.129> recover<00:04:05.129> from<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.790> again

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
can kind of recover from that so again

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.250 
can kind of recover from that so again
you<00:04:06.150> don't<00:04:06.239> really<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.720> wait<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.140> them

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you don't really have to wait for them

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.199 
you don't really have to wait for them
you<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.280> jump<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:08.670> them<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.940> if<00:04:09.030> they're

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
you can just jump on them and if they're

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030 
you can just jump on them and if they're
spinning<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.019> jump<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.349> spin<00:04:10.560> again

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
spinning then just jump and spin again

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.610 
spinning then just jump and spin again
here<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.329> part<00:04:12.629> of<00:04:12.810> course<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.230> kind<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.470> do

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
here this part of course you kind of do

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.440 
here this part of course you kind of do
have<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.980> wait<00:04:14.190> there's<00:04:14.760> no<00:04:14.910> real<00:04:15.090> way<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.269> get

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
have to wait there's no real way to get

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.550 
have to wait there's no real way to get
around<00:04:15.540> these<00:04:15.780> guys<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.229> don't<00:04:16.410> bother

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
around these guys but don't bother

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560 
around these guys but don't bother
killing<00:04:16.859> them<00:04:17.130> or<00:04:17.220> anything<00:04:17.370> just<00:04:17.789> wait<00:04:18.450> for

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
killing them or anything just wait for

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.930 
killing them or anything just wait for
them<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:19.349> like<00:04:19.979> walk<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.549> them<00:04:20.700> so

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
falling before that grab it the gravity

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.820 
falling before that grab it the gravity
pull<00:04:39.940> whatever<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.509> is<00:04:40.690> showed<00:04:40.960> up<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.669> I

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
said but yeah you could jump on those

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.170 
said but yeah you could jump on those
guys<00:04:49.419> heads<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.860> they<00:04:51.009> won't<00:04:51.190> hurt<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.030> if

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
guys heads but they won't hurt you so if

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.120 
guys heads but they won't hurt you so if
you<00:04:52.300> need<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.479> get<00:04:52.720> through<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:53.080> clicker<00:04:53.380> you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
you need to get through that clicker you

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.490 
you need to get through that clicker you
can<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:54.729> jump<00:04:54.880> on<00:04:55.030> their<00:04:55.180> heads<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:56.349> don't

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
can just jump on their heads you don't

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.839 
can just jump on their heads you don't
have<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.710> get<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:56.979> life<00:04:57.160> mushroom<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:57.729> the

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
have to get this life mushroom but the

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.460 
have to get this life mushroom but the
easiest<00:04:58.120> way<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.360> get<00:04:58.509> past<00:04:58.780> these<00:04:58.930> fire<00:04:59.199> bars

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
easiest way to get past these fire bars

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.159 
easiest way to get past these fire bars
is<00:04:59.740> to<00:05:00.009> jump<00:05:00.849> on<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.659> grab<00:05:02.110> it

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
is to jump on that so just grab it

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.710 
is to jump on that so just grab it
anyways<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:04.030> this<00:05:04.210> last<00:05:04.449> stretch<00:05:04.659> is

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
anyways and this last stretch is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.770 
anyways and this last stretch is
probably<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.319> closest<00:05:05.770> stretch<00:05:06.190> because

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
probably the closest stretch because

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.689 
probably the closest stretch because
there's<00:05:07.780> only<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.229> more<00:05:08.440> clock<00:05:08.860> left<00:05:09.280> and

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
there's only one more clock left and

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.360 
there's only one more clock left and
it's<00:05:10.060> pretty<00:05:10.479> tight<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.830> part<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.250> do

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
it's pretty tight and this part you do

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.890 
it's pretty tight and this part you do
have<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.639> pretty<00:05:12.819> careful<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.509> you<00:05:13.750> don't

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
have to be pretty careful with you don't

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.559 
have to be pretty careful with you don't

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
want to course get hit by this stuff so

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.600 
want to course get hit by this stuff so
spend<00:05:19.569> jumping<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.860> kind<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.280> staying

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
spend jumping and kind of staying

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.210 
spend jumping and kind of staying
towards<00:05:22.090> them<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.479> back<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:23.020> you<00:05:23.860> know<00:05:23.979> so<00:05:24.130> you
