00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
it's got about a five point two training

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.109 
it's got about a five point two training
which<00:01:12.619> obviously<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.950> good<00:01:14.280> by<00:01:14.490> any<00:01:14.640> standard

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
which obviously is good by any standard

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
which obviously is good by any standard
but<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> racing<00:01:16.830> tires<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but if you get the racing tires on there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.359 
but if you get the racing tires on there
and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> drop<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> suspension<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.740> if

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and you drop the suspension if you if

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
and you drop the suspension if you if
you<00:01:20.549> mess<00:01:20.909> around<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> tuning<00:01:21.780> settings

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you mess around with the tuning settings

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
you mess around with the tuning settings
I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.979> car<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
I think this car is going to be one of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
I think this car is going to be one of
the<00:01:24.450> cars<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.200> approach<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the cars that can really approach the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.070 
the cars that can really approach the
top<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> tracks<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> how

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
top on a lot of tracks because of how

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.390 
top on a lot of tracks because of how
much<00:01:28.229> power<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> has<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.009> relatively

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
much power it has and how relatively

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
much power it has and how relatively
light<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.479> waits<00:01:30.659> three<00:01:30.810> thousand<00:01:31.290> two

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
light it is it waits three thousand two

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.670 
light it is it waits three thousand two

finally<00:01:48.090> ringing<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> car<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> I've<00:01:48.990> been

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
finally ringing the car that I've been

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.929 
finally ringing the car that I've been
waiting<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.649> whole<00:01:49.829> time<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.189> least<00:01:50.310> but

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
waiting for this whole time at least but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.270 
waiting for this whole time at least but
anyway<00:01:51.210> naturally<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.649> compare<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
anyway naturally I have to compare it to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.550 
anyway naturally I have to compare it to
the<00:01:53.369> Dodge<00:01:53.549> Viper<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:54.960> rivals<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
the Dodge Viper if they are rivals and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.980 
the Dodge Viper if they are rivals and
I<00:01:56.619> mean<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.579> stats<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.270> Dodge<00:01:58.450> Viper<00:01:58.689> is

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
I mean on stats the Dodge Viper is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.170 
I mean on stats the Dodge Viper is
better<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.409> has<00:01:59.470> 640<00:02:00.399> horsepower<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
better it has 640 horsepower to the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.350 
better it has 640 horsepower to the
Corvette's<00:02:01.750> 460<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.399> little<00:02:03.850> bit<00:02:03.939> heavier

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
Corvette's 460 is a little bit heavier

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.760 
Corvette's 460 is a little bit heavier
but<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:04.689> got<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.850> 68.4<00:02:06.850> litre<00:02:07.349> v10<00:02:08.349> which<00:02:08.410> is

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
but it's got the 68.4 litre v10 which is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.710 
but it's got the 68.4 litre v10 which is
the<00:02:08.950> biggest<00:02:09.280> production<00:02:09.970> v10<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.599> they

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the biggest production v10 that they

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.490 
the biggest production v10 that they
make<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:13.000> also<00:02:13.209> got<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.720> slightly<00:02:14.260> better

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
make and it's also got a slightly better

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.880 
make and it's also got a slightly better
handling<00:02:15.040> statistics<00:02:15.790> why<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:16.989> car<00:02:17.290> has<00:02:17.530> 50

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
handling statistics why this car has 50

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.089

extra<00:02:18.280> points<00:02:18.819> on<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.989> on<00:02:20.200> forces<00:02:20.709> rating

extra points on the on forces rating

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.490 
extra points on the on forces rating
scale<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> midday<00:02:22.390> class<00:02:22.900> enough<00:02:23.230> of

scale so it is a midday class enough of
a<00:02:23.620> class<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:25.030> think<00:02:25.330> honestly<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.930> from

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
a class and I think honestly just from

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.830 
a class and I think honestly just from
driving<00:02:26.410> them<00:02:26.620> around<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.099> Dodge<00:02:27.370> Viper<00:02:27.840> if

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
driving them around the Dodge Viper if

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.449 
driving them around the Dodge Viper if
it<00:02:29.019> were<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.230> upgradable<00:02:29.860> worse<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.400> i

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
it were to be upgradable worse and i

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.890 
it were to be upgradable worse and i
have<00:02:30.670> an<00:02:30.880> upgraded<00:02:31.269> Dodge<00:02:31.390> Viper<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.870> I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
have an upgraded Dodge Viper that I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
have an upgraded Dodge Viper that I
driver<00:02:32.230> i<00:02:32.410> love<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.799> but<00:02:33.370> i<00:02:33.640> can't<00:02:33.940> wait<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.360> get

of my best cars that I have so I'm very
very<00:02:46.420> much<00:02:46.630> looking<00:02:46.810> forward<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.260> being<00:02:47.410> able

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
very much looking forward to being able

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.009 
very much looking forward to being able
to<00:02:47.650> upgrade<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.459> stingray<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.120> seeing

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
to upgrade the the stingray and seeing

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.400 
to upgrade the the stingray and seeing
what<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.410> capable<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:52.410> unfortunately

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
what it's capable of but unfortunately

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.910 
what it's capable of but unfortunately
it<00:02:53.650> did<00:02:54.010> lose<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.819> Viper<00:02:55.769> which<00:02:56.769> is

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it did lose to the Viper which is

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.569 
it did lose to the Viper which is
expected<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.610> Viper<00:02:57.790> was<00:02:58.000> able<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.269> run<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.750> 1

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
expected the Viper was able to run a 1

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.449 
expected the Viper was able to run a 1
18.3<00:03:00.579> 29<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.590> very<00:03:02.620> very<00:03:03.130> good<00:03:03.280> time

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
18.3 29 and that is very very good time

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.300 
18.3 29 and that is very very good time
as<00:03:03.640> well<00:03:03.670> uh<00:03:04.299> but<00:03:05.260> again<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.769> think<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
as well uh but again I think the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.190 
as well uh but again I think the
potential<00:03:06.609> really<00:03:07.060> lies<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.450> weapon<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.079> I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
potential really lies of weapon and I

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.560 
potential really lies of weapon and I
mean<00:03:08.829> come<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.579> Vipers<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.120> looking<00:03:10.359> car

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
mean come on the Vipers go looking car

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.479 
mean come on the Vipers go looking car
with<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.810> Corvette<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.410> better<00:03:11.920> looking<00:03:12.100> car

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
with the Corvette is better looking car

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.610 
with the Corvette is better looking car
I<00:03:12.850> think<00:03:13.239> most<00:03:13.450> people<00:03:13.720> would<00:03:13.750> agree<00:03:13.870> but

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
I think most people would agree but

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.470 
I think most people would agree but
