00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
through here down along this edge maybe

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.920 
through here down along this edge maybe
once<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.140> break<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.930> carefully

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
once we break that we can carefully

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.360 
once we break that we can carefully
remove<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:59.390> let<00:01:00.390> me<00:01:00.510> cut<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> few<00:01:00.989> more

crucial key spots here now you can
probably<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.840> without<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.590> sure<00:01:07.770> just

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

want to know it is it's a letter over
yes

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.830 

okay<00:01:27.770> that's<00:01:28.770> most<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.659> well<00:01:30.659> let's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
okay that's most of it now well let's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
okay that's most of it now well let's
just<00:01:31.110> try<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.070> key

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just try to get it out of the little key

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.210 
just try to get it out of the little key
points<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> go

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
points here there we go

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.620 
points here there we go
so<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> face<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so there we go and that is the face and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
so there we go and that is the face and
then<00:01:40.590> let's<00:01:40.799> bring<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.340> straw<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.369> looks

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
then let's bring in a straw and it looks

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.170 
then let's bring in a straw and it looks
like<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:46.159> cut<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> perf<00:01:47.640> there's<00:01:47.970> little

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
like you cut the perf there's little

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
like you cut the perf there's little
perforations<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.680> each<00:01:49.829> side

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.030 

okay<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.960> let's<00:02:02.259> see<00:02:02.409> they<00:02:02.619> go<00:02:02.770> back

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
okay and then let's see they go back

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.469 
okay and then let's see they go back
under<00:02:03.430> under<00:02:03.729> over<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.700> way<00:02:06.820> they<00:02:07.030> show<00:02:07.330> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
under under over so the way they show it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.130 
under under over so the way they show it
there<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.340> tab<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.569> looks<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.110> be

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
there is the tab what looks like to be

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.760 
there is the tab what looks like to be
in<00:02:11.500> front<00:02:15.569> looks<00:02:16.569> like<00:02:16.720> my<00:02:16.870> strong<00:02:17.200> little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
in front looks like my strong little

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.180 
in front looks like my strong little
work<00:02:18.690> might<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> little<00:02:20.230> too<00:02:20.440> big<00:02:20.470> no<00:02:20.950> there

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
work might be a little too big no there

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.490 
work might be a little too big no there
we<00:02:21.310> go<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.630> eyes<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:26.170> we<00:02:26.260> need<00:02:26.410> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
so we're close here let's go back to the

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.999 
so we're close here let's go back to the
scanning<00:06:34.080> section<00:06:35.449> and<00:06:36.449> here<00:06:37.229> we<00:06:37.289> are<00:06:37.319> the<00:06:37.830> egg

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
scanning section and here we are the egg

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.779 
scanning section and here we are the egg
hunt<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:40.199> then<00:06:40.860> let's<00:06:41.039> see<00:06:41.249> it<00:06:41.339> should<00:06:41.520> find

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
hunt and then let's see it should find

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.019 
hunt and then let's see it should find
it<00:06:41.939> this<00:06:42.060> time<00:06:42.330> again<00:06:46.430> it's<00:06:47.430> waiting<00:06:47.759> for<00:06:47.939> it

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029 
it this time again it's waiting for it

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.510 
it this time again it's waiting for it
to<00:06:48.120> focus<00:06:48.389> here

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
to focus here

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.179 
to focus here
once<00:06:50.520> it<00:06:50.669> focuses<00:06:51.210> then<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:51.509> finds<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:52.189> sorry

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
once it focuses then it finds it sorry

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.110 
once it focuses then it finds it sorry
you<00:06:53.370> have<00:06:53.520> already<00:06:53.789> collected<00:06:54.240> this<00:06:54.569> egg<00:06:54.870> oh

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
you have already collected this egg oh

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.290 
you have already collected this egg oh
so<00:06:57.120> it's<00:06:57.300> the<00:06:57.360> same<00:06:57.689> egg<00:06:57.870> on<00:06:58.080> each<00:06:58.319> one<00:06:59.240> mMmmm

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
so it's the same egg on each one mMmmm

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.739 
so it's the same egg on each one mMmmm
so<00:07:00.449> if<00:07:00.509> you<00:07:00.599> get<00:07:00.749> all<00:07:00.870> six<00:07:01.319> you<00:07:01.560> can't<00:07:01.860> use<00:07:02.129> them

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:02.749 
so if you get all six you can't use them

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.790 
so if you get all six you can't use them
maybe<00:07:03.749> there's<00:07:04.020> different<00:07:04.379> ones<00:07:04.469> in<00:07:04.680> the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
maybe there's different ones in the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.079 
maybe there's different ones in the
other<00:07:04.949> one<00:07:05.189> so<00:07:05.430> that's<00:07:05.699> good<00:07:05.939> to<00:07:06.060> know

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
other one so that's good to know

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.029 
other one so that's good to know
everybody<00:07:06.719> we're<00:07:06.930> going<00:07:07.050> to<00:07:07.139> when<00:07:07.710> we<00:07:07.800> get<00:07:07.949> the

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 
everybody we're going to when we get the

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.439 
everybody we're going to when we get the
other<00:07:08.069> ones<00:07:08.370> in<00:07:08.460> this<00:07:08.610> series<00:07:08.939> will<00:07:09.089> double

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
other ones in this series will double
