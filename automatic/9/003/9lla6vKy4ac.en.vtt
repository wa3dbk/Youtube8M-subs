there's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.269> lot<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.449> can<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.960> small

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
there's a lot you can do on a small

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.889 
there's a lot you can do on a small
surface<00:00:43.530> basics<00:00:44.339> of<00:00:44.489> skating<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.390> starts

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
surface basics of skating all starts

surface basics of skating all starts
with<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> scissor<00:00:46.350> cut<00:00:46.620> those<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.699> then<00:00:48.059> your

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with a scissor cut those out then your

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:12.410 
with a scissor cut those out then your
knees<00:00:50.059> pull<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.239> rising<00:00:51.719> up<00:01:08.240> full<00:01:09.259> push<00:01:10.700> push

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
knees pull in rising up full push push

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.320 
knees pull in rising up full push push
yeah<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> scissor<00:01:13.590> cut<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.700> gain<00:01:14.880> speed

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
yeah the scissor cut is to gain speed

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.169 
yeah the scissor cut is to gain speed
and<00:01:15.690> be<00:01:16.259> able<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.590> faster<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
and be able to go faster than when you

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.109 
and be able to go faster than when you
started<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.460> push

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
started as you can see I'm going push

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.370 
started as you can see I'm going push
it's<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> lot<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> speed<00:01:22.259> push<00:01:22.890> pull<00:01:23.399> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's like a lot of speed push pull and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's like a lot of speed push pull and
then<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:27.090> develop<00:01:28.310> perfect

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
then from there we develop perfect

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.499 
then from there we develop perfect
stride

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.649 

your<00:01:33.509> feet<00:01:33.720> should<00:01:33.869> always<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:35.659> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
your feet should always from that so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.880 
your feet should always from that so
your<00:01:36.810> push<00:01:37.080> starts<00:01:37.819> just<00:01:38.819> waiting<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
your push starts just waiting out the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:02:03.510 
your push starts just waiting out the
perfect<00:01:41.099> stride

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.249 

let<00:02:04.520> boys<00:02:05.350> good<00:02:06.350> skaters<00:02:07.780> wide<00:02:08.780> across<00:02:09.140> the

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
let boys good skaters wide across the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.580 
let boys good skaters wide across the
ice<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.979> make<00:02:10.850> no<00:02:11.030> thoughts<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:14.900> place<00:02:15.290> our

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
ice and make no thoughts we place our

00:02:15.590 --> 00:03:01.940 
ice and make no thoughts we place our
feet<00:02:15.830> down<00:02:16.209> we<00:02:17.209> don't<00:02:27.700> escape

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:41.270 

[Music]

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:04:22.070 

[Applause]

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:05:42.410 

my<00:04:23.080> shoulders

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.750 

you<00:05:43.420> start<00:05:43.750> off<00:05:43.840> slow<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.530> if<00:05:45.460> you<00:05:45.580> have

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
you start off slow and if you have

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.160 
you start off slow and if you have
rhythm<00:05:46.140> you<00:05:47.140> can<00:05:47.170> speed<00:05:47.590> it<00:05:47.620> up<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:49.090> fast<00:05:49.360> you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
rhythm you can speed it up be fast you

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.450 
rhythm you can speed it up be fast you
home<00:05:50.350> lift<00:05:50.530> your<00:05:50.920> step

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
home lift your step

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.610 
home lift your step
the<00:05:52.150> minute<00:05:52.390> you<00:05:52.480> try<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.750> speed<00:05:53.050> things<00:05:53.200> up

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
the minute you try to speed things up

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.930 
the minute you try to speed things up
everything<00:05:54.070> gets<00:05:54.130> together<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:54.670> won't<00:05:54.850> go

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
everything gets together you won't go

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.030 
everything gets together you won't go
any<00:05:55.060> faster<00:05:55.480> so<00:05:55.900> we<00:05:55.930> try<00:05:56.200> to<00:05:56.230> build<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.710> rhythm

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
any faster so we try to build a rhythm

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.590 
any faster so we try to build a rhythm
that's<00:05:57.700> what<00:05:57.850> very<00:05:58.030> counting

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
that's what very counting

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.460 
that's what very counting
push<00:05:58.870> push<00:05:59.440> one<00:05:59.980> two<00:06:00.550> one<00:06:01.210> two<00:06:01.480> then<00:06:02.230> when<00:06:02.380> you

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
push push one two one two then when you

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:14.369 
push push one two one two then when you
speed<00:06:02.800> up<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.220> rhythm

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.749 

combination<00:06:15.379> of<00:06:15.440> ingredients<00:06:15.560> to<00:06:16.430> life

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
combination of ingredients to life

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.539 
combination of ingredients to life
pretty<00:06:17.270> smooth
