00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
yes the natural question then would be

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.309 
yes the natural question then would be
if<00:00:02.310> somebody<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.060> redefining<00:00:03.720> what<00:00:03.899> it<00:00:04.049> means

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
if somebody is redefining what it means

might<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.650> behind<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.160> through<00:00:11.670> history

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
might be behind this through history

might be behind this through history
could<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.599> cite<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:12.990> cases<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
could you cite some cases so so the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.499 
could you cite some cases so so the
people<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> audience<00:00:14.790> who<00:00:15.120> might<00:00:15.150> think

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
people in the audience who might think

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.790 
people in the audience who might think
that<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.960> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.199> conspiratorial

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
that this is kind of conspiratorial

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
that this is kind of conspiratorial
we're<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.550> talking<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.119> some<00:00:18.420> deep

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we're actually talking about some deep

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.320 
we're actually talking about some deep
history<00:00:19.080> here<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.650> I'd<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> maybe<00:00:21.000> flesh

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
history here and I'd like to maybe flesh

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.070 
history here and I'd like to maybe flesh
out<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> characters<00:00:23.330> well<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
out some of the characters well this is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
out some of the characters well this is
the<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> worms<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.670> there

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the can of worms because I think there

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
the can of worms because I think there
are<00:00:27.060> two<00:00:27.300> forces<00:00:27.779> at<00:00:27.990> work<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
are two forces at work here one is a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.099 
are two forces at work here one is a
natural<00:00:29.490> force<00:00:29.730> than<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
natural force than one is it a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
natural force than one is it a
conspiratorial<00:00:32.009> force<00:00:32.570> because<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> might

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
conspiratorial force because you might

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.410 
conspiratorial force because you might
argue<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.670> conspiracies<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.700> natural

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
argue that conspiracies are natural

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
argue that conspiracies are natural
force<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> way<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> think<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.219> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
force which in in a way I think they are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.440 
force which in in a way I think they are
because<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.690> look<00:00:39.899> at<00:00:40.250> history

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.020 

conspiracies<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.110> engine<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.590> history

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
or is that an unnatural for us I don't

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.370

on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.680> hand<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.189> natural

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
on the other hand there are natural

follows with this idea x you see if you

follows with this idea x you see if you
if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.520> believe<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.680> proper<00:02:02.070> function

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
if you believe that the proper function

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060 
if you believe that the proper function

of the state is to solve all problems

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
of the state is to solve all problems
then<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> give<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> state<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
then you have to give the state the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.699 
then you have to give the state the
power<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:09.330> solve<00:02:09.539> those<00:02:09.780> problems<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.530> need

would have been illegal to do but once

would have been illegal to do but once
they're<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> inside<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.600> mechanism

they're on the inside of the mechanism

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.320 
they're on the inside of the mechanism
that<00:03:28.320> decides<00:03:28.770> what<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.190> legal<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.790> what<00:03:30.209> is

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
that decides what is legal and what is

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.360 
that decides what is legal and what is
illegal<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:30.930> they're<00:03:31.500> protected<00:03:32.160> they're

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
illegal now they're protected they're

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.300 
illegal now they're protected they're
insulated<00:03:32.700> from<00:03:33.060> punishment<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
insulated from punishment so this is the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.880 
insulated from punishment so this is the
natural<00:03:35.520> force<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.180> talking<00:03:36.600> about<00:03:36.690> if<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.590> in

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
natural force I'm talking about if we in
