what<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> clock<00:01:19.530> said<00:01:19.859> at<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.130> end<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
what the clock said at the end but the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.819 
what the clock said at the end but the
owners<00:01:24.359> were<00:01:24.509> real<00:01:24.780> friendly<00:01:25.229> real<00:01:25.590> laid-back

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.710 

I<00:01:29.610> believe<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.730> a<00:01:30.850> couple<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.330> other<00:01:31.450> car

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
I believe it a couple of other car

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.000 
I believe it a couple of other car
owners<00:01:31.990> were<00:01:32.110> also<00:01:32.290> there<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.500> witness<00:01:32.650> this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
owners were also there to witness this
