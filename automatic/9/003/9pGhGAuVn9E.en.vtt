00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
so here's example of a protein skimmer

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
so here's example of a protein skimmer
it's<00:00:41.190> about<00:00:41.340> three<00:00:41.850> years<00:00:41.969> old<00:00:42.270> still<00:00:42.989> working

your equipment in the vinegar after a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
your equipment in the vinegar after a
couple<00:01:16.920> days<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.729> algae<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.270> fall

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
couple days the algae would just fall

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
couple days the algae would just fall
right<00:01:18.659> off<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.040> two<00:01:20.189> reasons<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.580> like

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
number one it works really really well

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
number one it works really really well
and<00:01:24.240> number<00:01:24.659> two<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.290> cheap

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and number two it's really cheap

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
and number two it's really cheap
container<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.939> run<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
container like this run you about a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
container like this run you about a
dollar<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.170> local<00:01:28.409> grocery<00:01:28.770> store<00:01:28.799> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
dollar in your local grocery store so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
dollar in your local grocery store so
how<00:01:29.790> much<00:01:29.880> money<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.780> well

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
how much money are we going to use well

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
how much money are we going to use well
the<00:01:31.500> answer<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.340> never<00:01:32.549> use

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the answer is you can really never use

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
the answer is you can really never use
too<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.020> definitely<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
too much so we're definitely to use the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
too much so we're definitely to use the
rest<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.100> container<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> we'll

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
rest of this container and we'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.609 
rest of this container and we'll
probably<00:01:36.750> use<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
probably use some more out of this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
probably use some more out of this
container<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.030> said

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
container as well because like I said

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.649 
container as well because like I said
you<00:01:39.390> can't<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.810> too<00:01:39.960> much<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.579> clean<00:01:42.570> your

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you can't use too much so clean your

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
you can't use too much so clean your
equipment<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> vinegar<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.979> first

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
equipment with this vinegar just first

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
dump your vinegar in make sure you got a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
dump your vinegar in make sure you got a
large<00:01:48.180> bucket<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.810> container<00:01:49.320> such

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
large bucket like this container such

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.700 
large bucket like this container such
that<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.670> equipment<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.119> submerged

if remember two days ago it was full
this<00:03:06.470> coral<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:06.889> algae<00:03:07.010> well<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.819> still

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
this coral and algae well it's still

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.610 
this coral and algae well it's still
there<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.569> usually<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.079> only<00:03:09.319> way<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:09.470> get

there and usually the only way to get

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.080 
there and usually the only way to get
rid<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.799> corland<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.519> scrape<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.849> with<00:03:10.970> a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
rid of corland is to scrape it with a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.000 
rid of corland is to scrape it with a
razor<00:03:11.329> blade<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.019> inside<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.620> body<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.889> the

razor blade and inside the body of the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670 
razor blade and inside the body of the
skimmer<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.519> can't<00:03:13.879> get<00:03:14.030> my<00:03:14.150> hand<00:03:14.480> down<00:03:15.049> bad<00:03:15.319> so

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
skimmer I can't get my hand down bad so

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.569 
skimmer I can't get my hand down bad so
that's<00:03:15.799> not<00:03:15.950> an<00:03:16.099> option

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
that's not an option

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.270 
that's not an option
but<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.959> skimmers<00:03:18.709> been<00:03:18.859> soaking<00:03:19.099> in
