 It opened again, it means, I am very happy, I did not see the birth of dessert, and 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.179
 dessert but super bowl completely a pole of Moroccan origin 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.550
 percent or good and managers coso of Moroccan origin and Moroccan influence 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 for by sea a great set 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 and in fact he investigates with a phyllo dough to score the white apron when 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.090
 working some flours 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.590
 the first thing we're going to do is the good level of easy consumption of the world by 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 that I admire what they need are 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.620
 equal parts of sugar that of water that there is a rate at sunset 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.900
 a savings rate 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.570
 that's how it sounds 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 and the rest 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 as reporters always say 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.330
 forget that they abandon it completely 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.870
 today's recipe has 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.920
 many elements therefore it is a recipe 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.219
 in which they can not 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.199
 lose me distracted very aware of all the things I'm going to do because 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.399
 a great advantage the only thing with which one must know the proportions in what 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.890
 of sugar because everything else I intuitive devil does not matter if a 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 little bit less 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 a little more 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.899
 to the mihdar I will be a syrup or basil 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.899
 among other things therefore I have a uvi watching here 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.610
 we put basil allow me a second to make it very comfortable to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 my 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.250
 perfect like that directly 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.570
 in a colander 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.290
 We passed it through hot water quickly its start to fix 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 color to ensure that there is in the entity 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.910
 very fast because the cow of all in the area where the fastest 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.189
 deteriorates excessive by firewood to fire 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.820
 and quickly we will place 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 in grandmother 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.480
 thing to cool 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.280
 immediately this ended with ten perfect be quick as you saw it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 once they have it and so 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.940
 she has said is still to be decided she fulfilled her mission 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.520
 I have here syrup dean that the syrup is a fairly light thing of textures 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.260
 the same thing I'm doing here artibone water syrup that from his mouth 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.289
 and I'm going to liquefy the basil with 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.639
 the syrup 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.719
 they take all that little mouth 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.739
 the mint a little 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.709
 place here 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.540
 i wash is going to liquefy well from the blender fields as a partico 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.169
 this 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.389
 hugo daniel as I said 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.139
 and by the way 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.259
 let your children's imagination start flying because the truth is that 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.689
 what to make in syrup almost any liquefied 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.279
 very very nice review 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.289
 ten matches 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
 and the challenge 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.089
 others all for having declared 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.629
 madrid efe 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.629
 He assured that it is something special 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.609
 for them 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.489
 I have not done that 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.489
 I insist then the operative conservative fact 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.859
 we are going to agree to see 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.249
 and although he did not have all the citadel home 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.299
 I'm not interested 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.099
 clearly colander 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.569
 we put our mix 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.699
 you can see it 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.549
 we head well 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.479
 what we are having down here 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.509
 selfishly endorsed a sweet sweet sweet syrup 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.329
 surprising basil 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.389
 the viola trinidad interview ideas rights to life on the verge of life that 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.939
 in one of the great challenges but the world knows it actually 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.089
 in cataluña 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:48.449
 and that's why it's interesting that it would have been where the experimental phase did not 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.550
 with mine arenteiro nuanced with 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.460
 something I like radiator an option that had 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.599
 let's say of that idea that they do not have so pretty and so 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.369
 as they are in sight 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:59.359
 perfect 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.719
 so we have then that a yale element 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.779
 to the basil mihdar 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:04.979
 what else are we going to do 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.619
 here I am going to mix 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.179
 Orange zest 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.020
 simply the skin of the orange 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.939
 well rayadito 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.779
 I'm going to mix it with almond a bulldozer with 20 toast and without the skin 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.919
 so see that they are seriously preventing roasting 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.210
 cinnamon 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.309
 little bit of cinnamon 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:30.979
 josé tomás and their solid cardboard see that what none of this knows that 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.009
 there's nothing that I'm going to go back pasty 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.559
 it's all like this is like a big almond pole with orange zest 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.199
 cinnamon and sugar 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.009
 just as you want, we were going to regenerate 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.740
 massa style with those elements that I just describe you there with all that branch 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.099
 so let's go to work with that dough 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.830
 and every so often and be aware 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.949
 demi syrup 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.729
 this if they had a thermometer are 118 120 degrees Celsius 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.629
 the point at which you pay but equal value our phases realize when this 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.449
 I have here 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.740
 phyllo dough if you have not worked with them before 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.880
 good news very easy to work the edge dough is something that nobody does if not 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.930
 buy I think there is something like a kind of the secret group that makes 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.469
 more claimed mena managed to teach how it is done 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.580
 but in any case it is very common within the Greek and Greek kitchen all the 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:25.050
 Greek poles expected to increase 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.409
 leave from it 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.199
 her one community was July and another one with her to buy what is there 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.560
 be very clear where is the Arab community of your country 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.830
 but that they are always going to sell since we are poorer almost transparent 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.129
 like the ones I have here 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.740
 what they have to do in irc 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.909
 the bigamist separating the leaves 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.849
 little what I'm going to show you here 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.930
 daubing the cooperators 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.960
 efe 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.059
 to show them well conca lover that with fat 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.849
 but in this case butter specified the word fat 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.849
 because if you are doing for example a work en masse edge with 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.339
 a instead of stuffed almonds for example they were filling that 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.830
 He brought ricotta cheese like olives instead of beale butter 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.499
 sheet 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.350
 What they do is add, for example, if I want trouble 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.840
 even the sectorial cost aromatized with that requires if that 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.180
 you want a generic 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.120
 only in this case because it is a dessert that hernán piquín fat 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.849
 so we put 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.849
 we trust one act over the other that you can not see 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:29.930
 it's funny because people always 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.270
 I see it many times 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.860
 he says that he prefers mass things and means to sport for a hundred 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.590
 a dough that is made without fat what is true for dough or soda grasshoppers 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.430
 the house that puts you or not after 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.850
 to work the sphere of the same do not catch problem that is very rich 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.879
 because this happened because of what is achieved with him 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.020
 we hang another face 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.159
 of the mass 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.899
 at the end of the line k 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:55.809
 for them 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:58.309
 the desire for perfect 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:59.529
 and always 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.159
 daubing with 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.159
 from a little bit of butter to retreat 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.860
 how are we going to work this 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.129
 Ibiza deaths working and generating by three layers 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.770
 from the blade of a knife we ​​look for you to venerate it haiti 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:22.930
 I know how we're going to work percent in this case the most 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.089
 trim 

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:26.659
 a chorus here like in the middle 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.729
 that depends on the diamond is being 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.169
 will pretend that 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:34.169
 ii I'm going to cut it 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.080
 4th I would say if we cut a marker 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.270
 we're here 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.240
 and we cut here
