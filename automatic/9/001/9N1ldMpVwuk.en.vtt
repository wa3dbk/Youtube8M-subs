00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.510
 good afternoon everybody my name is yuri and here i am 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.330
 decided to record a video review of his car 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.589
 which I want to sell my 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.839
 swallows who left for a year and a half 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.140
 and it's time to upgrade your fleet 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.730
 That's probably honest car for 10 years 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.710
 my driving experience which 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.600
 which is absolutely attached to me 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.730
 principle suits both on the way 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.310
 quality and appearance in general, and you 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.080
 distinctive feature here but it's time 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.060
 upgrade fleet buy more fresh 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.969
 car and so I decided for your 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.739
 convenience to hold a small video review 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.530
 to understand or once again did not go 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.710
 that's all I can now on shinya 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.350
 they tell actually this audi 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.839
 December 2007 issue 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.019
 That was sold in 2008 19 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.469
 turbo diesel 115 horsepower engine 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.390
 brb right before that I would have 6 audi 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.670
 engine 19 itself but very 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.359
 lucky no questions together ever 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.750
 there was no white car 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.640
 very rare instance actually in 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 color plan here it came out Neva package 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.039
 Here we have a bleed and we have the rear 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 these visors 17 tires 235 45 on 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.899
 original ones 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.899
 audi concern with fresh tires 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:30.039
 depth of 7 millimeters here 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.890
 we have a river here 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.810
 slave salon here is the seat unfortunately not 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.229
 I had time to clean but here the point is 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.060
 what is 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.979
 enhanced lateral support 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.789
 legs three-spoke steering wheel now inside and 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.990
 let's see what's here and here yet 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.960
 useless navigation system audi 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.679
 which we did not work well, it mp3 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.280
 jack here and there is also a sitting changer for 6 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.979
 drives 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.159
 also the car if you can see of course 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.560
 black ceiling is very convenient even 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.009
 I did not think that it would be cool with him as well 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.250
 here is a dimming mirror like 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.759
 the main mirror and both side 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.220
 mirrors 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.120
 they black out if the hall is someone bright 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 is shining 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 we have a five- speed gearbox 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.909
 here is a leather steering wheel with white stitching 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.860
 It is used as the previous nor the rocks 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.709
 the owner here were mats too with white 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 stitching but how did he rock did not get dirty and 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.989
 he changed one rug so shitty was 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.340
 the fact that he live with me and I broke through 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.190
 cut off this bullshit which chains as 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.620
 I always had time to buy a shoe and 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.769
 rubber mats on it for now 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.769
 there is 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.200
 what else can i tell about the car i would 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.709
 put the curtains here because with them 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.500
 as it looks more fun combination 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.269
 black and white cool we have 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.010
 folding mirrors 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.230
 front or rear lifts only 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.069
 concrete mixers why I never understood in 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.599
 this configuration puts the car 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.599
 agitators climate 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.640
 machine practices i tend to believe what 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.909
 this is the original 207 thousand kilometers 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.650
 Here are the cards and drove on audi 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.319
 service center said that from the car all 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.180
 okay no serious about her 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.430
 problems at least in germany not 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.519
 was judging by the external condition of the body 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.590
 oh well lovely and see for yourself i'm not 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.239
 what bugs any problems in it saw 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 he has all the arches 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.409
 the only thing is that they are such little disks 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.500
 shake on the corners well this is not 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:45.849
 criminal nifiga not seen here 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.530
 Our arches are small such here 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.359
 problems like this here 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.000
 I am probably the door of the door or something 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.269
 it is necessary to erase the trace of solvent 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.609
 other paint of any car rear bumper 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.189
 there are such about the scuffing of his such plan 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.159
 yes but i think that by polishing they are all 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.819
 cleaned up here the car is standard 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.709
 factory subwoofer 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.099
 sound good sound this car if 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.959
 it is important to someone further I think that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.699
 We can move somehow it probably 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.799
 features not engine features 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.289
 from engine operation 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:28.750
 here we included it no mistakes with us 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:31.240
 there is no machine without problems for 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.300
 winter there was not one I cant 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.650
 just turned on the handbrake all the buttons 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:44.530
 work all switch abdullah 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.770
 candychan all right here so 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.940
 bone gain advanced settings 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.930
 You can customize them at all 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.880
 all laid up down 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.509
 raise for legs support as i already 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.650
 spoke here even have their way it 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.650
 here crap on the back 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.650
 So 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.340
 as for the engine 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.289
 maybe to but it will be important to someone 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.210
 no matter the engine is running without unnecessary 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.689
 noise 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.689
 no problem 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.110
 clearly 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.090
 and without vibration 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.310
 all fluids are normal with their cars 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:37.730
 ready to check on any statute 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.190
 on consumption in the city personally my measurements with 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.870
 my driving style is eight and a half 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:48.170
 liters in the city and 6 half liters 6 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.780
 liters on the highway at speeds up to 110 120 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.530
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.090
 the only thing I missed in this 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.240
 car so it is 6 speed box 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:02.410
 gears 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:05.240
 so what else to tell you about my swallow 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:10.280
 I think these are the main points on 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:14.030
 which should pay attention to her 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.530
 the advantage is as far as 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.210
 what to do need to be a car oil 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.220
 changed it 5 thousand kilometers ago 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.680
 30 thousand kilometers ago I changed in 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.240
 her dual mass flywheel with clutch 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.720
 vyzhimny general complete set I 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:34.010
 put the registry office so about the clutch 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.860
 You can forget the box Graham changed to 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.770
 car 60,000 kilometers back on 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.480
 this future owner is the moment 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.840
 worth paying attention to in the near 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.760
 next year maybe next here 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.790
 will you have any questions call 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.650
 And from the questions about the car that I 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.210
 I want to eliminate if you have time do not progress 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.780
 the next driver will be in time 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.790
 the car has parking sensors and I have a report 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.050
 with frog shifting when including 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.540
 my rear gear doesn't turn on 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.690
 spore tronic and back light here 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.790
 the problem is serious, that's just all protection 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.830
 and clean either the pins or replace 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.480
 and the frog as it is called 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.360
 here are the pads great condition if 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.060
 it will be seen like this principle and wheels 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.510
 replacement does not require tires as I 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.820
 spoke 7 millimeters her depth we 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.830
 at least when I bought the month 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.920
 a half ago as it could be profitable 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.130
 be now and 6 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.940
 that's what the phone says 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.800
 look below 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.450
 if there are remains there are questions call 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.330
 and come see how not to 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.910
 I wanted to sell but the time came 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:51.070
 like i told myself too but a four but 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.070
 more fresh year thanks all good
