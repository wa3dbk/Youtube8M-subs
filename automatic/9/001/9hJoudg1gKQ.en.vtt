00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'm here it's gonna be a bit more of a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:37.030 
I'm here it's gonna be a bit more of a
pain<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.890> work<00:01:35.070> with

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
pain and now that you have to work with

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.500 
pain and now that you have to work with
all<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> finally<00:01:39.120> got<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> frame

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
all right so I finally got the frame

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.440 
all right so I finally got the frame
sliders<00:01:39.870> on<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.050> ran<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.620> bit<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.920> problem

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
sliders on I ran into a bit of a problem

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.890 
sliders on I ran into a bit of a problem
what<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> wasn't<00:01:43.470> totally<00:01:43.800> aware<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.160> was<00:01:44.580> this

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
what I wasn't totally aware of was this

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.200 
what I wasn't totally aware of was this
bar<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.950> same<00:01:47.190> bar<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.580> goes<00:01:47.729> through<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
bar the same bar that goes through the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.630 
bar the same bar that goes through the
now<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.390> frame<00:01:48.690> sliders<00:01:49.080> are<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.380> through

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
now the frame sliders are going through

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
now the frame sliders are going through
is<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.910> keeps<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> engine<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.660> place<00:01:52.100> so

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is what keeps the engine in place so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.580 
is what keeps the engine in place so
when<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> took<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.550> out<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.170> engine<00:01:55.410> didn't

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
when I took it out the engine didn't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
when I took it out the engine didn't
necessarily<00:01:55.680> fall<00:01:56.160> out<00:01:56.400> but<00:01:57.300> because<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
necessarily fall out but because of the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.650 
necessarily fall out but because of the
weight<00:01:58.050> of<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.259> obviously<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:59.540> couldn't<00:02:00.540> get

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
weight of it obviously I couldn't get

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.930 
weight of it obviously I couldn't get
the<00:02:00.840> frame<00:02:01.619> slider<00:02:01.860> bar<00:02:02.130> through<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the frame slider bar through because it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.300 
the frame slider bar through because it
was<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.500> didn't<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.830> clean<00:02:05.100> way

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
was the that it didn't have a clean way

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.400 
was the that it didn't have a clean way
to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.550> through<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.660> now<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.050> wife<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
some blocks of wood and then slowly like

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.600 
some blocks of wood and then slowly like
slowly<00:02:15.959> let<00:02:16.200> her<00:02:16.320> let<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.860> bike<00:02:17.040> down<00:02:17.220> from

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
slowly let her let the bike down from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.979 
slowly let her let the bike down from
the<00:02:18.350> from<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> stand<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.060> even<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.750> wasn't

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the from the stand and even that wasn't

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.590 
the from the stand and even that wasn't
enough<00:02:22.290> weight<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> thing<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
enough weight to to get the thing and so

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
enough weight to to get the thing and so
what<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> had<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.989> do<00:02:25.049> was<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.230> actually<00:02:25.290> got<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
what I had to do was I actually got to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620 
what I had to do was I actually got to
sit<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> bike<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> press<00:02:26.489> forward<00:02:26.820> press

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
sit on the bike and press forward press

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.180 
sit on the bike and press forward press
down<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> handle<00:02:28.350> bars<00:02:28.560> which<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.040> know

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
down on the handle bars which you know

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.789 
down on the handle bars which you know
push<00:02:29.700> down<00:02:29.850> on<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> forks<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.680> was

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
push down on the forks and then I was

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.000 
push down on the forks and then I was
finally<00:02:31.980> able<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:33.049> get<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.230> frame<00:02:34.620> sliders

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
finally able to get the frame sliders

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
finally able to get the frame sliders
through<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.459> doubt<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.150> they're<00:02:36.239> really

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
through I doubt that they're really

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.000 
through I doubt that they're really
supposed<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.440> big<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.799> pain

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
supposed to be that that big of a pain

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.490 
supposed to be that that big of a pain
but<00:02:39.000> oh<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.360> problem<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.660> ran<00:02:39.840> into<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.410> if

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
but oh that's a problem I ran into so if

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.660 
but oh that's a problem I ran into so if
you're<00:02:40.620> looking<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.100> frame<00:02:41.280> sliders

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you're looking to get your frame sliders

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.039 
you're looking to get your frame sliders
on<00:02:41.820> I'll<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.269> be<00:02:42.540> aware<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
on I'll just be aware of that and

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.610 
on I'll just be aware of that and
probably<00:02:46.049> what<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> should<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.410> done<00:02:46.470> was

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
probably what I should have done was

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.840 
probably what I should have done was
actually<00:02:46.739> listen<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> instructions

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
actually listen to the instructions

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.090 
actually listen to the instructions
which<00:02:48.390> says<00:02:48.690> as<00:02:49.260> you're<00:02:49.470> pushing<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.860> bar

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
which says as you're pushing this bar
