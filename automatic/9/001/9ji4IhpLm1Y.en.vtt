actually<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.620> wanted<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> worry<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.490> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

using<00:00:44.880> special<00:00:45.420> moves

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.229 

we<00:00:50.200> drive<00:00:50.590> one<00:00:50.890> move<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.430> hopefully<00:00:52.030> it

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
we drive one move and hopefully it

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.370 
we drive one move and hopefully it
doesn't<00:00:52.420> count<00:00:52.690> as<00:00:52.900> special<00:00:53.590> use<00:00:54.220> earthquake

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
doesn't count as special use earthquake

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.490

the<00:00:56.380> special<00:00:56.770> go<00:00:56.920> back<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.190> rock<00:00:57.400> smash

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.650
