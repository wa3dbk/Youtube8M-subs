00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
hard on the lock and it should be like

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.130 
hard on the lock and it should be like
pretty<00:02:05.009> much<00:02:05.219> impossible<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.869> get<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140

going<00:02:07.439> well<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.280> went<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.090> see

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
going well I just went a little bit see

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.979 
going well I just went a little bit see
if<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.819> push<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
if we can do this now is just push there

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.089 
if we can do this now is just push there
you<00:02:13.050> go

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
you go

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.640 
you go
so<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> third<00:02:15.930> number<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.349> don't<00:02:16.439> even

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
so I for the third number you don't even

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.520 
so I for the third number you don't even
have<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:17.629> you<00:02:18.629> didn't<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.200> push<00:02:19.379> up

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
