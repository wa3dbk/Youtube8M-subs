00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 to the middle of the recovery court and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.410
 precision when delivering balls 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.410
 is with someone 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.790
 Of course I'm with Captain MatÃ­as 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.860
 I heard that this week he was 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.539
 birthday as we have said time 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.070
 victory that serves to add as 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.650
 feel 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.550
 Well the truth is that it is a victory 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.189
 comes barbarian we had 3 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.079
 and honestly I feel proud with 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 the group of players that I have because 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.189
 the truth to people do not know but 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.379
 institutionally we are going through 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.760
 a very bad moment the truth that no 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.570
 we have the support of nobody today 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.100
 there are guys here who left their lives and in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.800
 the week they only have to take care of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 not only have to deal with solving 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 your problem and nobody takes care of us 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.460
 phone then beyond that be 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.309
 for us I think they are doing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.229
 bad to the institution in Barcelona that 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.300
 It is the largest in the country and you have to 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.399
 pay tribute to that we are 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.129
 proud of being able to give him a triumph 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.230
 to this institution and to all the people who 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.879
 supports us and hopefully in the week 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.289
 someone at least go and get 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.630
 present to solve the problems that 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.810
 we have what is the role of soler in the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.660
 motivation in the rise of the team that 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 we train very well during the week 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.140
 we also want 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 solve those problems within the 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.020
 court that our for that too 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.900
 we hope it is reciprocal of the other 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.060
 side last year in the stadium this one 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.300
 when we are about to emerge champion there was 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.009
 20 people where almost not even 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.130
 we could change today there is only one 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.259
 then more than for us there is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.970
 do something for the institution that is the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.000
 what else is harmed and all this 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.220
 people from Barcelona who feel passion for 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 this club now the last of manu 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 congratulations diego and paco because 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.590
 we know what to do father 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.310
 I'm personally going through the best 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.680
 moment I appreciate but I take the opportunity to 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.370
 send a kiss my wife and my son 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.100
 you take your turn grace figure 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.780
 firing what matias oyola said today 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.430
 day had nothing to do with the match with 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.950
 1 to 0 being with the environment and with 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.480
 institutional situations that are 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.950
 living lately is the captain spoke 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.300
 last year you could not walk in the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.860
 costumes for the amount of leaders that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.990
 there was only one person this year 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 incredible took advantage of the moment I've 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.470
 marked was interviewing him to speak 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.870
 of the party to talk about what is 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.220
 he lived he lived on court and what I take 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.660
 MatÃ­as Oyola went to talk 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.930
 surely some discomfort that there is in the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.930
 team
