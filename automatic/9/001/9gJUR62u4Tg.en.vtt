00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.830 

then<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> ran<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> treatment<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> seafoam

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
then I ran a treatment of seafoam

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.170 
then I ran a treatment of seafoam
through<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.469> did<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.190> facts<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.640> autozone

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
through it I did in facts on autozone

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.440 
through it I did in facts on autozone
before<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> even<00:00:39.930> started<00:00:40.640> tear<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
before I even started tear into it and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.940 
before I even started tear into it and
have<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> codes<00:00:43.020> checked<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.530> everything<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
have the codes checked and everything it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.630 
have the codes checked and everything it
wasn't<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> single<00:00:44.579> code<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.030> found<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.870> all

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
wasn't a single code to be found at all

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
wasn't a single code to be found at all
you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.789> which<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.420> good<00:00:49.170> idea<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you know which have good idea to do to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
you know which have good idea to do to
begin<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.840> passed<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
begin with it's just I passed by it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.260 
begin with it's just I passed by it
enough<00:00:53.100> everyday<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.230> anyways<00:00:55.969> right<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
enough everyday so anyways right here as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
enough everyday so anyways right here as
you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.710> TPS<00:00:59.190> sensor<00:00:59.219> on

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you can see this is your TPS sensor on

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
you can see this is your TPS sensor on
the<00:01:00.000> 4.7<00:01:00.750> magnum<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:02.489> course<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.860> cop

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the 4.7 magnum of course it's the cop

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.270 
the 4.7 magnum of course it's the cop
sensor<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.479> there<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.600> three<00:01:06.869> wires<00:01:07.280> they

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sensor here there are three wires they

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
sensor here there are three wires they
go<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> TPS<00:01:09.479> sensor<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:10.409> course<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
go to the the TPS sensor of course this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.850 
go to the the TPS sensor of course this
far<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> black<00:01:12.840> negative<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
far one here is the black negative so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
far one here is the black negative so
that's<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.490> ground<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
that's going to be your ground and the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.440 
that's going to be your ground and the
center<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.860> course<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.090> supply

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
center one of course is your your supply

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
center one of course is your your supply
line<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:19.259> supply<00:01:19.530> wire<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> can't<00:01:21.330> see

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
line your supply wire so you can't see

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.109 
line your supply wire so you can't see
it<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.540> negative

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it very well but I have the the negative

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
it very well but I have the the negative
lead<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.630> multi<00:01:27.930> tester<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> way<00:01:28.890> at

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
lead for my multi tester all the way at

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.210 
lead for my multi tester all the way at
the<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> positive

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the very back and I have the positive

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.630 
the very back and I have the positive
lead<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> center<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:35.460> ohms

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
lead right in the center I have my ohms

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.710 
lead right in the center I have my ohms

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
have it set on 20,000 ohms and as you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.950 
have it set on 20,000 ohms and as you
can<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.620> just<00:01:43.220> simply<00:01:43.730> by<00:01:43.940> being<00:01:44.330> turned<00:01:44.780> on

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
can see just simply by being turned on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.290 
can see just simply by being turned on
there<00:01:45.230> I'm<00:01:45.560> getting<00:01:46.010> an<00:01:46.100> old<00:01:46.220> reading<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.700> 2.4

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
there I'm getting an old reading of 2.4

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300 
there I'm getting an old reading of 2.4
and<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.190> changing<00:01:49.900> now<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:51.230> reach<00:01:51.980> over<00:01:52.280> here

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
and it is changing now I reach over here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.280 
and it is changing now I reach over here
and<00:01:52.520> I'll<00:01:52.760> push<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.420> throttle<00:01:53.780> body<00:01:53.870> down

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
and I'll push the throttle body down

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.960 
and I'll push the throttle body down
which<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.650> know<00:01:54.980> would<00:01:55.190> just<00:01:55.430> basically

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
which you know would just basically

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.340 
which you know would just basically
close<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.780> again<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:59.720> just<00:01:59.780> holding<00:02:00.260> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
close it again and I'm just holding it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.520 
close it again and I'm just holding it
closed<00:02:01.810> just<00:02:02.810> putting<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> little<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.380> of

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
closed just putting a little bit of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.960 
closed just putting a little bit of
pressure<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.730> moving

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
pressure on it and you can see it moving

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.360 
pressure on it and you can see it moving
down<00:02:05.210> jump<00:02:06.140> back<00:02:06.290> up<00:02:06.470> when<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:06.650> let<00:02:06.890> off<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.070> it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
down jump back up when I let off of it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.180 
down jump back up when I let off of it
okay
