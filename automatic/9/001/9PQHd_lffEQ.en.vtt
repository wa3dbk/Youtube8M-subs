first night I guess I was watching some
videos<00:04:10.359> about<00:04:10.389> it<00:04:10.780> but<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.199> does<00:04:11.560> seem<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.919> bit

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
videos about it but it does seem a bit

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.189 
videos about it but it does seem a bit
difficult<00:04:12.660> especially<00:04:13.660> because<00:04:14.109> they

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
difficult especially because they

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:56.710 
difficult especially because they
haven't<00:04:14.349> played<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:14.799> game<00:04:14.859> like<00:04:15.250> ever
