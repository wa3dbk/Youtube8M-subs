that<00:02:09.610> covers<00:02:10.479> all<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:12.810> common<00:02:13.810> drops<00:02:14.110> in

general or I mean I think that covers

all<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.480> your<00:02:16.720> instance<00:02:17.170> cost<00:02:17.560> all<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.980> your

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
all of your instance cost all of your

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.420 
all of your instance cost all of your

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
supply costs even if you die I think

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.960 
supply costs even if you die I think
that<00:02:21.790> covers<00:02:22.210> all<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.780> costs<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.380> and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that covers all of the costs there and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
that covers all of the costs there and
this<00:02:24.970> might<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.420> inaccurate<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.200> uncut<00:02:26.560> onyx

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
this might be inaccurate the uncut onyx

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.010 
this might be inaccurate the uncut onyx
it<00:02:27.190> might<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> little<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.360> less<00:02:28.570> right<00:02:28.840> now

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
it might be a little bit less right now

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.490 
it might be a little bit less right now
maybe<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:30.010> 300<00:02:30.490> k<00:02:30.640> less<00:02:30.910> at<00:02:31.120> most<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.410> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
maybe like 300 k less at most so you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.590 
maybe like 300 k less at most so you
might<00:02:32.770> want<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> math<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
might want to do the math on that it

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.220 
might want to do the math on that it
would<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.200> around<00:02:35.500> 4.8<00:02:36.250> millis<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.959> these

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
would be around 4.8 millis but these

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.860 
would be around 4.8 millis but these
could<00:02:38.530> also<00:02:38.740> go<00:02:39.160> up<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.640> well<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.630> because

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
could also go up as well just because

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.740 
could also go up as well just because
they<00:02:41.200> may<00:02:41.470> be<00:02:41.500> considering<00:02:42.400> having<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.570> high

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
they may be considering having a high

they may be considering having a high
tricks<00:02:44.110> jewelry<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:44.830> repairable<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.840> yeah

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
tricks jewelry be repairable so yeah

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900 
tricks jewelry be repairable so yeah
keep<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.320> mind<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.890> uncut<00:02:48.489> onyx

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
keep that in mind with the uncut onyx

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.570 
keep that in mind with the uncut onyx
and<00:02:49.150> now<00:02:49.690> let's<00:02:49.930> add<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.350> noxious<00:02:50.620> weaponry

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and now let's add the noxious weaponry

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.780 
and now let's add the noxious weaponry
how<00:02:52.030> much<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.360> made<00:02:52.540> from<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.580> total<00:02:54.580> we

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
how much we made from that and total we

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
how much we made from that and total we
made<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.540> point<00:02:56.140> oh<00:02:56.350> five<00:02:56.890> billion<00:02:57.810> that's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
made one point oh five billion that's

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.479 
made one point oh five billion that's
ridiculous<00:02:59.430> that's<00:03:00.430> ridiculous<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:02.489> can't

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
ridiculous that's ridiculous I can't

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.640 
ridiculous that's ridiculous I can't
even<00:03:03.550> believe<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.330> made<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.900> much<00:03:05.200> from

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
even believe that I made this much from

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.610 
even believe that I made this much from
only<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> hundred<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.550> ninety<00:03:06.820> one<00:03:06.970> kills<00:03:07.300> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
only a hundred and ninety one kills I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.789 
only a hundred and ninety one kills I
did<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.800> math<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:10.570> actually<00:03:10.900> works<00:03:11.530> out

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
did the math and this actually works out

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.160 
did the math and this actually works out
to<00:03:11.830> be<00:03:12.870> 5.5<00:03:13.870> million<00:03:14.560> per<00:03:15.070> kill<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:16.170> that's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
to be 5.5 million per kill and that's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.990 
to be 5.5 million per kill and that's
not<00:03:17.410> including<00:03:17.470> instant<00:03:18.280> costs<00:03:18.489> that's<00:03:18.820> not

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
not including instant costs that's not

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.449 
not including instant costs that's not

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
kill for instance it's still 4.8 million

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.150 
kill for instance it's still 4.8 million
per<00:03:31.630> kill<00:03:31.989> that's<00:03:32.739> ridiculous<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.560> believe

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
per kill that's ridiculous and I believe

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.090 
per kill that's ridiculous and I believe
at<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.540> least<00:03:37.900> i'm<00:03:38.260> going<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.530> estimate<00:03:38.680> for

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
at the least i'm going to estimate for

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.170 
at the least i'm going to estimate for
the<00:03:39.370> absolute<00:03:40.000> least<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.660> killed<00:03:41.019> for<00:03:41.380> an<00:03:41.500> hour

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the absolute least I killed for an hour

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.910 
the absolute least I killed for an hour
so<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.360> about<00:03:43.510> nineteen<00:03:44.260> point<00:03:44.680> eight

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
so that's about nineteen point eight

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.310 
so that's about nineteen point eight
million<00:03:45.370> an<00:03:45.640> hour<00:03:45.840> that's<00:03:46.840> better<00:03:47.110> than

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
million an hour that's better than

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.680 
million an hour that's better than
anything<00:03:47.799> else<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.160> this<00:03:48.250> game<00:03:48.519> by<00:03:49.030> far<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
anything else in this game by far and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.810 
anything else in this game by far and
you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.650> still<00:03:50.950> make<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.340> amount<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.760> money

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
you can still make this amount of money

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.640 
you can still make this amount of money
in<00:03:52.090> fact<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.390> can<00:03:52.540> make<00:03:52.720> more<00:03:53.049> than<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.410> now

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
in fact you can make more than this now

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.039 
in fact you can make more than this now
because<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.310> noxious<00:03:54.519> weaponry<00:03:55.480> actually

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
because the noxious weaponry actually

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.800 
because the noxious weaponry actually
went<00:03:56.230> up<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.590> price<00:03:56.620> since<00:03:57.160> I've<00:03:57.340> sold<00:03:57.610> them<00:03:57.850> by

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
went up in price since I've sold them by

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.520 
went up in price since I've sold them by
about<00:03:59.049> 70<00:03:59.560> mil<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.540> total<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:02.049> all<00:04:02.080> three

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
about 70 mil so in total for all three

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.199 
about 70 mil so in total for all three
weapons<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.130> if<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.549> sold<00:04:03.850> them<00:04:03.940> at<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> right

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
weapons if I if I sold them at the right

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:04.650 
weapons if I if I sold them at the right
time

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
time

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.720 
time
would<00:04:04.870> have<00:04:04.960> made<00:04:05.080> 70<00:04:05.470> mil<00:04:05.620> more<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:06.550> can

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
would have made 70 mil more so you can

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.180 
would have made 70 mil more so you can
add<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.510> want<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.680> yeah<00:04:08.860> you<00:04:08.920> can

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
add that if you want so yeah you can

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.890 
add that if you want so yeah you can
still<00:04:09.430> expect<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.030> amount<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.420> money<00:04:10.480> from

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
still expect this amount of money from

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.540 
still expect this amount of money from
here<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.760> I'm<00:04:12.760> saying<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.990> lowest<00:04:14.470> i<00:04:14.770> made

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
here and I'm saying at the lowest i made

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.509 
here and I'm saying at the lowest i made
20<00:04:15.940> mil<00:04:16.090> an<00:04:16.209> hour<00:04:16.360> at<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:17.680> upper<00:04:17.980> range<00:04:18.220> i

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
20 mil an hour at the upper range i

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.570 
20 mil an hour at the upper range i
probably<00:04:18.910> made<00:04:19.239> upwards<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:20.049> 25<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.890> 30<00:04:21.190> mil<00:04:21.430> an

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
probably made upwards of 25 to 30 mil an

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.970 
probably made upwards of 25 to 30 mil an
hour<00:04:21.730> because<00:04:22.480> it's<00:04:22.780> six<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.170> eight<00:04:23.440> kills<00:04:23.770> an

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
hour because it's six to eight kills an

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.190 
hour because it's six to eight kills an
hour<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.430> absolutely<00:04:25.120> plausible<00:04:25.690> impossible

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
hour is absolutely plausible impossible

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.550 
hour is absolutely plausible impossible
and<00:04:26.920> I<00:04:26.980> have<00:04:27.160> done<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.490> before<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:27.960> yeah<00:04:28.960> that's
