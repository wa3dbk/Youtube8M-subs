in<00:00:00.329> early<00:00:00.719> 2012<00:00:01.469> after<00:00:01.920> I'd<00:00:02.040> asked<00:00:02.340> Pat<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.820> be

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
in early 2012 after I'd asked Pat to be

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.820 
in early 2012 after I'd asked Pat to be
a<00:00:02.970> part<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.389> crystals<00:00:03.810> wrath<00:00:04.020> project<00:00:04.620> I

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
a part of the crystals wrath project I

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.220 
a part of the crystals wrath project I
put<00:00:05.310> together<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.730> bass<00:00:06.060> mash<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.629> crash<00:00:06.930> in

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
put together a bass mash of crash in

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.520 
put together a bass mash of crash in
blender<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.610> wasn't<00:00:09.540> really<00:00:09.750> much<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> look<00:00:10.290> at

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
blender it wasn't really much to look at

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.379 
blender it wasn't really much to look at
considering<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.280> not<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> best<00:00:11.759> artist<00:00:12.000> but

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
considering I'm not the best artist but

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.720 
considering I'm not the best artist but
over<00:00:12.599> time<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.259> became<00:00:13.650> more<00:00:13.830> crash<00:00:14.219> looking

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
over time it became more crash looking

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.189 
over time it became more crash looking
the<00:00:15.059> computer<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.690> using<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> time

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the computer I was using at the time

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.439 
the computer I was using at the time
would<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.160> had<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> heart<00:00:17.580> attack<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.150> tried

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
would have had a heart attack if I tried

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.029 
would have had a heart attack if I tried
to<00:00:18.480> run<00:00:18.600> anything<00:00:19.020> more<00:00:19.230> intensive<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
to run anything more intensive and a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
to run anything more intensive and a
really<00:00:20.400> really<00:00:20.430> old<00:00:20.760> version<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.539> blender<00:00:21.750> so

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
really really old version of blender so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.599 
really really old version of blender so
I<00:00:22.380> ended<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.740> sending<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> model<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> Pat

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
I ended up sending the model to Pat

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
I ended up sending the model to Pat
knowing<00:00:24.060> he<00:00:24.210> had<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.510> least<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.810> few<00:00:24.990> years

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
knowing he had at least a few years

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.990 
knowing he had at least a few years
experience<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.160> 3dsmax

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
experience in 3dsmax

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849 
experience in 3dsmax
we<00:00:27.210> collaborated<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> together<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.740> he

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
we collaborated on it together as he

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.380 
we collaborated on it together as he
cleaned<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> model<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> made<00:00:30.179> more

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cleaned up the model and made more

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
cleaned up the model and made more
tweaks<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.470> idea<00:00:31.769> where<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> hell

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
tweaks and I have no idea where the hell

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.030 
tweaks and I have no idea where the hell
this<00:00:32.790> fit<00:00:33.180> into<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> process<00:00:33.600> eventually<00:00:34.410> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this fit into the process eventually we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
this fit into the process eventually we
ended<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.460> an<00:00:35.550> unwrapped<00:00:35.969> textured

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
ended up with an unwrapped textured

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
ended up with an unwrapped textured
rigged<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> animatable<00:00:37.920> crash<00:00:38.219> model<00:00:38.640> which

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
rigged and animatable crash model which

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
rigged and animatable crash model which
was<00:00:38.940> capable<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.329> doing<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.469> zany

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
was capable of doing all the zany

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.940 
was capable of doing all the zany
cartoon<00:00:41.690> stuff<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.960> wanted<00:00:43.260> crash<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.829> able

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
cartoon stuff we wanted crash to be able

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
cartoon stuff we wanted crash to be able
to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.059> decided<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> run<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to do so we decided to run with it this

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.660 
to do so we decided to run with it this
was<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.800> model<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> used<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
was the first model to be used in the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
was the first model to be used in the
actual<00:00:47.879> playable<00:00:48.539> game<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.469> remained<00:00:49.890> there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
actual playable game it remained there

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
actual playable game it remained there
for<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.640> while<00:00:51.020> but<00:00:52.020> after<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.980> time<00:00:53.010> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
for a while but after some time we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
for a while but after some time we
started<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> lose<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.660> faith<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> model

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
started to lose our faith in the model

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:08.720 
started to lose our faith in the model
we<00:00:55.949> decided<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.600> sucked

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.370 

yeah<00:01:09.760> after<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> while<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:10.870> began<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.290> there

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
yeah after a while we began and there

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.780 
yeah after a while we began and there
was<00:01:11.470> all<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.740> stupid<00:01:12.250> things<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.670> were

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
was all the stupid things that were

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.850 
was all the stupid things that were
wrong<00:01:12.970> with<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.300> original<00:01:13.390> model<00:01:14.050> for<00:01:14.710> one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
wrong with the original model for one

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.930 
wrong with the original model for one
thing<00:01:15.070> they<00:01:15.190> were<00:01:15.280> just<00:01:15.430> way<00:01:15.610> too<00:01:15.670> many

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
thing they were just way too many

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.060 
thing they were just way too many
polygons<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.840> what<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.080> was<00:01:17.230> for<00:01:17.830> something

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
polygons for what it was for something

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.950 
polygons for what it was for something
dumb<00:01:18.250> reason<00:01:18.700> we<00:01:18.850> actually<00:01:19.210> decided<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.690> use

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
dumb reason we actually decided to use

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.950 
dumb reason we actually decided to use
full<00:01:20.350> spheres<00:01:20.950> for<00:01:21.250> crashes<00:01:21.700> eyes<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:22.300> have<00:01:22.690> no

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
full spheres for crashes eyes I have no

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.690 
full spheres for crashes eyes I have no
idea<00:01:23.410> why<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.710> didn't<00:01:24.010> see<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> problem<00:01:24.610> with

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
idea why I didn't see a problem with

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.760 
idea why I didn't see a problem with
that<00:01:24.880> at<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.090> time<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:25.930> resulted<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.590> there

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
that at the time this resulted in there

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.650 
that at the time this resulted in there
being<00:01:26.980> about<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.250> thousand<00:01:27.850> polygons<00:01:28.360> more

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
being about a thousand polygons more

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.510 
being about a thousand polygons more
than<00:01:28.840> there<00:01:28.990> needed<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.320> be<00:01:29.410> not<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.340> mention

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
than there needed to be not to mention

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340 
than there needed to be not to mention
the<00:01:30.790> terrible<00:01:31.180> edge<00:01:31.360> flow<00:01:31.750> around<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> rest

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the terrible edge flow around the rest

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.690 
the terrible edge flow around the rest
of<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.530> model<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.220> ridiculously

of the model and the ridiculously

of the model and the ridiculously

generally creepy vibe from looking at
him<00:01:54.360> though<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.480> was<00:01:55.630> painful<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:56.380> felt<00:01:56.650> that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
him though it was painful we felt that

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.190 
him though it was painful we felt that
we<00:01:56.860> had<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.430> redo<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.790> model<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.870> learned<00:01:59.110> a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
we had to redo the model we learned a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.720 
we had to redo the model we learned a
lot<00:01:59.350> after<00:01:59.680> getting<00:01:59.920> our<00:02:00.040> first<00:02:00.250> model<00:02:00.640> of

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
lot after getting our first model of

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.670 
lot after getting our first model of
crash<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.300> engine<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.780> we<00:02:02.140> knew<00:02:02.320> we<00:02:02.500> could

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
crash in the engine and we knew we could

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680 
crash in the engine and we knew we could
already<00:02:02.860> do<00:02:03.310> better<00:02:03.580> we<00:02:04.150> spent<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.510> few<00:02:04.630> days

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
already do better we spent a few days

looking<00:02:05.260> at<00:02:05.380> references<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.070> every<00:02:06.280> crash

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
looking at references of every crash

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.430 
looking at references of every crash
model<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.120> tried<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.690> choose<00:02:08.020> what<00:02:08.320> we

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
model and tried to choose what we

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.020 
model and tried to choose what we
thought<00:02:08.679> were<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.950> best<00:02:09.040> features<00:02:09.730> of<00:02:09.760> each

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
thought were the best features of each

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420 
thought were the best features of each
and<00:02:10.420> combine<00:02:10.720> them<00:02:10.960> our<00:02:11.440> new<00:02:11.680> crash<00:02:11.980> model

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and combine them our new crash model

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.310 
and combine them our new crash model
slowly<00:02:12.700> began<00:02:13.000> taking<00:02:13.300> shape<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.990> started

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
slowly began taking shape as I started

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.170 
slowly began taking shape as I started
roughing<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.830> together<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.760> add<00:02:15.910> some

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
roughing it together I would add some

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.870 
roughing it together I would add some
geometry<00:02:16.510> move<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.410> around<00:02:17.500> send<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.580> Jamie

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
geometry move it around send it to Jamie

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.090 
geometry move it around send it to Jamie
he'd<00:02:19.420> move<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.720> around<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.530> signed<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.860> back

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
he'd move it around but signed it back

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460 
he'd move it around but signed it back
and<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.820> process<00:02:22.330> continued<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.260> that

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and the process continued on like that

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.320 
and the process continued on like that
for<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.770> most<00:02:23.890> part<00:02:24.040> once<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> shape<00:02:25.120> was

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
for the most part once the shape was

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.610 
for the most part once the shape was
good<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.750> only<00:02:25.870> technically<00:02:26.380> about<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
good it was only technically about a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.220 
good it was only technically about a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230

the<00:02:57.040> crash<00:02:57.250> model<00:02:57.700> brought<00:02:57.910> up<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.300> overall

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
the crash model brought up the overall

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.930 
the crash model brought up the overall
quality<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.290> game<00:02:59.530> immensely<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.670> liked

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
quality of the game immensely we liked

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.180 
quality of the game immensely we liked
it<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.260> whatever<00:03:02.980> that's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
it and if you don't in whatever that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.740 
it and if you don't in whatever that's
cool<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:04.030> we<00:03:04.150> really<00:03:04.330> don't<00:03:04.480> feel<00:03:04.660> like

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
cool but we really don't feel like

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.540 
cool but we really don't feel like
changing<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.380> again<00:03:05.680> it's<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.130> lot<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.310> hard

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
