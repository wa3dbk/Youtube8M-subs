that's not rubra treatment it's a radio

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.930 
that's not rubra treatment it's a radio
frequency<00:06:11.110> device<00:06:11.830> that<00:06:12.130> tightens<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.700> neck

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
frequency device that tightens the neck

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.450 
frequency device that tightens the neck
