00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 so hello dear friends and warmly 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome to the fifth part of the reality 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.750
 in series 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.840
 here on youtube we have today as well 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 again some nice articles but that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 keller youth taken to cellar and magna 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:29.789
 volcanoes from leslie brook recker from 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.290
 Area with the light passenger car on the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.800
 back manufacturer intel hjs georg 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.710
 judge, let's see, these are men 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:54.320
 with green luthe, however, thick 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 The wall will look very beautiful 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 tidy times think the same time 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 compared to the cracker from keller 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.549
 Here, too, could take a look at the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.750
 back throw green backcover yes 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.290
 otherwise there is nothing to say 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:26.390
 baykal turns off a few formations 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:26.390
 the backcover dollar is seen from it 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.590
 green-white then with gray sliver and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 clay but also experience 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.990
 because he is always extreme 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990
 loud 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:52.229
 the louder ones than those of so many people 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.200
 Now we are out for two months 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.329
 at poker it really is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.679
 real rain forces but it is heart 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.850
 and I had to do that today 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.789
 I can not move either 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.989
 choose 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.540
 Green was the best thing to do 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.540
 in the basement 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 yes but that was to be expected of course 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.310
 with such a wonderful weather being there 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.310
 she is even whole 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.260
 not at all 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.570
 two years, we still see it at all 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.110
 do not turn it off, maybe that's it 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.360
 a reason 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.290
 I still may get up 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.290
 the stones required 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.510
 that has nothing to do with the rain, then 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.180
 to people who want to write this here 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.160
 move on and on as far as I can 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.160
 always like to put in the almost dry 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.790
 you see 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.790
 you can not do anything that does not look 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.090
 Let's continue with the audience 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 hammergeil bang and because the others 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.280
 there is no such thing 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.280
 for you a second one 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:16.250
 mum volcano of leslie from this 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:19.040
 play class 1 series came only in the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.900
 Netherlands to the state and then too 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.900
 to germany with approval 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.370
 I do not think so 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:43.430
 so we have a red and yes 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:44.090
 not a green one either 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.180
 stated 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.850
 it is really successful with one 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.380
 Increase here the eruption surface and 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.850
 thus also in the position of the post over 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:03.800
 actually ever convince the 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:09.699
 can leslie magma volcanoes in red and 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.699
 Green only on with the in red 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.510
 very cool part wonderful have that 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.490
 Feeling he was a bit pink 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.200
 but always not sure 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.620
 but find here now to the 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.620
 green 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.380
 there has probably the people must 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.610
 switched off 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.690
 just him was still on now 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.660
 that's why unfortunately now 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.650
 I'm really sorry for that 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.720
 I can tell you something really nice 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.530
 so and now last but not least the china 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:31.370
 bÃ¶ller von cellars green-white backcover 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:38.180
 just like the kloker you can see 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:40.100
 already further bÃ¶ller and that after the 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.770
 same principle as the flugretter 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.020
 processed so worthwhile gray one sees 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.020
 here already reddish through the clay 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.070
 thus his keen good 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.940
 So, of course, not change 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.680
 compare with current pictures but 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.440
 at a time this is 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.690
 deterioration of the china bollards 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:10.250
 So it has looked like blankets 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:15.680
 so and now last but not least here in the 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:18.850
 darkened by the light got the 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.850
 but of it cellar 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.820
 was already good but better presented 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.979
 he was not good 

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:52.709
 pity so this rarities series was 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:55.139
 then not so much the berner but one 

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:59.359
 fifth or sixth part i believe 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:59.359
 I'm sure there will be again
