00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
actually chat in IRC mode and if you're

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700 
actually chat in IRC mode and if you're
wondering<00:00:22.710> why<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.699> happens<00:00:24.330> I'll<00:00:25.230> tell<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
wondering why this happens I'll tell you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.000 
wondering why this happens I'll tell you
so<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:27.029> pretty<00:00:27.420> much<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.410> happened<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> me

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
so I'm pretty much this happened to me

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.540 
so I'm pretty much this happened to me
all<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> times<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.410> what<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> found<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
all the times and what I found out is

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.170 
all the times and what I found out is
that<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:36.000> either

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that it is actually because you either

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.830 
that it is actually because you either
set<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> prefix<00:00:37.219> user<00:00:38.219> setup<00:00:38.550> prefix<00:00:39.090> well<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
set a prefix user setup prefix well you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.959 
set a prefix user setup prefix well you
probably<00:00:40.079> set<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> prefix<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.850> why

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
probably set a prefix and that is why

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.350 
probably set a prefix and that is why
it's<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.420> working<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.350> resilience

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's not working because of resilience

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
it's not working because of resilience
unit<00:00:45.360> set<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> prefix<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.770> pretty<00:00:47.010> sure<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
unit set a prefix I'm pretty sure you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
unit set a prefix I'm pretty sure you
need<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> donate<00:00:47.940> correct<00:00:48.899> me<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.350> wrong

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
need to donate correct me if I'm wrong

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.360 
need to donate correct me if I'm wrong
but<00:00:50.750> yeah<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.500> happening<00:00:52.920> because

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
but yeah I think it's happening because

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
but yeah I think it's happening because
you<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> prefix<00:00:54.480> pretty<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:54.899> um<00:00:56.960> we

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you have a prefix pretty much um we

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.180 
you have a prefix pretty much um we
don't<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.230> why<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.440> happens<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
