what wetting the brush actually does is

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
what wetting the brush actually does is
allows<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.870> pigment<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:41.059> become

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
allows the pigment to really become

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
allows the pigment to really become
vivid<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.079> moisture<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:44.160> know<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
vivid that moisture I don't know the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.020 
vivid that moisture I don't know the
exact<00:00:45.620> chemical<00:00:46.620> properties<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:47.789> anything

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
exact chemical properties or anything

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
exact chemical properties or anything
how<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> occurs<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.700> basically<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> allows

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
how it occurs but basically it allows

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
how it occurs but basically it allows
that<00:00:51.449> moisture<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.320> pigment<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:55.129> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that moisture that pigment to kind of it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
that moisture that pigment to kind of it
makes<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.149> vibrant<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> I'm<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.379> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
take that and just apply that to the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.609 
take that and just apply that to the
outer<00:01:43.439> corner<00:01:44.159> she<00:01:44.970> already<00:01:45.090> has<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
outer corner she already has some on but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.870 
outer corner she already has some on but
I'm<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> darken<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> I'm

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm just going to darken it and I'm

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'm just going to darken it and I'm
going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.810> apply<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> crease

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
going to also apply that to the crease

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.959 
going to also apply that to the crease
and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:51.500> almost<00:01:52.500> wing<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> bit<00:01:54.470> um

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
and then almost wing it out a bit um

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
and then almost wing it out a bit um
just<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.149> something<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.990> something<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
just so something it's something that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.789 
just so something it's something that
the<00:01:58.770> winged<00:01:58.979> eyeliner<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.880> almost<00:02:00.509> follow<00:02:00.799> so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the winged eyeliner can almost follow so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
the winged eyeliner can almost follow so
then<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.649> to
