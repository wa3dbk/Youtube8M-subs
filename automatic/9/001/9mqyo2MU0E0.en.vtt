interacting<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.820> them<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
interacting with them this was a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
interacting with them this was a
frustration<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.830> money<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.480> not

frustration of money and it was not
really<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.410> solution<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> market<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.820> was

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
really a solution on the market that was

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810 
really a solution on the market that was
available<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.510> fix<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:38.100> decided<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> we

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
available to fix it we decided that we

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450 
available to fix it we decided that we
were<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> address<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.309> two<00:00:41.309> years

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
were going to address that two years

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
were going to address that two years
later<00:00:41.629> about<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> product

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
later about we actually have a product

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
later about we actually have a product
now<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.090> feel<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.989> solution

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
now that we feel that is that solution

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910 
now that we feel that is that solution
the<00:00:47.520> patented<00:00:48.030> coating<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.410> surface<00:00:49.440> of

the patented coating on the surface of
your<00:00:50.070> masks<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.329> gives<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> grip<00:00:52.170> match

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
your masks is what gives the grip match

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.790 
your masks is what gives the grip match
its<00:00:52.890> crepiness<00:00:53.280> its<00:00:54.030> grippy<00:00:54.539> cannot<00:00:54.989> stay<00:00:55.289> as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you can see here grip max surface makes

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
you can see here grip max surface makes
a<00:00:58.680> large<00:00:58.920> difference<00:00:59.370> versus<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> normal<00:01:00.480> wood
