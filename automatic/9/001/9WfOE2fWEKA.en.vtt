00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with a 50 caliber with acog scope so I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.779 
with a 50 caliber with acog scope so I
figured<00:00:28.830> I'd<00:00:29.130> give<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> shot<00:00:29.519> check<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
figured I'd give it a shot check this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.790 
figured I'd give it a shot check this
out<00:00:30.050> double<00:00:31.050> kill<00:00:31.850> it's<00:00:32.850> frag<00:00:33.059> grenade<00:00:33.800> yeah

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
out double kill it's frag grenade yeah

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
out double kill it's frag grenade yeah
and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:36.090> pretty<00:00:36.239> damn<00:00:36.480> successful<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and so it's pretty damn successful the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
and so it's pretty damn successful the
ACOG<00:00:37.440> scope<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.399> um<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.210> post

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
ACOG scope and I think also um if I post

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
ACOG scope and I think also um if I post
up<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.809> cod<00:00:40.079> six<00:00:40.350> videos<00:00:40.710> where<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> obviously

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
up some cod six videos where I obviously

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.229 
up some cod six videos where I obviously
am<00:00:42.059> showing<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:43.350> skill<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> cod6<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
am showing my skill and cod6 I think it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
am showing my skill and cod6 I think it
gives<00:00:45.450> me<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:47.660> little<00:00:48.660> bit<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.989> disclaimer<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
gives me a little bit of a disclaimer so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400 
gives me a little bit of a disclaimer so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
screwed over because earlier in this vid

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.020 
screwed over because earlier in this vid
i<00:03:11.560> kept<00:03:11.830> my<00:03:11.920> predator<00:03:12.220> missile<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.790> then<00:03:12.970> I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
i kept my predator missile and then I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.940 
i kept my predator missile and then I
was<00:03:13.150> getting<00:03:13.330> shot<00:03:13.510> out<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:14.560> noobish

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
was getting shot out and really noobish

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.620 
was getting shot out and really noobish
Lee<00:03:15.130> sat<00:03:15.400> down<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.790> some<00:03:15.970> brush<00:03:16.209> thinking

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
Lee sat down and some brush thinking

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.120 
Lee sat down and some brush thinking
that<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.810> wouldn't<00:03:17.110> get<00:03:17.200> chased<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.890> killed

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
that I wouldn't get chased and killed

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.040 
that I wouldn't get chased and killed
thinking<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.910> my<00:03:19.060> teammates<00:03:19.450> would<00:03:19.660> protect

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
thinking that my teammates would protect

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.160 
thinking that my teammates would protect
me<00:03:20.140> or<00:03:20.290> something<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:21.090> wait<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.959> am<00:03:23.080> I

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
so if you call in another yoy be on top

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.059 
so if you call in another yoy be on top
of<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:10.000> UAV<00:04:10.239> that's<00:04:10.540> already<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.830> think

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
of a UAV that's already up and you think

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.030 
of a UAV that's already up and you think
like<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.580> was<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> big<00:04:12.940> fail

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
like that was a big fail

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.830 
like that was a big fail
that<00:04:14.640> right<00:04:14.879> there<00:04:15.090> was<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> way<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.540> what<00:04:15.750> you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
that right there was a way in what you

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.080 
that right there was a way in what you
just<00:04:15.989> saw<00:04:16.139> on<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.320> screen<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:16.850> back<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
just saw on the screen but back to the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.610 
just saw on the screen but back to the
UAV<00:04:18.419> son<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.810> bitch<00:04:18.959> cause<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.350> keep<00:04:19.470> on

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
UAV son of bitch cause you keep on

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.289 
UAV son of bitch cause you keep on
getting<00:04:19.829> distracted<00:04:20.070> trying<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.120> talk<00:04:21.209> about

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
getting distracted trying to talk about

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.170 
getting distracted trying to talk about
me<00:04:21.449> UAVs<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:22.639> what<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.729> does<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.120> it

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
me UAVs here what it does is it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.749 
me UAVs here what it does is it
increases<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:24.990> speed<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.740> UAV<00:04:26.190> scan<00:04:26.520> and

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
increases the speed of the UAV scan and

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.490 
increases the speed of the UAV scan and
so<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.240> not<00:04:27.330> really<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.600> big<00:04:27.720> fail<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.259> just

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
so it's not really a big fail it's just

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.040 
so it's not really a big fail it's just
you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.340> what<00:04:29.789> you<00:04:29.880> prefer<00:04:30.000> in<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
you know what you prefer in the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.080 
you know what you prefer in the
advantage<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.560> increasing<00:04:32.130> your<00:04:32.250> UAV<00:04:32.610> screen

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
advantage of increasing your UAV screen

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.230 
advantage of increasing your UAV screen
or<00:04:33.330> scan<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.370> know<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.580> gives<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.880> more

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
or scan is that you know it gives a more

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.090 
or scan is that you know it gives a more
accurate<00:04:36.449> reading<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.050> where<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.740> enemy<00:04:38.070> is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
accurate reading of where the enemy is

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.460 
accurate reading of where the enemy is
as<00:04:38.460> they're<00:04:38.850> moving<00:04:38.880> around<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> map<00:04:39.470> because

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
as they're moving around the map because

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.110 
as they're moving around the map because
remember<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.919> UAV<00:04:41.220> when<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.490> passes<00:04:41.699> over<00:04:41.940> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
remember the UAV when it passes over it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.840 
remember the UAV when it passes over it
a<00:04:42.389> guy<00:04:42.810> could<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.110> sprinting<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.759> know
