00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 we are in this video to see how 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.480
 we managed to unlock all the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.840
 corners of the sun the first thing you have 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 what to do is download the program what 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.809
 you will have in the description of the video in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.490
 the received to the mega server would be 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.490
 put the whole description 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 or what weekly downloads kings as a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570
 Once downloaded you will have it in our 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 download folders if you have not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.050
 changed I have it here we are going to close 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.590
 we make them with the desk so that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 you see it all 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.079
 extract in the skins and worth having a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.890
 folder we click inside and the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.879
 operation is very simple 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 we apply twice will ask us to go back to 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.739
 activate the program since it has now 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 got the old skins that had 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 where we apply again and asks for you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.080
 Please select the folder where 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 have the riot me how has changed 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.940
 for lack of space I have it inside 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 the books legends hours inside here 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.229
 would be configuration road the session 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 shots by the before league of legends 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.179
 this is that the user stops here for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 play then we have to go say 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.700
 flames we select the folder and we 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.250
 this screen comes out this screen is what 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.509
 that we are going to use can be 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 the new skins old skins are you 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.640
 for example they are eliminated 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.729
 another one that is also deleted and you see 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 very clearly is the singer here the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.130
 we eliminated since 1 from 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 season 2 at the end season 2 I think what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.039
 gave this the singlist 9 and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.530
 possibly the other k 9 that I do not know 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.509
 agreement now who was also and nothing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.509
 very simple you open the roll 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.730
 good to corroborate that you do not have 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.630
 that corner so nobody says luiz and 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.149
 then it does not work is that I already had 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.929
 let's make everything clear 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.929
 leave me 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.740
 OK 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.470
 to unlock 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:25.410
 unlock unlock on property in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 the case of having one that is not in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.020
 sale would come out like for example I do not know 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.020
 now very well who had 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.370
 I think they were geimer ok I do not think the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.120
 teacher and teacher and there was one that the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.340
 they withdrew 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 in property unlock unlock 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.290
 unlock and develop 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 They have not changed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.959
 here we can see several skins now that 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.959
 they have retouched them all and such 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.710
 they do where we have 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.950
 I dont know 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.930
 unlock lock and unlock but 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.930
 then you come here do 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.930
 and yellow jacket and ice 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.209
 I do not have them either 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.280
 ok I've done these checks I'm going to 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.120
 make a custom to make it more 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.120
 Quick 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 add a little rhythm we start 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.480
 to see if you do not follow 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.000
 to the seventh 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.260
 a demonstration of criteria add to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.390
 we chose them 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.239
 correctly we verify that no 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.439
 I can use other types of skins for 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.439
 example I'm going to put 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.870
 not the secretariat but really 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.120
 we are going to play with the other sanz 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.739
 this is really just visual for the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.739
 person who has the program 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.140
 well with him from the visual I 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.670
 I mean this 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.989
 as you can see in the photo 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:25.220
 previous left as was 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.500
 of blue as this photo is as is 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.870
 It would be the normal sim as a classic 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 you want to call and this is in jacket 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.990
 yellow 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.759
 the difference is quite obvious the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.009
 visual refers to who only has 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.070
 the program will be able to see 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.440
 those that changed 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.700
 so also that I can close that the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.500
 animations are still those of the 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.940
 main other than what scene 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.310
 the animations will change but in case 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.360
 perhaps also say what is never of 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.000
 wrong 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.039
 and well up to here the video I hope that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.960
 I liked that you enjoy it a lot 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.729
 that not six errors that give us errors 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.280
 since if you have another program that 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.310
 also interact with the skins is 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.890
 possible that this program does not work for you 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.610
 but for the rest all the colleagues that 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.730
 for now they have it going perfect - 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.290
 just one and that's why I discovered it 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.600
 it's not because of having another 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.840
 program that touches the skins 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.250
 more than saying the former subscribe and leave 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.250
 comments if you want to see you later
