00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
edges I stopped the so ends and now I

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.310 
edges I stopped the so ends and now I
just<00:01:57.340> deep<00:01:57.700> condition<00:01:58.149> my<00:01:58.179> hair<00:01:58.539> every<00:01:59.079> week

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320

and<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.039> treat<00:02:00.310> my<00:02:00.429> edges<00:02:00.789> as<00:02:00.939> if<00:02:01.119> there<00:02:01.329> are

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
and I treat my edges as if there are

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.739 
and I treat my edges as if there are
ends<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.499> they're<00:02:02.679> really<00:02:02.859> fragile

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
ends because they're really fragile

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.149 
ends because they're really fragile
regardless<00:02:04.749> if<00:02:05.049> you<00:02:05.259> have<00:02:05.289> great<00:02:05.710> hair<00:02:05.979> now

your<00:02:06.399> edges<00:02:06.759> are<00:02:06.909> really<00:02:07.060> fragile<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.259> deep

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
your edges are really fragile so I deep

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.490 
your edges are really fragile so I deep
condition<00:02:08.679> those<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.869> moisturize<00:02:10.869> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
condition those and I moisturize and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.119
