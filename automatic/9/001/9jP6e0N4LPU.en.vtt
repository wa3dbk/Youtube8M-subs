the collar is the key part of the system

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.779 
the collar is the key part of the system
and<00:00:15.960> what's<00:00:16.410> neat<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.650> tri<00:00:17.070> tronic<00:00:17.430> systems

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and what's neat about tri tronic systems

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.790 
and what's neat about tri tronic systems
is<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> field<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.869> proline<00:00:19.289> they

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
is that in the field and proline they

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620 
is that in the field and proline they
use<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> exact<00:00:20.369> same<00:00:20.460> collar<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.359> start<00:00:21.570> off

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
use the exact same collar you start off

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540 
use the exact same collar you start off
with<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> classic<00:00:21.930> 70<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> way<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
exact same collar one of my favorite

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.960 
exact same collar one of my favorite
things<00:00:28.410> about<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:29.010> particular<00:00:29.519> system<00:00:29.730> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
things about this particular system is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.810 
things about this particular system is
the<00:00:30.570> design<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> battery<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> look

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the design of the battery if you look

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
the design of the battery if you look
closely<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.600> system<00:00:33.960> there's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> split

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
closely at this system there's a split

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520 
closely at this system there's a split
in<00:00:35.489> between<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:36.570> top<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> collar<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in between the top of the collar and the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
in between the top of the collar and the
bottom<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> collar<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
bottom of the collar and that's the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.830 
bottom of the collar and that's the
battery<00:00:40.340> unlike<00:00:41.340> every<00:00:42.090> other<00:00:42.180> system<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
battery unlike every other system on the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.670 
battery unlike every other system on the
market<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.879> two<00:00:45.059> parts<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.690> separate

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
market the the two parts are separate

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
market the the two parts are separate
pieces<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.030> completely

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pieces and so they are completely

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900 
pieces and so they are completely
independently<00:00:49.140> waterproof<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
independently waterproof so when you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
independently waterproof so when you
have<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> switch<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.420> battery<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.829> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
have to switch a battery out you do not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
have to switch a battery out you do not
open<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> system<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> see

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
open up the system you don't get to see

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
open up the system you don't get to see
the<00:00:54.840> electronics<00:00:55.410> there's<00:00:55.649> no<00:00:55.829> circuit<00:00:56.370> board

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the electronics there's no circuit board

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
the electronics there's no circuit board
anything<00:00:57.000> along<00:00:57.149> those<00:00:57.329> lines<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.050> two

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
anything along those lines it's just two

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.400 
anything along those lines it's just two
separate<00:00:58.710> pieces<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.420> that's<00:01:00.420> great

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
separate pieces and that's great

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
separate pieces and that's great
they<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.250> makes<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.149> more

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
they just makes them a little bit more

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
they just makes them a little bit more
dependable<00:01:03.870> always<00:01:04.680> makes<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:05.010> nervous<00:01:05.159> when

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
dependable always makes me nervous when

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
dependable always makes me nervous when
I'm<00:01:05.580> switching<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.180> battery<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> collar

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I'm switching out a battery on a collar

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
I'm switching out a battery on a collar
I<00:01:07.619> open<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I open it up and I can see all the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
I open it up and I can see all the
insides<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.590> care

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
insides of it I just really don't care

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.870 
insides of it I just really don't care
for<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> things

for that so that's one of the things

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
for that so that's one of the things
about<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> EXP<00:01:12.600> receiver<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> personally

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
about the EXP receiver that I personally

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.990 
about the EXP receiver that I personally
like<00:01:14.220> pretty<00:01:15.030> simple<00:01:15.420> device<00:01:15.680> you've<00:01:16.680> got

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
set up where they'll switch out on

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109 
set up where they'll switch out on
pretty<00:01:22.409> much<00:01:22.530> any<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> glow<00:01:23.340> style<00:01:23.729> straps

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.300 
pretty much any of the glow style straps
that<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> thin

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
straps so some of the dog collars we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
straps so some of the dog collars we
sell<00:01:28.140> aren't<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.439> fit<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.460> majority
