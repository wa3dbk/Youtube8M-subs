00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.240
 talk about the plot seems to remind 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.280
 discussion of the game of thrones is the controversy of those 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.710
 who read and who did not read but more often 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.480
 disputes between those who read cd projekt 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.700
 red has shown at last commemorated cheese and 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.199
 told me that she was driven by a wild hunt 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.880
 don't rush quotes sapkovsky and 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.529
 say what's the end screenwriters 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.960
 may well put your reading 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.730
 In a pool of 2 and 3 in a row the main shows 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.769
 Witcher you passes behind closed doors 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.840
 get to know the tracks the audience saw a bit 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.879
 gameplay and it became clear why its not 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.920
 showed firstly the game still has 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.960
 problems jams texture general brakes 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.489
 and minor bugs someone even noticed that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.769
 herald's hair sways wrong 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.390
 short demos were enough to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.860
 delight did not have time to switch to everything 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.780
 this with a generally amazing graphics 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.610
 life itself and projekt red says that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.379
 the game is ready ahead of almost a year on 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.059
 optimization of fixing minor issues 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.159
 do not worry in the first two 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.780
 Parts also had bugs and this did not stop 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.970
 the witcher is estimated to live becoming a cult 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.350
 the part must come out even better 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.540
 if not for the first time, a giant open 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.019
 the world and for the first time just four platforms on 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.150
 start up 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.920
 secondly but strangely a demonstration 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.140
 Witcher 3 gameplay was not at all 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.390
 are needed and that is good because they also 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.220
 don't need for example any gt rockstar yes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.470
 long understood and replaced long smoke on 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.570
 beautiful tourist cuts any 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.700
 side quest lasts at least 40 minutes 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.320
 only one possible branch as 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.240
 it takes transition by locations difficult 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.800
 imagine so it happened that even 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.170
 fifteen minute show nothing 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.940
 breaks but any piece of gameplay new 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.590
 Witcher with e3 very clearly conveys 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.110
 sensations of the gigantic scale of the game 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.880
 for example at the edge of tex 12 minutes fit 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 all the basics to you in the revolution 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.930
 ubisoft 6 minutes rainbow six siege 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 there are all the main patterns of which 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.250
 will consist of the game nothing witch 3 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 these numbers do not fit therefore 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 we have only the beginning of something 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.110
 mysterious in the marshes piece of the quest 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.270
 about griffin hunting and walking 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 extreme nova all together is minutes 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.659
 at twenty who give nothing unless 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.729
 what delight of graphics feeling 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.770
 giant scale except possible 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.600
 call the combat system and then hardly from 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.620
 spoils the overall impression but she can 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.810
 add a spoon of tar 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.640
 developers praised dark souls abay 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.710
 similar to assassin's creed fixing 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 on targets weak strong block attacks and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.470
 counter-strike unless you need to tumble 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.000
 as much as sauce 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.100
 from geralt to slowdown can choose 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 few spells but judging too early 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.150
 since the witcher stocks still powerful 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.010
 role system a huge city of Novi Grad 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.720
 which one is already several times larger 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.670
 the entire skyrim showed only 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.230
 the very outskirts he looks alive 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.820
 developers say that designers 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.920
 thought out the location of everything 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.080
 until each tree so all 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.760
 unique made by hand in the city 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.300
 four districts and every resident is busy 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.550
 by doing 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 this place is teeming with quests that way or 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 otherwise connected if you take one 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
 the other will disappear and the third will change 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.290
 so the developers are warning that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.760
 we must always think what you are doing a little 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860
 used to say that the witcher even in 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 rush for 100 hours is good 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.280
 because sit on project 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.340
 will no longer make games it will come out 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.340
 February 2015 even Sobinbank 2077
