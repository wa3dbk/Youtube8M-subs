leave some of it in there because it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.759

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
and everything that belongs in a pond so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.810 
and everything that belongs in a pond so
basically<00:01:09.770> what<00:01:09.980> I<00:01:10.010> do<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:10.400> drain<00:01:10.730> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
basically what I do is I just drain the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.750 
basically what I do is I just drain the
pond<00:01:11.030> down<00:01:11.320> pull<00:01:12.320> all<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.710> leaves<00:01:13.220> out<00:01:13.520> all

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760

pond down pull all the leaves out all
the<00:01:14.000> leaves<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.540> debris<00:01:14.900> that's<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the leaves and debris that's in the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.790 
the leaves and debris that's in the
bottom<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.860> pond<00:01:16.070> ultimately<00:01:16.729> become<00:01:17.800> for

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
bottom of the pond ultimately become for

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.160 
bottom of the pond ultimately become for
the<00:01:18.860> compost<00:01:19.280> there's<00:01:20.180> already<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.870> lot<00:01:20.990> of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the compost there's already a lot of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.930 
the compost there's already a lot of
beneficial<00:01:21.650> bacteria<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.370> stuff<00:01:22.610> that's<00:01:22.850> on

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
beneficial bacteria and stuff that's on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.240 
beneficial bacteria and stuff that's on
the<00:01:23.180> stuff<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.890> makes<00:01:25.040> really

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
the stuff and it just it makes really

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.200 
the stuff and it just it makes really
good<00:01:25.460> compost<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:28.250> isn't<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.670> prettiest

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
good compost this isn't the prettiest

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.110 
good compost this isn't the prettiest
job<00:01:29.390> in<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.660> world<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:30.820> think<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.970> average

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
job in the world I think the average

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.390 
job in the world I think the average
person<00:01:32.720> if<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:33.500> were<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.710> jump<00:01:33.950> into<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.160> pond

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
person if they were to jump into a pond

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.330 
person if they were to jump into a pond
like<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.740> would<00:01:36.860> probably<00:01:37.010> make<00:01:37.190> them

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
like this it would probably make them

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.660 
like this it would probably make them
sick<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:38.860> sometimes<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.980> think<00:01:40.040> I'm<00:01:40.310> immune<00:01:40.640> to

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
sick I sometimes I think I'm immune to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.080 
sick I sometimes I think I'm immune to
it<00:01:40.940> because<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.360> did<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.960> doesn't<00:01:42.260> faze<00:01:42.440> me<00:01:42.470> any

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
it because it did it doesn't faze me any

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.450 
it because it did it doesn't faze me any
I<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.810> grew<00:01:45.080> up<00:01:45.200> around<00:01:45.350> water<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.100> you

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
I just I grew up around water and you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.340 
I just I grew up around water and you
know<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.670> whole<00:01:46.820> low<00:01:47.060> tide<00:01:47.330> thing<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.110> you

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
know the whole low tide thing and you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.870 
know the whole low tide thing and you
know<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.530> smell<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.550> just<00:01:49.700> absolutely

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
know the smell and and I just absolutely

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.810 
know the smell and and I just absolutely
love<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:51.380> guess<00:01:52.100> that's<00:01:52.280> why<00:01:52.400> I'm<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.610> crazy

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
love it I guess that's why I'm a crazy

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.410 
love it I guess that's why I'm a crazy
fish<00:01:53.060> farmer<00:01:53.410> anyhow<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.210> seen

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
fish farmer anyhow so what you just seen

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.920 
fish farmer anyhow so what you just seen
there<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.190> salamander<00:01:58.190> I've<00:01:58.490> got<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:59.000> lot<00:01:59.900> of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
there was a salamander I've got a lot of

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.660 
there was a salamander I've got a lot of
different<00:02:00.290> type<00:02:00.440> salamanders<00:02:01.130> around<00:02:01.400> here

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
different type salamanders around here

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.700 
different type salamanders around here
and<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.720> probably<00:02:02.960> need<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.230> start<00:02:03.470> documenting

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and I probably need to start documenting

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.670 
and I probably need to start documenting
some<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.790> them<00:02:04.910> because<00:02:05.410> some<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.440> them<00:02:06.620> are

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
some of them because some of them are

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
our water systems are getting polluted

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.210 
our water systems are getting polluted
and<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.580> they<00:02:12.910> like<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.450> clean<00:02:14.320> water<00:02:14.740> you

that's what they kind of live in and
punky<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.400> Andy's<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.240> all<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.480> stuff<00:02:19.630> but

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
punky in Andy's and all that stuff but

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.460 
punky in Andy's and all that stuff but
but<00:02:21.970> yeah<00:02:22.120> we're<00:02:22.630> basically<00:02:22.930> killing<00:02:23.290> them

all runs into little Creek's and that's
where<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> lot<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.940> these<00:02:31.090> guys<00:02:31.300> lives<00:02:31.660> in

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
where a lot of these guys lives in

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:41.580 
where a lot of these guys lives in
creeks<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.850> yeah<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:41.080> clip<00:02:41.350> here

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
creeks like that so yeah this clip here

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.900 
creeks like that so yeah this clip here
is<00:02:41.740> actually<00:02:42.070> one<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:42.520> friends<00:02:44.700> he's<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910

is actually one of my friends he's a
he's<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> decent<00:02:46.450> sized<00:02:46.780> when<00:02:47.020> I've<00:02:47.170> got<00:02:47.590> some

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
he's a decent sized when I've got some

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.400 
he's a decent sized when I've got some
bigger<00:02:47.920> ones<00:02:48.010> around<00:02:48.370> here<00:02:48.990> he<00:02:49.990> was<00:02:50.110> down<00:02:50.260> in

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
bigger ones around here he was down in

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
bigger ones around here he was down in
the<00:02:50.470> bottom<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:50.980> pond<00:02:51.250> basically

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the bottom of this pond basically

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.030 
the bottom of this pond basically
sleeping<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.420> probably<00:02:52.780> woke<00:02:52.990> him<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.290> it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
sleeping I probably woke him up it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.500 
sleeping I probably woke him up it's
about<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> time<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.850> year<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.210> kind<00:02:55.480> of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
about that time of the year it's kind of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.020 
about that time of the year it's kind of
borderline<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:57.220> they<00:02:57.340> tend<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.850> come

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
borderline you know they tend to come

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.000 
borderline you know they tend to come
out<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:58.990> it<00:02:59.110> gets<00:02:59.200> too<00:02:59.440> cold<00:02:59.650> it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
out but you know if it gets too cold it

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.720 
out but you know if it gets too cold it
can<00:03:00.130> ultimately<00:03:00.340> kill<00:03:00.940> him<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:02.730> basically

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
can ultimately kill him so I basically

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.630 
can ultimately kill him so I basically
threw<00:03:04.120> him<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.450> another<00:03:04.660> pond<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.290> he<00:03:05.380> can

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
threw him in another pond and he can

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.310 
threw him in another pond and he can
live<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.850> until<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.720> one's<00:03:07.930> done<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.260> he

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
live in it until this one's done if he

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.630 
live in it until this one's done if he
wants<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> come<00:03:08.710> back<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.100> come<00:03:09.310> back<00:03:09.460> and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
wants to come back and come back and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
wants to come back and come back and
they<00:03:09.730> usually<00:03:09.850> do<00:03:10.090> they're<00:03:10.300> very<00:03:10.450> territorial

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660

these<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:27.100> little<00:03:27.340> frog<00:03:27.520> was<00:03:27.700> happy<00:03:28.000> that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
these this little frog was happy that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.060 
these this little frog was happy that
I'm<00:03:28.270> cleaning<00:03:28.600> out<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.810> pond<00:03:29.020> so<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.920> let

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
I'm cleaning out the pond so I just let

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:38.000 
I'm cleaning out the pond so I just let
them<00:03:30.100> sit<00:03:30.430> there

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.250 

and<00:03:38.640> ultimately<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.810> know<00:03:39.900> what's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260

important it's a lot of beneficial

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.399 
important it's a lot of beneficial
bacteria<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.390> stuff<00:03:51.569> like<00:03:51.689> that<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.900> I'll<00:03:52.230> do

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
bacteria and stuff like that and I'll do

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.319 
bacteria and stuff like that and I'll do
another<00:03:52.500> video<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.310> stuff<00:03:53.489> down<00:03:54.209> the
