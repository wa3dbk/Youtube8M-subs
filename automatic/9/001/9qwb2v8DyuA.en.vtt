00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to set up you'll stand very close to the

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.039 
to set up you'll stand very close to the
bar<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.490> just<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.970> same<00:00:06.240> thing<00:00:06.270> it's<00:00:06.720> just

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the feet are closer together

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.200 
the feet are closer together
still<00:00:09.269> just<00:00:09.870> maybe<00:00:10.050> 2<00:00:10.380> centimeters<00:00:10.889> away<00:00:11.210> now

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
still just maybe 2 centimeters away now

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.990 
still just maybe 2 centimeters away now
what's<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> next<00:00:13.380> step<00:00:13.710> now<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.280> go<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> grip

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
what's the next step now you go to grip

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.470 
what's the next step now you go to grip
the<00:00:15.120> bar

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the bar

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.980 
the bar
does<00:00:15.630> anyone<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.109> use<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> hook<00:00:16.710> grip<00:00:19.670> to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
does anyone here use the hook grip to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.460 
does anyone here use the hook grip to
you<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.350> use<00:00:22.529> yeah<00:00:22.830> okay<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> couple<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.170> I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you you use yeah okay so a couple the I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339 
you you use yeah okay so a couple the I
guess<00:00:25.830> that's<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.130> average<00:00:27.170> we'll<00:00:28.170> talk

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
guess that's about average we'll talk

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439 
guess that's about average we'll talk
about<00:00:28.500> hook<00:00:28.920> grip<00:00:29.130> maybe<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
about hook grip maybe one on one if you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
about hook grip maybe one on one if you
need<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> already<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.980> then

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
need it but if you already use it then

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.850 
need it but if you already use it then
that's<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> problem<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> then

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
that's probably not a problem so then

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.350 
that's probably not a problem so then
you<00:00:37.860> would<00:00:38.040> set<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.370> grip<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.180> ahead<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you would set your grip so go ahead and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
you would set your grip so go ahead and
and<00:00:39.750> grab<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> bar<00:00:44.210> all<00:00:45.210> right<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.800> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and grab the bar all right so you just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
and grab the bar all right so you just
hold<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.670> hold<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> position<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.260> if

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
hold them hold in that position so if

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.110 
hold them hold in that position so if
you<00:00:49.469> look<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.010> look<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> side<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you look if you look from the side you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
you look if you look from the side you
can<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.750> his<00:00:52.620> shoulder<00:00:53.070> blade<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
can see that his shoulder blade here is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
can see that his shoulder blade here is
directly<00:00:54.660> over<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> barbell<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> that's

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
directly over the barbell and that's

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
directly over the barbell and that's
where<00:00:56.340> that's<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.000> he<00:00:57.120> needs<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
where that's where he needs to be this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
where that's where he needs to be this
is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> position<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:59.370> he's<00:00:59.640> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.329> in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
is the position that he's going to be in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.779 
is the position that he's going to be in
once<00:01:01.079> any<00:01:01.320> appreciable<00:01:02.219> amount<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> weight

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
once any appreciable amount of weight

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
once any appreciable amount of weight
gets<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> bar<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> position<00:01:04.409> he'll

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
gets on the bar this is a position he'll

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
gets on the bar this is a position he'll
be<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.860> before<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.339> bar<00:01:05.519> leaves<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> floor<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
be in before the bar leaves the floor so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
be in before the bar leaves the floor so
you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.110> relax<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:10.130> you'll<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> set<00:01:11.580> your

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you can relax so you'll want to set your

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.920 
you can relax so you'll want to set your
grip<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:13.189> most<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> us<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
grip and then most of us have a little

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
grip and then most of us have a little
ritual<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.820> between

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
ritual that we go through between

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.530 
ritual that we go through between
breathing<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.890> getting<00:01:19.890> ourselves<00:01:20.009> ready<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
