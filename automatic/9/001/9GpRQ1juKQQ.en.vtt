00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
struggling with myself because I like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.370 
struggling with myself because I like
black<00:01:40.470> ops<00:01:40.770> 2<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> came<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
black ops 2 I really do but it came to a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.649 
black ops 2 I really do but it came to a
point<00:01:43.470> where<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.040> forced<00:01:44.640> myself<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.090> play<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659

point where I forced myself to play it
and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.409> thought<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.130> wouldn't<00:01:47.460> happen

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and I thought that this wouldn't happen

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
and I thought that this wouldn't happen
after<00:01:48.060> modern<00:01:48.299> warfare<00:01:48.450> 3<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.049> thought<00:01:49.590> no<00:01:49.799> way

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
after modern warfare 3 I thought no way
