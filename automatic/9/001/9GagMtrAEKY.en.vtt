00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 Welcome 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.080
 I ask you all for admission 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 how is this person 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.480
 and the one who loses 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.060
 at night 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.590
 a beautiful night 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.490
 I'll be there is a bit of all the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.490
 pubs 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 like all the songs 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 already 30 years 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.700
 beautiful 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.610
 memories 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 that bring us all these songs one 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 little boleros 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.520
 some mariachi 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.020
 all my musicians tonight 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 to all my people of sound and lights and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.060
 all of them that make it possible that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 we can be in different cities 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.360
 all these nights traveling all the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.220
 country thanks to each and every one of them 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.220
 a strong applause also 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 if you think we continue for something something 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.710
 who told me something that did not 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.860
 that is good for the soul and for the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.860
 heart 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 is this bolero that is the classic 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 a bolero I think 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.560
 for me it has been a privilege to reach it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 and in some way 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.720
 that other generations have had the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.660
 opportunity to listen to him because they are 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.450
 songs 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.600
 and that are going to be part of the story 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.610
 always always where there is a heart 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.640
 the hearts and a great history of 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.640
 love 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.569
 I have to get up and welcome many 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.569
