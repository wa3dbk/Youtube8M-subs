00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello and welcome to such a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.589
 very special touch idea 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 you can already see the mb trac 1600 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.110
 turbo from bmw it came out and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 rbm modding already has a lot 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.720
 very good reputation and this is the mod 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 once again perfectly just look at you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 the time at no single texture error 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 which I have found so far 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.510
 textures of the tires we see in it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 wear we really see that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 thing rocked down for a few years already 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
 has the textures the clubs that is 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.079
 everything really really cool 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.850
 made so there is hardly anything 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 comparable look at here 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.789
 the small hydraulic hoses etc 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 that is really great the suspension of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 Lettering that's easy with the best 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 what you can get at the moment 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.809
 mods so bmw you should definitely 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 notice the thing yes theory 256 ps 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 the six-cylinder engine from Mercedes, the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.520
 days bm modding has announced there are 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.339
 also another 1800 of them 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.380
 and then comes a hedge 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.479
 unfortunately a hack front loader a hack 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.020
 front loader of course a hack warehouse where 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.360
 you can grow a lada properly 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 beautiful looks like on the side of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 bm modding over and invite you 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.650
 Best of all what you can do yes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.930
 so much for advertising for bm 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 boarding we want the whole mine 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 watch the shop 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.299
 we have a bm trucker mb trac so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.770
 bm I am now fully in bmw mb trac 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.030
 1600 turbo v3 with 156 ps nominal power 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 I have a beautiful six-cylinder 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.780
 already told 40,000 costs the whole im 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 shop by that he really already 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 older jana I find that even in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 okay so i did not want that yet 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 because now I will be around the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
 Setting the helper box and you see animals 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 as a passenger we can enter 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.829
 so right here as a passenger 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.930
 you sit while driving to watch and 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.960
 Here you can already see the cockpit 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.390
 is just bomber so not too 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.759
 almost surpass the textures 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 if that's how it always would be then i would 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 be very very happy so yes we are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.629
 now changed in the driver's seat 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 you see the whole thing here again 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.470
 with a little quick all around 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.409
 view from the driver view the textures 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.030
 Of course, they are still divine 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.769
 opens the c control and we can 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.849
 see that again right now 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.519
 loving detail pays attention to the lever 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.230
 Hello I have to believe the ignition 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.940
 actuate 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.900
 that works with z if i put that right in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.840
 the long one already has that 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.700
 wonderful fence and then I push 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.099
 sometimes I believe these buttons here 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.810
 Back was setup so now you can see 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.889
 namely here the jack was pressed 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.420
 the door opens and that's it again 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.030
 of course, the same thing 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.519
 play on the other side like that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.639
 is that part of it? 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.819
 Now let's listen again 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:12.099
 we do not have a motor sound so you 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.769
 if the engine sound is not heard when 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.660
 something is up and so on that is 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.760
 A pity but I have to ask now 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.900
 not really either 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.609
 even the hand crank is moving here 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.680
 if you get the slices up and down 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.239
 or if you look at this 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.569
 coupÃ© the work is it is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.859
 Divine here the things window and door 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.000
 Of course it is on the other side as well 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.980
 available then we have, of course 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.660
 Work light in front and work light 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 right back here as toggle switch the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.540
 also animated is more or less that 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.739
 is beautiful 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.000
 so if you are good mods volt bm 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.129
 Actually mobbing always has an address like that 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.909
 good to have identified as a key 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.650
 Naturally 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:58.769
 but i want to turn it on now 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.389
 well what this mod again where I 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.010
 first show yourself the last idea 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.170
 Control is behind here 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.819
 because you can then the gate open and shut 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.730
 push here to the gate 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.769
 to push the rear window on us 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.379
 I find really nice made on so 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.510
 A nice animation is glass 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.859
 evenly to recognize the glass 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.389
 and so on, but the best story 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.009
 is yet to come i print k now 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.000
 described roof ahead 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:31.530
 and behold I have a built-in 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.229
 reversing facility is not cool 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:39.449
 So honestly that's terrific 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:43.080
 so we are again boss over that 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.940
 are mobile and of course 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.349
 and now I will be the normal one 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.280
 turn on the light you pay attention to the 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.660
 fittings 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.030
 you really see how great that 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.280
 so it is that is illuminated 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.509
 awesome and now we have the here 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.789
 Return direction as you can see now 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.810
 even sitting gets to the other side 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.759
 inclined there will be times now one 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.380
 small reminder round turn with 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.240
 Rourke was a facility without one 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.250
 So when driving back 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.289
 create a direction in the return 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.419
 13 km h, that's not how it is 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.580
 fast but you should consider that 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.960
 old tug and back then 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.259
 one direction was already 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.539
 yes there you were but if you something 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.610
 that's what I've got then 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.610
 turn it over now so we in 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 the other direction look in the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.680
 real direction for what I say yes 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.020
 that's the way it is 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.699
 standard direction at the tractor 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.050
 as well as getting used mostly 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.690
 as far as her tormenting direction so far only 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.960
 stuff the witch with a cultivated shredder 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.580
 and something or you with a butterfly 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.990
 more work and here in this view 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.810
 is he doing really well? 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.400
 get 50 km h what you like 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.219
 tug also really neat 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.710
 is and it is just right 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.169
 I have to say nice the driving behavior 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.980
 is just divine one then lies here 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.510
 really a bit on the street 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.190
 I'll be slalom here now, too 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.100
 Of course I was driving at the moment 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.230
 Steering wheel but you will feel it believe 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.810
 I'm really great 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.080
 keep on the road and drive 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.480
 just beautiful so ingenious 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.610
 watch from my point of view real 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.290
 Duty murder at the small machines 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.540
 if you start small again or 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.000
 so what a little something new would like 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.130
 just mb trac doom or fate 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.780
 something then in any case even the 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.220
 Recommendation the days pass 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.740
 he would I then the front-end loader 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.420
 Imagine the shredder sorry and 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.530
 of course the 1800 mb trac and 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.110
 friends see you next time 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.110
 with a hopefully equally cool mod
