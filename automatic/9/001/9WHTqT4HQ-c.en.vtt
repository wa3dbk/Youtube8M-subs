00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
price so they cost less it's less money

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.730 
price so they cost less it's less money
for<00:02:05.159> these<00:02:05.310> books<00:02:05.610> now<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.659> tactic<00:02:07.229> or

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
i could write better books better books

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.899 
i could write better books better books
that's<00:02:13.439> a<00:02:13.680> tactic<00:02:14.360> that's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.799> business<00:02:16.799> tactic

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:29.649 

so<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> deviation<00:02:24.470> deviation<00:02:28.280> deviation

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
so what is deviation deviation deviation

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.470 
so what is deviation deviation deviation
means<00:02:30.799> like<00:02:31.799> I'm<00:02:32.010> trying<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.640> way<00:02:32.849> but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
means like I'm trying to go this way but

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449 
means like I'm trying to go this way but
I<00:02:33.510> end<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.290> way<00:02:34.530> or<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> end<00:02:35.340> up

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
I end up going that way or I end up

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.390 
I end up going that way or I end up
going<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.909> way<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:37.500> something<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.159> wrong

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
going that way it's something is wrong

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.110 
going that way it's something is wrong
that's<00:02:39.120> deviation<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.379> let's<00:02:40.620> say<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.159> put<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that's deviation so let's say I put the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.020 
that's deviation so let's say I put the
price<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.720> books<00:02:43.099> from<00:02:44.099> twenty<00:02:44.640> dollars

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

to ten dollars from twenty dollars to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.770 
to ten dollars from twenty dollars to
ten<00:02:49.260> dollars<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.519> am<00:02:51.060> selling<00:02:51.510> books
