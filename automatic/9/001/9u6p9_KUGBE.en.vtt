but does inside indoors like my indoor
track<00:03:20.389> and<00:03:20.739> they're<00:03:21.739> really<00:03:21.979> comfortable

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
track and they're really comfortable

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.039 
track and they're really comfortable
there's<00:03:22.879> a<00:03:22.970> good<00:03:23.209> arch<00:03:23.389> support<00:03:23.449> and<00:03:26.049> that

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
there's a good arch support and that

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.710 
there's a good arch support and that
like<00:03:27.229> I<00:03:27.349> had<00:03:27.500> no<00:03:27.709> pain<00:03:28.009> with<00:03:28.489> them<00:03:28.699> and<00:03:29.569> they

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
like I had no pain with them and they

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.589 
like I had no pain with them and they
fit<00:03:30.040> reasonably<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.400> don't<00:03:32.060> say<00:03:32.180> they<00:03:32.269> fit<00:03:32.449> too

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
fit reasonably I don't say they fit too

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.530 
fit reasonably I don't say they fit too
wide<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.379> if<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:34.040> have<00:03:34.129> a<00:03:34.189> mid<00:03:34.699> to<00:03:35.030> wide<00:03:35.209> foot

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
wide but if you have a mid to wide foot

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.729 
wide but if you have a mid to wide foot
they<00:03:35.840> probably<00:03:36.139> they'll<00:03:36.560> probably<00:03:37.299> fit<00:03:38.299> you

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
they probably they'll probably fit you

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.890 
they probably they'll probably fit you
so<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> narrow<00:03:41.449> foot<00:03:41.629> you<00:03:41.750> can

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so and if you have a narrow foot you can

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.429 
so and if you have a narrow foot you can
just<00:03:42.049> tighten<00:03:42.229> it<00:03:42.409> obviously<00:03:42.889> but<00:03:44.229> so<00:03:45.229> yeah

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
just tighten it obviously but so yeah

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.080 
just tighten it obviously but so yeah
they<00:03:45.709> fit<00:03:45.949> they<00:03:46.099> probably<00:03:46.340> find<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.699> majority

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
they fit they probably find the majority

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.550 
they fit they probably find the majority
of<00:03:47.120> people<00:03:47.479> and<00:03:48.400> really<00:03:49.400> comfortable<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.209> you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
of people and really comfortable and you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.659 
of people and really comfortable and you
really<00:03:51.560> notice<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.949> cushioning<00:03:52.310> when<00:03:52.549> you're

really notice the cushioning when you're

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.240 
really notice the cushioning when you're
running<00:03:52.849> because<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.590> cushioning<00:03:55.040> is<00:03:55.129> not

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
running because on the cushioning is not

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.179 
running because on the cushioning is not
it's<00:03:55.909> not<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.389> dent<00:03:56.719> it's<00:03:56.930> not<00:03:57.079> super<00:03:57.919> dense
