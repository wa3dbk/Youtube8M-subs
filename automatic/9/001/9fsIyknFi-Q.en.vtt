tall and you get a lot of core work in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.380 
tall and you get a lot of core work in
here<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> lot<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> different

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
here so we do a lot of different

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.649 
here so we do a lot of different
positions<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
positions and right down here if the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.649 
positions and right down here if the
frame<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.110> bike<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.369> tension<00:01:21.000> control

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
frame of your bike is a tension control

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.170 
frame of your bike is a tension control
and<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.030> were

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and so that would be as if we were

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
and so that would be as if we were
pretending<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> hill<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.680> visualize

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pretending to go up a hill you visualize

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
pretending to go up a hill you visualize
going<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> hill<00:01:26.700> increase<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.960> your

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
going up a hill increase in your your

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
going up a hill increase in your your
attention<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.810> decrease<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
attention and then you decrease it and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
attention and then you decrease it and
this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.369> when<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.850> sprint<00:01:33.329> indoor
