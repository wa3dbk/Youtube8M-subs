00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.779
 I start this makeup with a make-up 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.310
 the brown water that I'm going to apply on 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.689
 all of his face with a brush 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.130
 in the foundation made jappix has 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.419
 actually as I will apply a background 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.369
 liquid complexion that is to say that 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.140
 I'm trying to melt the color in 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.270
 his skin so that really if there is 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.719
 no demarcation and that's it 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.710
 really the effect of a second skin 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.180
 then with a blush at dawn the stake 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.129
 come illuminate the areas that they think 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.629
 need it so in France actually 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.429
 I'm going to make an illusion that his 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.379
 men are more prominent than they 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.579
 are in reality so typically the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.920
 cheekbones to give a face a little 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.600
 more angular and the front you see I 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.609
 do this form 2 and to give already 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.899
 this werewolf shape for the nose 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.460
 it is the same usually just known 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.600
 the bridge of the nose to give an air of 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.920
 more trumpet but not tired at all 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.210
 what we want I do a little bit 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.649
 sides actually to give the impression 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 that the nose is wider than he 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.109
 is actually since in fact I'm going 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.610
 try to recreate a museum afterwards with 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.080
 an iron to the black I want to come draw 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.040
 this amount of women on the cheeks in 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.360
 do this to what I'm going to do 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.470
 if I gave myself the side of the face a 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.510
 a little bit more so we're going to have 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.670
 the impression that part of two years 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.050
 and come over to us and it will give 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.120
 the illusion of having a muzzle what all 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.980
 so just for that I do it 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.690
 simply with this lighthouse with black water 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.400
 that I apply first by all like that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.560
 and then I come to melt him in the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.970
 blow and so to spot the place where 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.710
 I put it in fact I put it just in 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.790
 below the cheekbones a little bit 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.110
 above where I would have done the con 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.460
 touring and I used a little bit of 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.170
 the edge of his hair so at the level of 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.970
 these times to choose where I 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.980
 do this then I take back the lighthouse 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.270
 brown I took just now and with 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.740
 a brush to linars I want to come do 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 little streaks there as I am in 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.270
 doing to give the illusion 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 we have fur that starts from 7.2 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.500
 would come to me in fact cheeks and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
 then I take a lighthouse at dawn 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.710
 white because I had just now 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.300
 and I will go over for 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 give some kind of depth because 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 if I just leave the brown like that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.120
 it's a little flat so when I 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.860
 will take a shot in Morocco where one 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480
 blow the white to try to give 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.650
 really had a little texture 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
 is actually doing this like these 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.440
 departures to the water they go a little bit 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 mix with the black that had in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.679
 underneath and it's really going to be done 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.450
 together it will make an effect rather not 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.980
 badly and rather real and I find 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.420
 if ever there is need game make a little 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.890
 little hair root for pau 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 really we do not see the beginning of my 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.010
 traits and I add a little bit about 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.209
 the cheeks not only on the edges 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.300
 the story given a little more realism 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.879
 Russian for the eyebrows to langeac me 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.560
 made the task easy a little message 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.860
 personal darling if you look at this 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.019
 video 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.069
 so I take back the black makeup that 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.630
 I had earlier and I want to come 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.120
 widen a little his eyebrows that are 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.830
 already wide enough so to take them in 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.569
 made until the time as you can 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.500
 actually see I'm the v form that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.299
 I had done earlier on his 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.000
 front simply to join 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.319
 hair on in the hair and to make 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.580
 its ba in actually using exactly the 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.750
 same technique to make the mistake on 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.010
 the cheeks that is to say that I you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.329
 did not see me complete the eyebrow 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.190
 d'armand the draw I actually paid 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.480
 streaks with black makeup then 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.650
 with the raw format then with the white 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.970
 and so on until the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.819
 I like and that everything is 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.530
 melted together then I also add 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.970
 at the hairline is the same 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 I'm trying to keep following this 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.360
 shape had to put some hair a little 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.690
 longer and in the direction of the forehead 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.519
 at the middle level of his forehead then 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.230
 with black makeup I decide to darken a 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.310
 little bit the sides of his nose so 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.590
 to do some sort of a trick tale he's 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.880
 even further than I would have done if 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.950
 I wanted to make a check on the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.750
 normal lean to give that effect again 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.829
 muzzle for the muzzle I'm doing 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.510
 be careful not to make a shape 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.670
 right on his nose but rather fit 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.700
 of v so the tip of his nose will stay 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.690
 without black makes it interesting to do that 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.650
 it's going to make an illusion 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.060
 optical in fact we will have 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.530
 the impression that the nose is wider 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.750
 than what he really is 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 so that will help again in this spirit 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.930
 to have a museum for that I wanted 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.220
 not leave them like that because I 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.510
 it was a little flat so I decided 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.889
 to put a little bit of black but I 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.709
 did not want to make a makeup 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.359
 lips and then to finish I 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.109
 put a little rouge on the level of 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.910
 the root of these of lower Cecilia 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.680
 so for his eyes to give a little 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.880
 the impression of having bloodied who is going 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.530
 go very well with the lenses that we 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.160
 chose which are yellow with 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.650
 circumvention 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.430
 so he then applies and then haves 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.930
 all the products I have that we have 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.760
 used so the lenses also everything 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.079
 the makeup will be listed in bar 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.280
 of information in please is really 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.709
 the description of the video you will have 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.130
 all references and also links 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.480
 when when I have it green 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.820
 where you can buy them 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.780
 target them buy for the teeth one has 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.220
 opted for vampire teeth 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.330
 finally because in fact it was 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.820
 the most comfortable and cd in 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.650
 really small and all that was in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.970
 blue garros was rather uncomfortable 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.580
 and not at all realistic so we decided 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.290
 to do that and to finish I decided to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.020
 put a brown on his face for 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.010
 give this effect not uniform I 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.720
 regret having done it this way 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.050
 I should have used a sponge 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.220
 beard 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.420
 if you have a sacred thing that my 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.490
 close to barr will be better than what 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.950
 I did it and that's it for the look 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.330
 so you are holy preuil you can 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.950
 have fun that the one like him is 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.630
 trade with and so we also did the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.600
 claws the werewolf is very proud of 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.430
 that of his manicure and we also did this 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.740
 makeup that goes with all that 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.840
 will have it tomorrow and by tomorrow I'll get you 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.430
 leave with yesterday's tutorial and I'll 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.210
 tell tomorrow so for an upcoming tutorial 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.210
 Damine Ciao
