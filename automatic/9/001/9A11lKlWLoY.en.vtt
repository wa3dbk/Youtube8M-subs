really happen right there but I was
getting<00:02:14.040> kills<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.519> take<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> look<00:02:14.909> at<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
getting kills if you take a look at the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.789 
getting kills if you take a look at the
kill<00:02:15.269> fee<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.569> kind<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.810> stuff<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.590> yeah

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
kill fee and that kind of stuff but yeah

kill fee and that kind of stuff but yeah
and<00:02:17.129> Morrow<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.760> three<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.750> gun<00:02:19.200> skill<00:02:19.500> was

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and Morrow for three the gun skill was

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.410 
and Morrow for three the gun skill was
the<00:02:20.189> thing<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.549> really<00:02:20.760> required<00:02:21.239> but

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the thing that was really required but

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.569 
the thing that was really required but
in<00:02:21.540> black<00:02:21.720> ops<00:02:21.930> 2<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.560> killstreaks<00:02:23.129> are<00:02:23.310> all

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
in black ops 2 the killstreaks are all

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.550 
in black ops 2 the killstreaks are all
the<00:02:23.730> matters<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.299> that's<00:02:24.659> one<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.530> things

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the matters and that's one of the things

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.140 
the matters and that's one of the things
I<00:02:25.799> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.010> talk<00:02:26.159> about<00:02:26.189> that's<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.849> major

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
I want to talk about that's the major

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.550 
I want to talk about that's the major
thing<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.720> had<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> realize<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.530> this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
thing that I had to realize in this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.140 
thing that I had to realize in this
gameplay<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.069> started<00:02:29.549> thinking<00:02:29.879> about<00:02:29.970> my

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
gameplay I started thinking about my

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270 
gameplay I started thinking about my
transition<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.930> black<00:02:31.140> ops<00:02:31.349> 1<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.709> 10<00:02:31.890> for<00:02:32.069> 3

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
transition from black ops 1 and 10 for 3

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850 
transition from black ops 1 and 10 for 3
and<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:33.239> remembered<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.200> black<00:02:34.349> ops<00:02:34.530> 1<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and I remembered that in black ops 1 the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.410 
and I remembered that in black ops 1 the
killstreaks<00:02:35.280> they<00:02:35.459> were<00:02:35.549> all<00:02:35.700> powerful<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
killstreaks they were all powerful and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.660 
killstreaks they were all powerful and
it's<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> same<00:02:37.500> exact<00:02:37.799> thing<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.430> game

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it's the same exact thing in this game

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's the same exact thing in this game
and<00:02:38.879> that's<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.269> reasons<00:02:39.599> why<00:02:39.690> i<00:02:39.720> like

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and that's one of the reasons why i like

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
was running in this gameplay i'm pretty

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.860 
was running in this gameplay i'm pretty
sure<00:03:25.590> i<00:03:25.650> was<00:03:25.859> using<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.220> MSMC<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
sure i was using the MSMC and this is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.659 
sure i was using the MSMC and this is
the<00:03:27.989> best<00:03:28.169> submachine<00:03:28.650> gun<00:03:28.829> period<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.489> least

helped out to your next skill streak a

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.349 
helped out to your next skill streak a
little<00:04:04.590> bit<00:04:04.709> then<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.250> had<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.760> lodestar

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
little bit then I had on the lodestar

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.300 
little bit then I had on the lodestar
and<00:04:06.599> those<00:04:07.199> things<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.739> almost<00:04:07.949> want<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.250> say

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
and those things I almost want to say

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.369 
and those things I almost want to say
it's<00:04:08.699> better<00:04:09.000> than<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.329> swarm<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.169> some

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
it's better than a swarm in some

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.050 
it's better than a swarm in some
situations<00:04:10.919> you<00:04:11.159> can<00:04:11.190> do<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> lot<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.699> work<00:04:11.940> with

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
situations you can do a lot of work with

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.430 
situations you can do a lot of work with
those<00:04:12.239> things<00:04:12.479> and<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.229> would<00:04:13.349> definitely

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
those things and I would definitely

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.199 
those things and I would definitely
recommend<00:04:13.680> running<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.609> well<00:04:14.909> as<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
recommend running that as well as the

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.939 
recommend running that as well as the
veto<00:04:15.389> warship<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.900> only<00:04:16.169> thing<00:04:16.409> with<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.709> is

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
veto warship the only thing with this is

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.460 
veto warship the only thing with this is
it<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.340> get<00:04:17.430> shot<00:04:17.760> down<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.599> easily<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.320> it

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
it can get shot down so easily but it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.259 
it can get shot down so easily but it
does<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.889> much<00:04:20.070> work<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.609> i<00:04:20.639> said<00:04:20.909> i<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
does so much work like i said i like to

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.730 
does so much work like i said i like to
call<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.539> akimbo<00:04:21.840> chopper<00:04:22.320> gunner<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
call it the akimbo chopper gunner it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.649 
call it the akimbo chopper gunner it
does<00:04:23.159> a<00:04:23.190> ton<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.460> work<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.940> it's<00:04:24.120> almost<00:04:24.479> like

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
does a ton of work and it's almost like

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.180 
does a ton of work and it's almost like
the<00:04:24.780> gunship<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.469> a<00:04:25.500> chopper

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
the gunship but a chopper

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.250 
the gunship but a chopper
mix<00:04:26.490> because<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.300> can't<00:04:27.570> shoot<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.900> missiles

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
mix because it can't shoot the missiles

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.690 
mix because it can't shoot the missiles
