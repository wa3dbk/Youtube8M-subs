00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello everyone, and so a short video about 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.470
 lada granta consumption 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.290
 mean this car a little more than nine 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.070
 months means running you can see 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.529
 about 13,000 kilometers outside now 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.789
 us 18 degrees of heat means that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.789
 concerns run 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 15 liters per 100 kilometers average 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.040
 mileage cars are used 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.290
 somewhere 60 by 40 city all city on 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.190
 city ​​so let's say this tag is mileage 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.500
 current but AvtoVAZ hid him when he 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 dads nandu gets less than 20 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.879
 liters then she shows up here on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.629
 there is a view of current consumption in general when 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.180
 driving average consumption average consumption 15 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.920
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.170
 as for me it is a lot of us, but 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 show four kilometers to 105 to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.550
 refills given that helped us 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.550
 almost voltage 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.650
 so that's about 15 liters in general, that's it 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.619
 This car is in my opinion it is very much 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.909
 that is, we somehow don't know 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.190
 be it there to 30 thousand if she is not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.420
 izdakhnet actually car because she 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.259
 won't eat 14 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.030
 but so in general it lives 15 with me 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.009
 just many subscribers asked to remove 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 about consumption therefore understanding separately 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.799
 there is also a full review on the channel 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.470
 and lada granta with automatic means until 2013 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.030
 year of release and several reports on 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.550
 breakdowns subscribe constantly mean 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.429
 look after this car so let's say on and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.869
 everything that happens to her in salary but 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.630
 views in principle on the channel very much 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:00.119
 interesting thing is that if you subscribe 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.119
 it will be very good for everyone bye
