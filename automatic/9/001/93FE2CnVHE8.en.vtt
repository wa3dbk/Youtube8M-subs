and<00:02:32.630> these<00:02:33.630> shelves<00:02:33.959> were<00:02:34.260> designed<00:02:35.420> designed

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and these shelves were designed designed

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
and these shelves were designed designed
just<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:36.780> tubes<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.890> there's<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> huge

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
just for tubes and so there's a huge

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.000 
just for tubes and so there's a huge
amount<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.180> tubes<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:44.959> I'm<00:02:45.959> sure<00:02:46.350> more<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
amount of tubes here I'm sure more that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
amount of tubes here I'm sure more that
I'll<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.760> able<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.090> use<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.690> lifetime

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
I'll have be able to use in a lifetime

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.740 
I'll have be able to use in a lifetime
but<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:51.950> try<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.010> use<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:54.060> think<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.630> I'd

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
but then try and use I think what I'd

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.890 
but then try and use I think what I'd
like<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.049> try<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.320> do<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:56.430> some<00:02:56.910> make

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
like to try to do is to make some make

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.220 
like to try to do is to make some make
some<00:02:57.930> radios<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> things<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.459> use<00:03:00.110> some<00:03:01.110> of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
some radios and things that use some of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650 
some radios and things that use some of
these<00:03:01.380> tubes<00:03:01.769> because<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.519> really<00:03:03.239> don't<00:03:03.480> plan

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
these tubes because I really don't plan

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.080 
these tubes because I really don't plan
on<00:03:04.049> getting<00:03:04.230> many<00:03:04.590> more<00:03:04.709> TVs<00:03:05.459> there's<00:03:05.820> just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
on getting many more TVs there's just

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.539 
on getting many more TVs there's just
not<00:03:06.709> most<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.860> them<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.130> gone<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
not most of them have gone to the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.940 
not most of them have gone to the
landfill<00:03:09.000> already<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.720> probably<00:03:10.290> won't<00:03:10.709> get

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
landfill already I probably won't get

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.540 
landfill already I probably won't get
any<00:03:11.190> more<00:03:11.540> tube<00:03:12.540> type<00:03:12.870> TVs<00:03:13.440> many

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
any more tube type TVs many

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.330 
any more tube type TVs many
I<00:03:14.580> mean<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> might<00:03:15.270> come<00:03:15.480> across<00:03:15.630> one<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:17.100> most

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
I mean I might come across one but most

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.760 
I mean I might come across one but most
of<00:03:17.490> these<00:03:17.670> tubes<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.480> those<00:03:18.720> designed<00:03:19.590> for

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
of these tubes are those designed for

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.210 
of these tubes are those designed for
use<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.040> serious<00:03:20.760> string<00:03:21.000> TVs<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> they<00:03:22.980> can

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
use in serious string TVs so they can

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.990 
use in serious string TVs so they can
work<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:24.410> repair<00:03:25.410> those<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
work to repair those that I have but I I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.180 
work to repair those that I have but I I
know<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.570> some<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.140> them<00:03:28.260> I'd<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.830> use

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
know that some of them I'd like to use

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.990 
know that some of them I'd like to use
in<00:03:29.640> making<00:03:29.970> new<00:03:30.420> designs<00:03:30.990> of<00:03:31.670> radios<00:03:32.670> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
in making new designs of radios and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.740 
in making new designs of radios and
things<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:34.370> there's<00:03:35.370> there's<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.630> are

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
things and there's there's some that are

things and there's there's some that are
used<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:37.200> more<00:03:37.440> things<00:03:37.800> like<00:03:38.270> like<00:03:39.270> 6<00:03:39.540> X<00:03:39.780> 4<00:03:40.220> 12<00:03:41.220> B

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
used in more things like like 6 X 4 12 B

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.950 
used in more things like like 6 X 4 12 B
a6<00:03:42.060> used<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.720> radios<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:44.300> bought<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> bunch<00:03:45.690> of

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
a6 used in radios I bought a bunch of

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.250 
a6 used in radios I bought a bunch of
these<00:03:46.110> Stanton<00:03:46.650> phono<00:03:46.920> cartridges<00:03:48.260> because

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
these Stanton phono cartridges because

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.700 
these Stanton phono cartridges because
I'm<00:03:49.830> going<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.130> use<00:03:50.340> them<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.790> restore<00:03:51.710> record

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
I'm going to use them to restore record

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.400 
I'm going to use them to restore record
players<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.400> these<00:03:54.030> are<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.390> found<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.110> best

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
players and these are I found the best

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.940 
players and these are I found the best
for<00:03:56.070> jukeboxes<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.840> kind<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.380> record

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
for jukeboxes and the kind of record

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.880 
for jukeboxes and the kind of record
changers<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.790> use<00:04:00.120> they're<00:04:00.510> magnetic<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
changers I use they're magnetic and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.830 
changers I use they're magnetic and
they're<00:04:02.010> super<00:04:02.520> durable<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.240> have<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> high

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
they're super durable and have a high

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.660 
they're super durable and have a high
output<00:04:06.470> but<00:04:07.470> here's<00:04:07.740> some<00:04:08.010> more<00:04:08.250> these<00:04:08.610> are

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
output but here's some more these are

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:18.550 
output but here's some more these are
pretty<00:04:09.390> much<00:04:09.680> all<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.940> smaller<00:04:12.620> tubes<00:04:13.620> here

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090 

and<00:04:19.609> then<00:04:20.609> we'll<00:04:20.820> get<00:04:20.970> down<00:04:21.780> here<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.710> some<00:04:22.950> of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and then we'll get down here to some of

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.670 
and then we'll get down here to some of
the<00:04:23.190> larger<00:04:23.760> ones<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:29.250> there's<00:04:29.640> some<00:04:29.790> 31<00:04:30.330> J<00:04:30.690> s6

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the larger ones and there's some 31 J s6

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.480 
the larger ones and there's some 31 J s6
I<00:04:32.130> might<00:04:32.850> have<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.600> end<00:04:33.720> up<00:04:34.020> modifying<00:04:34.830> some

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
I might have to end up modifying some

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.960 
I might have to end up modifying some
color<00:04:35.850> TVs<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:37.710> use<00:04:37.980> these<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:38.520> if<00:04:38.640> we<00:04:38.760> use<00:04:38.940> a

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
color TVs to use these like if we use a

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.810 
color TVs to use these like if we use a
6<00:04:39.390> j<00:04:39.630> s6<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.290> haven't<00:04:40.620> had<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> bad<00:04:41.100> one<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.460> don't

have wonder placed I could just set it

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.070 
have wonder placed I could just set it
up<00:04:44.490> with<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.700> different<00:04:45.120> filament<00:04:45.600> transformer

but I just wanted to kind of give a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.850 
but I just wanted to kind of give a
demonstration<00:05:19.949> of<00:05:20.819> my<00:05:21.439> collection<00:05:22.439> of<00:05:22.529> tubes

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
demonstration of my collection of tubes

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.330 
demonstration of my collection of tubes
and<00:05:23.219> how<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.370> got<00:05:23.759> them<00:05:23.939> organized<00:05:27.379> and<00:05:28.379> let's

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
and how I got them organized and let's

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.619 
and how I got them organized and let's
see<00:05:29.789> here<00:05:31.310> down<00:05:32.310> here<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.699> got<00:05:33.029> a<00:05:33.060> whole<00:05:33.389> bunch

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
see here down here I got a whole bunch

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.279 
see here down here I got a whole bunch
of<00:05:33.810> sixty<00:05:34.379> q5<00:05:34.979> tubes<00:05:35.569> and<00:05:36.569> I've<00:05:36.750> heard<00:05:37.110> that

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
of sixty q5 tubes and I've heard that

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.219 
of sixty q5 tubes and I've heard that
these<00:05:37.500> are<00:05:37.740> just<00:05:38.009> like<00:05:38.279> six<00:05:38.669> ge6<00:05:39.539> tubes<00:05:39.870> only

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
these are just like six ge6 tubes only

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.339 
these are just like six ge6 tubes only
they<00:05:40.379> got<00:05:40.560> an<00:05:40.740> octal<00:05:41.340> base<00:05:41.580> rather<00:05:42.569> than<00:05:42.779> a

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
they got an octal base rather than a

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.480 
they got an octal base rather than a
9-pin<00:05:44.279> base<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.529> if<00:05:46.529> I<00:05:46.800> needed<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.400> could

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
9-pin base so if I needed to I could

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.219 
9-pin base so if I needed to I could
modify<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.240> socket<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:50.310> on<00:05:50.460> RCA<00:05:50.909> TVs<00:05:51.569> to<00:05:51.960> use

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
modify the socket like on RCA TVs to use

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.820 
modify the socket like on RCA TVs to use
these<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:53.009> do<00:05:53.639> have<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> round<00:05:54.509> color<00:05:54.960> set<00:05:55.469> which

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
these I do have a round color set which

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.320 
these I do have a round color set which
i<00:05:56.069> think<00:05:56.129> is<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.490> CT<00:05:56.969> c<00:05:57.210> 9<00:05:57.419> or<00:05:57.659> CTC<00:05:58.169> 10<00:05:58.529> and<00:05:59.330> I

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
i think is a CT c 9 or CTC 10 and I

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.600 
i think is a CT c 9 or CTC 10 and I
don't<00:06:00.599> know<00:06:00.810> if<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.050> uses<00:06:01.319> 60<00:06:01.710> ki<00:06:01.919> 5<00:06:02.159> or<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.520> it

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
don't know if it uses 60 ki 5 or if it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.369 
don't know if it uses 60 ki 5 or if it
uses<00:06:02.969> 6<00:06:03.319> CB<00:06:04.319> 5<00:06:04.680> or<00:06:05.009> something<00:06:05.430> like<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.639> I

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
uses 6 CB 5 or something like that I

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.529 
uses 6 CB 5 or something like that I
just<00:06:07.379> have<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.740> see<00:06:08.009> it's<00:06:08.250> that's<00:06:09.180> another

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
just have to see it's that's another

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.629 
just have to see it's that's another

Edison cylinders in case I ever get an

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.209 
Edison cylinders in case I ever get an
Edison<00:06:17.159> phone<00:06:17.639> oh<00:06:17.879> I<00:06:18.500> came<00:06:19.500> across<00:06:19.740> these<00:06:20.039> at

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
Edison phone oh I came across these at

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.529 
Edison phone oh I came across these at
an<00:06:20.310> antique<00:06:20.639> store<00:06:20.879> one<00:06:21.240> time<00:06:23.300> but<00:06:24.300> there's

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
an antique store one time but there's
