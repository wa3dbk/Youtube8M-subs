00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
 good all attached to a new video as 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.479
 you know little by little we know 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.799
 more and more details of what's dogs and this 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:13.410
 It's time for a little time to discover a 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.599
 little how long will the game last us or 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.940
 how long it will be basically we have 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.200
 and the first details of all this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 well you know that yesterday started 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.820
 come out quite a lot of analysis and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.860
 other good analysis as I would say advances 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.290
 and others on many pages and everything 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.720
 that has come out is one of the things 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.000
 interesting are also are you there 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.789
 you know we made the news of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 children games these that basically 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.329
 they will be called digital trips and it will be a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.670
 kind of audio drug in which 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 basically then we will solve 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.109
 a way and good we will have there 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.909
 minigames as they are that we are a spider 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.329
 tank of more then also another in the 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.609
 that we are running over zombies or people 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.409
 diabolical we could say and talking more 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.019
 that do not know good missions 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.390
 we will have 39 and 39 missions 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.180
 separated into several acts then apart 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.160
 of that 93 secondary missions 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 it sounds a little deal 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.050
 criminals and others then apart from that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.690
 for other 53 secondary missions that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.870
 will be investigating how to investigate 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.120
 human trafficking people disappeared and 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.890
 others then apart from those 6 mini-games 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.210
 who have drinking chess poker 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 and so on and so on 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.680
 basically I do not know what else they had 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 I think there are only confirmed those 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.420
 three of those six then apart from that what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.790
 that said the digital trips that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 we will have four will be processes like 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 one of the best things in the game 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.420
 we could say no where we are a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.560
 kind of spider tank another in which 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.170
 we have to spoil 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.540
 zombies and other evil zombies 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.360
 some say zombies others say well 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.130
 people possessed and strange but good at 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.430
 definitively by pretty strange people 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 then also something similar like that 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.970
 as augmented reality in which 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 we have to kill alien ships and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.380
 other, although that's what he told us a lot about 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.910
 I have no fucking idea of how to how 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 will be but basically the duration then 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.140
 it seems quite long with this data 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.650
 apart from that we will have neither more nor less 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.340
 that 192 separate collectibles in 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.260
 four categories which then goes to 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.590
 increase what I believe the duration 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.030
 quite the game I think for 100% 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.820
 of the game according to state reading and others 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.350
 it's not going to be necessary to do it all 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.790
 I think the main missions do 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.440
 but what are all the secondary ones and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 I also think that with which to get 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.120
 100% will be quite feasible too 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.739
 for people who are looking for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.150
 trophies in fact I have here the data of 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.250
 how much of what is needed then 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 there are some that some things that you 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 you can actually stop collectables 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 You have to catch it, I think everyone 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.370
 but well I think that many things you 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.230
 You can also leave me aside for the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.049
 100% what is needed in the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.670
 description and nothing left you I leave saints 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.409
 things so good nothing more kids 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.299
 so the game will be long as 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.680
 you will remember in a tweet then one of the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.909
 developers said to complete 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.769
 one hundred percent will be about 100 hours 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.000
 but you already know that it is always 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.500
 exaggerate I think with this 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 with these data we are going to get a 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 little more not watching videos and of mate like 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.590
 are the secondary and the main 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.629
 well I guess it was a bit more but yes 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.269
 that is true that it can be quite 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.459
 long thorium I calculate that for 100% 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.049
 50-60 hours watching these numbers 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.659
 not because with 75 TAMEN was said to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.480
 It appears hundred percent, not 100 hours 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.849
 is it does not get to be so much sometimes with a 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.709
 guide logically with an area logically 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.599
 everything goes down without a guide so 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.000
 surely it is hours option but sure 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.769
 but good with a guide all going down and 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.510
 always them on the internet lately 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.430
 of videos and so on, so 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.970
 It will be as much if we want to do it without a guide 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.960
 then without more so nothing more 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.960
 because all
