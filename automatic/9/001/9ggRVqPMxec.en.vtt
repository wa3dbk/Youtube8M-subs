00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:08.650
 The galley beauty teach put here 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.280
 angle pentium calculator of yours 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.400
 come on 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.869
 here i am the calculator open then 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:24.740
 first thing to do is to create a 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:27.650
 tabelinha here the right angle point 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.010
 Okay, just for a color, you need to understand. 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.010
 best 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.190
 ottawa created beauty 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.379
 here we will do 1 x 1 in this 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.370
 cell will be where you are going to type your 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:55.510
 x same thing as y in the bottom 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:58.120
 result we will write what result 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 he wrote down the criterion of 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 You 're good, you 're ready, just raise it. 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.040
 a little 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 beauty in the result here we go 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 click here in cell b 13 and will come 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.259
 here in the forums bar 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.549
 let's make the following code code 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 equal 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:35.970
 relatives of 11 who is where he is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:46.110
 the x is there where xa is equal to z 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:49.710
 prass and the 16 x 1 424 14.9 is 423 eu 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 I'll make this subject the sound 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.179
 be uncertain and I will leave Japan very 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 these codes 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.970
 both process for now four in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.899
 description and for you beauty to continue 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:12.720
 here is equal to efe open parentheses b11 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:21.049
 which is where x is equal to 424 points and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 comma ninety- point semicolon 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:32.850
 relatives again to relatives again 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.110
 opening twice abief relatives of 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:47.010
 new 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:52.010
 bbb 11-591 which is the xi in case 424 or 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.470
 y I said wrong at the beginning then 424 and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:01.799
 591 x process 16 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:05.150
 if the 14 is 423 590 certain continuing the 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:09.310
 code close relatives 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:16.970
 / BF 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:20.599
 relatives 424 again - now cell 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.420
 hey, hey b12 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.420
 let's close it up here with five relatives 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.739
 12345 right here to have it working 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:43.930
 cool 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:50.060
 aac format O that you have round the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:55.599
 angu round 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:04:03.379
 now let's test here for example 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:14.030
 x200 yy 200 I know this angle of 62 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:17.209
 that's it, we can come here or 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.620
 angle of the calculator here and pull 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:26.560
 result there what is in b 13 put 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.560
 here or even 13 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.819
 pulled the result here 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.710
 You do not have to be typing all the time. 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:41.199
 300 380 66 points not already pulled that 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 That 's it, beauty , I'll leave the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.050
 codes already for you 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.080
 in the video description and to farm 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.009
 you there if not in these cells 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.539
 here o 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.810
 if you want to put in any other 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.810
 place just type cello here รณ 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.490
 for example here where here is a CEN 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.419
 xis here oh bronze you're going to change 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.150
 put the cell referring to your no 300 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.520
 ally and you will come here where the 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:20.680
 b12 O here and change that here too the 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:25.150
 Bronze 11 x b12 is the hold that y 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.000
 order here the hot angle xy result 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.280
 There's no mistake if you put the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.940
 result up will give error there has 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.340
 that typing the code then searches 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.310
 keep this result low 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.099
 that works already had beauty that's it 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.509
 any doubt put there in the year 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.509
 gave a description is that dolce 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.509
 Abracadabra
