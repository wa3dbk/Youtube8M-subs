00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.290
 Tim Schrick 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.460
 I am very keen on his profession autotester 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.460
 sure because I know exactly what I can 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.270
 of course, too 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.070
 But Tim is not on four wheels 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.270
 reliant 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.239
 who knows himself with two-wheelers 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:53.769
 very well and that since his 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:53.769
 childhood in front of the house 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.610
 So I took that opportunity 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.700
 and there is a slim and there I am 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.309
 with my tuned to 2.8 or 3 ps 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.990
 Just moped in the broken meadow in the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.789
 mud with totally smooth tires around 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.229
 slipped and I just have it 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.060
 learned to slide forward I am 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.530
 fell about 16 million times 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.759
 I have so much instead of 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.830
 to do homework so many 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.000
 I had two training sessions 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.990
 definitely do not bother on the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 I am not 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.229
 tired of life I know where my limits 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.229
 That's why I can just have fun and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 today picture in our test with the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.250
 kawasaki z1000 and the ktm super duke 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.490
 have fun in the beginning makes the super 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.490
 Type 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.159
 two cylinders 120 ps 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.050
 the right one for carefree 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.050
 Bug robbers in the country 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.750
 so preferably actually country roads 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.920
 because there are all possible curve radii 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 Exit motorway 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.520
 Tim is uncompromising in his tests 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.290
 he spares neither himself nor the ktm and 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.870
 will soon find his very own 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.879
 judgment on the super duke 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.360
 this is a razor-sharp joke thing 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.040
 almost as if by itself went there was the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.480
 when you think you have long 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.349
 want to drive the thing can be 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.349
 operate intuitively 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.819
 disadvantages I find that the engine 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 by then actually considered one 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.489
 Air pump is there just belongs 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.560
 real motor one 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.000
 which is really really powerful 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.640
 of course that is already so 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 compared to other motorcycles 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.780
 the thing is super fun so you can 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.060
 somehow drive in the first gear 60 and 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.590
 just create the thing and are on 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.000
 then switch through and then if you 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.250
 want to fold down front wheel again 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.370
 and that should be fun 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.870
 Nevertheless, the engine could be essential 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.890
 be better so from the history and 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.890
 also from a top performance ago 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 if something consumes so much gasoline 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 Actually , that 's not what it is 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.760
 is still topped I'm six 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.110
 years later with a fine of Munich 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.299
 Copenhagen and driven back 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 he had no idea 10 5 liters 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.799
 I had thought of consumption 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.840
 we can go right in the car and the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.069
 great duke this is the second motorcycle 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.069
 what ever met 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.900
 and then it's time to change now 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.230
 the new kawasaki z1000 show something in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.230
 you are 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.710
 and whether they claim the allies 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.580
 our problem 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.580
 that can do justice 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.800
 with four cylinders and 125 ps crashes 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.810
 tim on the highway the z 1000 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.669
 is a comeback but unfortunately that is 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.980
 current model visually a victim of 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.230
 euro 3 standard two coarse 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.180
 end pipes so far deface that 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.180
 filigree breeches japanese 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.700
 the z1000 has compared to 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.740
 predecessor model a knee 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.740
 stayed translated and is with it 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.210
 sparkling for our adrenalin junkie 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.630
 and two-cylinder fan tim Schrick 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.080
 but not biting enough 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:00.950
 The cover is so aggressive looking 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.250
 What I have noticed is remarkable 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.050
 find is that the motorcycle scary 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.960
 so it's easy to use 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.950
 somehow get up and you drive and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.740
 I did not have to get used to it 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.360
 I think the performance of 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.710
 that of such a four-cylinder and also 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.940
 of the current 1000 are the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.480
 performance is so close 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.520
 unspectacular that to electric motor moderately 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.920
 and I like more such a blatant 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.870
 powerful middle and out anyway 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.040
 also an extra trowel and that without 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.050
 Character that the cashier has buck 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.130
 a four-cylinder but the offer 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.130
 actually only two cylinders 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.020
 Altenburger but switch that one 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.560
 really under 30 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.910
 can drive in the sixth gear and then 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.300
 speeds up the thing can also be quite 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.350
 continuously keeps up to 100 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.900
 I think that's real 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.630
 it's really incredible because it's just that way 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.400
 a four-cylinder will keep many better 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.080
 that is, it has a more even force delivery 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.890
 The thing is so blatant for me is that 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.890
 beginner motorcycle 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.530
 So who the topic motorcycle already 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.910
 is more familiar and buck has on the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.700
 to annoy the country yogurt cup 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.560
 that should access and therefore mine 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.560
 Test winner the super duke
