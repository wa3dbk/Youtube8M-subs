00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
also clip this little braid out of the
way<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.470> start<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.130> making

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
way and you're gonna start off by making

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.420 
way and you're gonna start off by making
a<00:01:35.670> regular<00:01:35.909> Dutch<00:01:36.450> braid<00:01:37.040> for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> couple<00:01:38.369> of

passes until you get past your ear and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.490 
passes until you get past your ear and
then<00:01:41.430> you're<00:01:41.790> gonna<00:01:41.880> switch<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> Dutch<00:01:42.899> lace

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
then you're gonna switch to a Dutch lace

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920 
then you're gonna switch to a Dutch lace
braids<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.520> Dutch<00:01:44.700> braid<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> adding<00:01:45.720> hair

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
braids so the Dutch braid is adding hair

braids so the Dutch braid is adding hair
into<00:01:46.140> both<00:01:46.439> sides<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> braid<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.990> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
into both sides of the braid and the

sides of the braid and there's a reason

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.970 
sides of the braid and there's a reason
why<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.959> for<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.410> particular

why it's like this for this particular

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.380 
why it's like this for this particular
style<00:02:21.250> usually<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.819> just<00:02:21.880> kind<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.300> that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
style usually it's just kind of that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.490 
style usually it's just kind of that
lace<00:02:22.630> braid<00:02:22.989> but<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.370> need<00:02:24.550> some<00:02:24.819> space<00:02:25.500> here

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
lace braid but you need some space here

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
for the braids that are at the end and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.870 
for the braids that are at the end and
that<00:02:29.709> will<00:02:29.890> make<00:02:30.010> sense<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.549> end<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.790> my

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
that will make sense at the end of my

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.340 
that will make sense at the end of my
video<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:31.959> kind<00:02:32.170> of

actually<00:03:54.000> don't<00:03:54.420> really<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.900> what's

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
actually don't really know it what's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.840 
actually don't really know it what's
going<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.650> her<00:03:55.770> ponytail<00:03:56.130> because<00:03:56.640> she

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
going on with her ponytail because she

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.790 
going on with her ponytail because she
had<00:03:57.030> some<00:03:57.360> sort<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.630> costume<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.410> cloak

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
had some sort of costume like a cloak

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.990 
had some sort of costume like a cloak
that<00:03:59.730> covered<00:04:00.209> everything<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.140> was<00:04:01.290> loose

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that covered everything that was loose

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.120 
that covered everything that was loose
so<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.030> only<00:04:03.330> got<00:04:03.600> like<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.840> shot<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> side<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
so I only got like a shot of the side of

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.520 
so I only got like a shot of the side of
her<00:04:05.190> head<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:06.090> I'm<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.690> assuming<00:04:07.020> that<00:04:07.260> all

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
her head but I'm just assuming that all

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.110 
her head but I'm just assuming that all
of<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.739> hair<00:04:07.770> was<00:04:08.100> sort<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.370> tied<00:04:08.580> together<00:04:08.760> in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
of the hair was sort of tied together in

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.949 
of the hair was sort of tied together in
this<00:04:09.270> ponytail<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.940> whatever<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.270> think<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
this ponytail and whatever I think the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.540 
this ponytail and whatever I think the
point<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.410> kind<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.739> cool<00:04:13.890> now<00:04:14.100> what<00:04:14.430> you're

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
point is kind of cool now what you're

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.060 
point is kind of cool now what you're
gonna<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.970> with<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.900> rest<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.440> hair<00:04:16.680> here

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
gonna do with the rest of this hair here

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.340 
gonna do with the rest of this hair here
to<00:04:17.280> create<00:04:17.579> these<00:04:17.700> braids<00:04:18.030> on<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.359> side<00:04:18.570> is

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
to create these braids on this side is

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.990 
to create these braids on this side is
you're<00:04:19.530> going<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.830> split<00:04:20.070> your<00:04:20.250> ponytail<00:04:20.760> into

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you're going to split your ponytail into

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.870 
you're going to split your ponytail into
two<00:04:21.120> pieces<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.280> don't<00:04:23.669> want<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
two pieces and then you don't want to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.880 
two pieces and then you don't want to
take<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> lot<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.419> hair<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.810> just<00:04:24.930> want<00:04:25.020> enough

hair from the bottom of the ponytail

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.350 
hair from the bottom of the ponytail
that<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.419> create<00:04:30.780> two<00:04:31.650> small<00:04:32.100> braids<00:04:32.430> so

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
that you can create two small braids so

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.000 
that you can create two small braids so
like<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.750> should<00:04:33.960> be<00:04:34.080> enough<00:04:34.290> for<00:04:34.320> me<00:04:34.650> just

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
like that should be enough for me just

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.230 
like that should be enough for me just
going<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.430> clip<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.479> up<00:04:37.520> with<00:04:38.520> these<00:04:38.760> sort<00:04:39.150> of

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
going to clip it up with these sort of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.690 
going to clip it up with these sort of
little<00:04:39.419> clips<00:04:40.820> because<00:04:42.680> they<00:04:43.680> don't<00:04:43.890> snag<00:04:44.340> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
little clips because they don't snag and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.630 
little clips because they don't snag and
I<00:04:44.940> love<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.600> about<00:04:45.720> them<00:04:46.250> there's<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.400> my

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
I love that about them there's like my

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.090 
I love that about them there's like my
claw<00:04:47.880> clips<00:04:48.270> kind<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.600> get<00:04:48.720> stuck<00:04:49.229> my<00:04:49.919> hair

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
claw clips kind of get stuck my hair

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.250 
claw clips kind of get stuck my hair
gets<00:04:50.280> stuck<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.790> teeth<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.270> them<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:52.080> this

gets stuck on the teeth of them but this

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.570 
gets stuck on the teeth of them but this
you're<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.710> going<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:52.950> divide<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.460> evenly

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you're just going to divide it evenly

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.510 
you're just going to divide it evenly
into<00:04:53.970> two<00:04:54.210> pieces<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:55.280> breathe<00:04:56.280> both

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
into two pieces and breathe both

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.280 
into two pieces and breathe both
sections<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.240> then<00:04:57.330> tie<00:04:57.540> them<00:04:57.690> with<00:04:57.720> small

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
sections and then tie them with small

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.710 
sections and then tie them with small
little<00:04:58.560> elastics

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.180 

with<00:05:02.720> these<00:05:02.900> two<00:05:03.140> small<00:05:03.440> braids<00:05:03.770> you're<00:05:03.980> going

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
with these two small braids you're going

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.310 
with these two small braids you're going
to<00:05:04.280> create<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.760> shape<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.300> will<00:05:05.690> fill<00:05:05.960> up<00:05:06.140> this

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
to create a shape that will fill up this

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.130 
to create a shape that will fill up this
space<00:05:06.650> here<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.760> basically<00:05:08.240> I'm<00:05:08.600> just<00:05:08.690> going

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
space here so basically I'm just going

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.320 
space here so basically I'm just going
to<00:05:09.260> pull<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.710> braid<00:05:09.920> out<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:12.800> that<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:14.210> I

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
to pull the braid out like that and I

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.910 
to pull the braid out like that and I
want<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.780> be<00:05:14.900> flat<00:05:15.200> like<00:05:15.350> against<00:05:15.980> my<00:05:16.160> head

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
want it to be flat like against my head

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.860 
want it to be flat like against my head
and<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:21.470> can<00:05:21.740> use<00:05:21.950> this<00:05:22.250> braid<00:05:22.670> as<00:05:23.090> an<00:05:23.240> anchor

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
and you can use this braid as an anchor

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.960 
and you can use this braid as an anchor
when<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.170> pin<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:25.430> it'll<00:05:25.640> look<00:05:25.760> something

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
when you pin so it'll look something

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.130 
when you pin so it'll look something
like<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.130> keeping<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:28.280> flat<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.960> just

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
like that and keeping it flat you just

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.760 
like that and keeping it flat you just
want<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.350> loop<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.860> back<00:05:31.870> around<00:05:32.870> like<00:05:33.320> that

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
want to loop it back around like that

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.400 
want to loop it back around like that
and<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.240> reason<00:05:35.540> why<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.690> tied<00:05:36.050> all<00:05:36.290> of

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
and that's the reason why I tied all of

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.260 
and that's the reason why I tied all of
the<00:05:36.530> loose<00:05:36.710> hair<00:05:36.920> in<00:05:37.220> with<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.640> braids<00:05:37.910> of<00:05:38.150> the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
the loose hair in with the braids of the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.790 
the loose hair in with the braids of the
ponytail<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:38.960> way<00:05:39.080> I'd<00:05:39.200> have<00:05:39.410> this<00:05:39.590> hair

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
ponytail that way I'd have this hair

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.040 
ponytail that way I'd have this hair
kind<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.100> like<00:05:40.160> an<00:05:40.640> anchor<00:05:41.270> as<00:05:41.450> well<00:05:41.660> for<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
kind of like an anchor as well for the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.340 
kind of like an anchor as well for the
bobby<00:05:42.260> pins<00:05:46.450> with<00:05:47.450> the<00:05:47.600> two<00:05:47.810> little<00:05:48.080> loose

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
bobby pins with the two little loose

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.720 
bobby pins with the two little loose
ends<00:05:48.830> here<00:05:49.390> you<00:05:50.390> could<00:05:50.660> just<00:05:50.990> pin<00:05:51.410> them<00:05:51.730> which

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
ends here you could just pin them which

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.250 
ends here you could just pin them which
is<00:05:52.880> what<00:05:53.060> I<00:05:53.090> might<00:05:53.390> do<00:05:53.570> because<00:05:53.900> my<00:05:54.050> hair<00:05:54.230> is

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
is what I might do because my hair is

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.600 
is what I might do because my hair is
not<00:05:54.350> that<00:05:54.530> long<00:05:54.950> but<00:05:55.160> if<00:05:55.280> your<00:05:55.430> hair<00:05:55.550> was

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
not that long but if your hair was

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.060 
not that long but if your hair was
longer<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:56.840> could<00:05:57.020> kind<00:05:57.230> of<00:05:57.290> tie<00:05:57.800> them

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
longer you could kind of tie them

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.970 
longer you could kind of tie them
together<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:59.110> unravel<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.470> rest<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.830> your

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
together and unravel the rest of your

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.590 
together and unravel the rest of your
hair<00:06:01.160> so<00:06:01.670> that<00:06:01.700> it<00:06:01.850> would<00:06:02.030> blend<00:06:02.240> with<00:06:02.450> the

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
hair so that it would blend with the

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.420 
hair so that it would blend with the
ponytail<00:06:03.140> I<00:06:03.350> think<00:06:03.590> this<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.980> first<00:06:04.160> time

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
ponytail I think this is the first time

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.280 
ponytail I think this is the first time
I've<00:06:04.580> ever<00:06:04.610> had<00:06:05.000> to<00:06:05.150> use<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.300> bobby<00:06:05.600> pin<00:06:05.750> for<00:06:06.260> a

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
I've ever had to use a bobby pin for a

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.130 
I've ever had to use a bobby pin for a
Denarius<00:06:06.620> style<00:06:07.210> but<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.330> really<00:06:08.570> like<00:06:08.750> it<00:06:08.780> it's

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
Denarius style but I really like it it's

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.950 
Denarius style but I really like it it's
pretty<00:06:09.440> much<00:06:09.620> her<00:06:10.340> normal<00:06:10.820> braids<00:06:11.330> except

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
pretty much her normal braids except

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.600 
pretty much her normal braids except
that<00:06:12.080> there's<00:06:12.260> just<00:06:12.410> like<00:06:12.620> little<00:06:12.650> variation

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
that there's just like little variation

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.850 
that there's just like little variation
and<00:06:13.820> it<00:06:13.970> actually<00:06:14.360> isn't<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:15.110> hard<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.650> sort

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
and it actually isn't that hard to sort

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.070 
and it actually isn't that hard to sort
