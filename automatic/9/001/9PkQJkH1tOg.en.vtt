you can use the leftover plastic off
your<00:00:25.890> note5<00:00:26.400> box<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.119> today<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
your note5 box so today we're going to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
your note5 box so today we're going to
go<00:00:27.750> ahead<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.050> try<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> experiment<00:00:28.830> I'm

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
go ahead and try the experiment I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.470 
go ahead and try the experiment I'm
going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> go<00:00:29.820> ahead<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.029> put<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.269> backwards

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
going to go ahead and put it backwards

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.840 
going to go ahead and put it backwards
get<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> stuck<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:32.070> more<00:00:32.279> time<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
get it stuck just one more time and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.370 
get it stuck just one more time and
we're<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> cut<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.780> part<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we're going to cut out a little part of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.770 
we're going to cut out a little part of
this<00:00:34.590> film<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> stick<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this film here and stick it in there and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
this film here and stick it in there and
hopefully<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> easy<00:00:38.129> solution

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
hopefully that will be the easy solution

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190 
hopefully that will be the easy solution
so<00:00:38.969> let's<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.270> ahead<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.420> try<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> let's<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.050> do

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
come out this is what happens just do it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
very gently you can see that my sensor

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
very gently you can see that my sensor
is<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.890> working<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> jerk<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
is still working now if you jerk this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
is still working now if you jerk this
off<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.619> sensor<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> break

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
off all your sensor is going to break

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
off all your sensor is going to break
you're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> disassemble<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you're going to have to disassemble it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010 
you're going to have to disassemble it
so<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> stuck<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.450> leave<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so if you do get it stuck just leave it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.350 
so if you do get it stuck just leave it
there<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.979> try<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.729> next<00:01:18.270> I'm

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there do not try to pull it out next I'm

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600 
there do not try to pull it out next I'm
going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.720> ahead<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> cut<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.280> little

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
going to go ahead and cut out a little

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
going to go ahead and cut out a little
film<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.960> should<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.009> around

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
film it should go all the way around

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.499 
film it should go all the way around
like<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:26.000> sensor<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
like this because the sensor is on this

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
like this because the sensor is on this
side<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.619> lock<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> side<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
side the other lock is on this side so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
side the other lock is on this side so
it<00:01:30.210> should<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.530> 270<00:01:32.460> degrees

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it should actually go about 270 degrees

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.390 
it should actually go about 270 degrees
around<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.810> s-pen<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> roughly

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
around the s-pen so just do a roughly

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
around the s-pen so just do a roughly
about<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.820> maybe<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.600> half<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.229> inch<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
about there maybe like half an inch I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 
about there maybe like half an inch I
would<00:01:41.040> say<00:01:41.280> alright<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> always<00:01:42.840> cut<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
would say alright you can always cut it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.890 
would say alright you can always cut it
again<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> let<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.189> ahead<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.399> cut<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.770 

and<00:01:50.530> I'm<00:01:50.950> shaking<00:01:51.400> because<00:01:51.640> I'm<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.690> my

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and I'm shaking because I'm this is my

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.650 
and I'm shaking because I'm this is my
first<00:01:53.020> time<00:01:53.200> trying<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.680> hope<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.100> works

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
first time trying I hope it works

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.850 
first time trying I hope it works
otherwise<00:01:55.660> I'm<00:01:55.840> going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> be<00:01:56.170> pissed<00:01:56.440> I'm

otherwise I'm going to be pissed I'm
gonna<00:01:56.980> have<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.190> disassemble<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.820> again

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
gonna have to disassemble it again

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
slowly push it in keeping it as straight

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.010 
slowly push it in keeping it as straight
as<00:02:59.950> possible<00:03:06.300> I'm<00:03:07.300> going<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> pull<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> out<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
as possible I'm going to pull it out a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.750 
as possible I'm going to pull it out a
little<00:03:08.290> bit<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.130> kind<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.400> force

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
little bit and then just kind of force

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.360 
little bit and then just kind of force
in<00:03:10.000> until<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.720> stops<00:03:11.020> pull<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> little<00:03:12.040> bit

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
in until it stops pull out a little bit

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.030 
in until it stops pull out a little bit
so<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.610> have<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> little<00:03:13.030> momentum<00:03:13.800> pull<00:03:14.800> out

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so you have a little momentum pull out

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.760 
so you have a little momentum pull out
and<00:03:15.459> push<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.930> will<00:03:17.050> help<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.380> go<00:03:17.590> all

and push in and that will help it go all

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.060 
and push in and that will help it go all
the<00:03:17.920> way<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.239> pull<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.480> push<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:22.800> pull<00:03:23.800> out

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
the way and pull out push in pull out

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.970 
the way and pull out push in pull out
and<00:03:24.660> push<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:25.900> sort<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.410> kind<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.739> make<00:03:26.950> a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
and push in sort of kind of make a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.490 
and push in sort of kind of make a
