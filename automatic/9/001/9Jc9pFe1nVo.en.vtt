knife<00:02:15.530> let<00:02:16.190> me<00:02:16.310> measure<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.760> blade<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.420> egg

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
knife let me measure this blade for egg

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.940 
knife let me measure this blade for egg
it<00:02:17.720> out<00:02:17.840> by<00:02:18.050> my<00:02:18.769> tape<00:02:19.069> measure<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.800> I'm

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
it out by my tape measure and I'm

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.979 
it out by my tape measure and I'm
getting<00:02:22.310> about<00:02:22.610> about<00:02:23.390> four<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.959> half

inches<00:02:24.819> for<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:25.970> blade<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> pretty

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
inches for that blade so it's a pretty

me to do in certain cases you have to

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.330 
me to do in certain cases you have to
turn<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.780> knife<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.319> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> lot<00:02:55.310> of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
turn that knife and if you have a lot of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.759 
turn that knife and if you have a lot of
sub<00:02:56.030> hilts<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.690> grooves<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.290> swords

sub hilts and grooves and swords
sometimes<00:02:58.579> that<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.410> cumbersome

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
sometimes that can be cumbersome

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.930 
sometimes that can be cumbersome
especially<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:01.099> you<00:03:01.220> want<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.519> use<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> reverse

Locker and it has this little this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.460 
Locker and it has this little this
little<00:03:13.610> switch<00:03:13.819> here<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.750> what<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.989> does<00:03:15.170> is

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
little switch here and what it does is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.740 
little switch here and what it does is
it<00:03:15.590> pushes<00:03:15.799> this<00:03:16.190> little<00:03:16.459> switch<00:03:16.670> forward<00:03:17.030> as

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
it pushes this little switch forward as

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.789 
it pushes this little switch forward as
you<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.049> see<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.870> latch<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.530> that

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
you can see and that that latch is that

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.030 
you can see and that that latch is that
so<00:03:22.549> there's<00:03:22.700> no<00:03:22.910> way<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.930> can<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.350> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
so there's no way that you can on you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.699 
so there's no way that you can on you
can<00:03:25.220> unlock<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:25.609> but<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.569> basically<00:03:26.810> pushes

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
can unlock that but it basically pushes

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.970 
can unlock that but it basically pushes
a<00:03:28.010> piece<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.400> metal<00:03:28.609> in<00:03:29.500> interferes<00:03:30.500> with<00:03:30.799> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
a piece of metal in interferes with this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.009 
a piece of metal in interferes with this
process<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:32.090> an<00:03:32.239> impossibility<00:03:32.810> for

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
process so this is an impossibility for

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.650 
process so this is an impossibility for
this<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.410> be<00:03:33.530> closed<00:03:33.859> up<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:34.609> this<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.819> not<00:03:35.150> in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
this to be closed up so this is not in

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.660 
this to be closed up so this is not in
this<00:03:35.840> configuration<00:03:36.260> now<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.310> not<00:03:37.459> going<00:03:37.579> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
this configuration now is not going to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.280 
this configuration now is not going to
close<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.209> your<00:03:38.359> fingers<00:03:38.690> regardless

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
close up on your fingers regardless

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.220 
close up on your fingers regardless
it'll<00:03:39.889> break<00:03:40.069> off<00:03:40.310> first<00:03:40.730> before<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.209> does<00:03:41.450> so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
it'll break off first before it does so

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.990 
it'll break off first before it does so
that<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.650> essentially<00:03:43.130> turns<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.730> into<00:03:43.880> a

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that is essentially turns it into a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.720 
that is essentially turns it into a
fixed<00:03:44.359> blade<00:03:44.510> in<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.810> instance<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.040> is

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
fixed blade in that instance and that is

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.410 
fixed blade in that instance and that is
an<00:03:47.030> intuitive<00:03:47.889> placement<00:03:48.889> of<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.220> device<00:03:50.090> to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
an intuitive placement of that device to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.400 
an intuitive placement of that device to
because<00:03:50.690> your<00:03:50.840> hands<00:03:51.049> are<00:03:51.170> going<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.319> go

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
because your hands are going to go

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.080

of the time you're going to go ahead and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.860 
of the time you're going to go ahead and
you're<00:03:58.160> going<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.400> engage<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:59.150> unit<00:03:59.569> without

you're going to engage that unit without
