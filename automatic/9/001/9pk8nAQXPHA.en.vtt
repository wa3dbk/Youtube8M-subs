good because you don't have any heat in
the<00:00:32.740> bottom<00:00:33.100> so<00:00:33.580> I<00:00:33.610> come<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.240> edge<00:00:34.360> of<00:00:34.570> the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
the bottom so I come to the edge of the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.060 
the bottom so I come to the edge of the
rim<00:00:35.020> pile<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.410> I'll<00:00:35.500> build<00:00:35.710> up<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:35.920> little

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
rim pile and I'll build up a little

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.799 
rim pile and I'll build up a little
pallet<00:00:36.790> kind<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.180> little<00:00:37.360> crisscross

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
pallet kind of a little crisscross

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.770 
pallet kind of a little crisscross
pallet<00:00:38.290> deal<00:00:38.440> with<00:00:39.309> dry<00:00:39.640> kindling<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.300> then

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
pallet deal with dry kindling and then

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.120 
pallet deal with dry kindling and then
just<00:00:40.989> take<00:00:41.140> my<00:00:41.290> time<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.680> just<00:00:41.830> feed<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.100> like

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
just take my time and just feed it like

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.040 
just take my time and just feed it like
I<00:00:42.309> would<00:00:42.460> have<00:00:42.520> not<00:00:42.700> nice<00:00:42.910> fire<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.690> then<00:00:43.930> once

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
I would have not nice fire and then once

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020 
I would have not nice fire and then once
I<00:00:44.140> get<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.350> good<00:00:44.410> base<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:44.890> charcoals<00:00:45.489> here<00:00:45.760> it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
I get a good base of charcoals here it

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:58.620 
I get a good base of charcoals here it
will<00:00:46.239> take<00:00:46.420> off

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.150 

so<00:00:59.630> I<00:00:59.660> started<00:01:00.020> my<00:01:00.140> slash<00:01:00.410> pile<00:01:00.680> burning<00:01:01.040> on

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
so I started my slash pile burning on

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.530 
so I started my slash pile burning on
the<00:01:01.250> bottom<00:01:01.580> side<00:01:01.790> because<00:01:02.150> this<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.510> a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
the bottom side because this is on a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.810 
the bottom side because this is on a
pretty<00:01:02.780> good<00:01:02.960> slope<00:01:03.290> fire<00:01:03.860> burns<00:01:04.190> uphill<00:01:04.610> much

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
pretty good slope fire burns uphill much

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.940 
pretty good slope fire burns uphill much
faster<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> faster<00:01:05.540> than<00:01:05.840> downhill<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.830> when

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
faster the faster than downhill and when

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.800 
faster the faster than downhill and when
you<00:01:07.040> have<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> tremendous<00:01:08.060> amount<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.450> brush<00:01:08.630> to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
you have a tremendous amount of brush to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.810 
you have a tremendous amount of brush to
burn<00:01:08.990> like<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.740> particular<00:01:09.979> pile<00:01:10.580> is

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
burn like this this particular pile is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.960 
burn like this this particular pile is
about<00:01:11.090> 40<00:01:11.600> feet<00:01:11.840> long<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.410> about<00:01:13.310> seven<00:01:13.729> feet

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
about 40 feet long and about seven feet

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.000 
about 40 feet long and about seven feet
high<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.930> can<00:01:15.080> see<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.470> I've<00:01:15.560> got<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:15.950> a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
high you can see that I've got it in a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.460

long<00:01:16.280> row<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.450> were<00:01:17.570> just<00:01:17.690> burnt<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.170> or

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
long row if this were just burnt in or

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.380

thrown<00:01:18.920> up<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.130> one<00:01:19.310> huge<00:01:19.580> pile<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.150> would

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
thrown up in one huge pile this would

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.630 
thrown up in one huge pile this would
just<00:01:20.600> put<00:01:20.930> off<00:01:21.050> so<00:01:21.410> much<00:01:21.680> heat<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.100> then<00:01:22.550> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
just put off so much heat and then it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.310 
just put off so much heat and then it
runs<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> risk<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.210> damaging<00:01:23.720> trees<00:01:23.990> around

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
runs the risk of damaging trees around

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.440

it<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.830> getting<00:01:25.130> uncontrolled<00:01:25.820> getting

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450

it just getting uncontrolled getting
away<00:01:26.660> from<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.050> so<00:01:27.590> having<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.160> in<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.369> long<00:01:28.580> row

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
away from you so having it in a long row

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.690 
away from you so having it in a long row
like<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.720> kind<00:01:30.050> of<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.229> fuse<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.430> wick

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
like this is kind of a fuse like a wick

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.060 
like this is kind of a fuse like a wick
so<00:01:32.300> it'll<00:01:32.750> start<00:01:32.930> burning<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.440> one<00:01:33.649> end<00:01:33.860> and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.279

then<00:01:34.520> it'll<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:34.789> slowly<00:01:35.300> creep<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.110> hill

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
then it'll just slowly creep up the hill

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.560 
then it'll just slowly creep up the hill
and<00:01:36.500> creep<00:01:36.649> along<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.280> burn<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:37.970> burn
