00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.480
 good afternoon boys now going 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.049
 let us recall the knowledge of the 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.869
 previous lessons and already learned in 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.280
 first class and primary schools and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.610
 we will be clear are yellow the blue and the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.610
 red 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.720
 then mine also says that in the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.750
 Next class let's talk about colors 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.090
 and we said that the founders 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.960
 joined together with a primary color 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.370
 with another confirm and we have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 example the ring that muscled together and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.040
 God 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.370
 these two with the primary ones gave a 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.710
 secondary thing that was converted 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.089
 let's come in how does this get 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 passed through 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.240
 the yellow and the blue and to listen let's do 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.310
 experience and again to remember the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.380
 previous class yellow 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.380
 we have for more yellow 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 joining here to stay open 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.840
 Well, there it is. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.049
 not and here we have the green 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.790
 Look there, now we'll see the colors. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.890
 special 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.220
 then we have seen the primary accounts 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.920
 with the founders then goes the things 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.310
 said the police and the police 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.750
 hotels by adding a primary color with a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.600
 secondary thing 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.930
 in this case an example we have of color 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.080
 primary is yellow and became secondary 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.900
 the green ready we will then see what is the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:30.660
 color area we obtain by putting these 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:30.660
 two daniel 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.710
 add this yellow primary color and 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.960
 plans to join a portion of the green area 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.170
 course with the green area we saw 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.500
 previously resulted from mixing the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.670
 blue yellow and now let's see it happen 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.950
 area results from the Amaral with the government now 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.890
 will is that we have and realize is that although 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.320
 in this example the merial with the green of the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.280
 over the tamar the act that I got 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.170
 here in this blog experience and 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.770
 we have with a door the example of a 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.770
 tertiary thing
