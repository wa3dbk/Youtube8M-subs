you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.649> you're<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.640> many<00:00:53.820> illnesses<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you know you're so many illnesses it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
you know you're so many illnesses it
really<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.100> extraordinary<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
really is extraordinary and I think that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
really is extraordinary and I think that
you<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.840> tapping<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.710> power<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.609> what

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you know tapping into that power is what

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
you know tapping into that power is what
makes<00:01:00.329> our<00:01:00.660> brand<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.170> special<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.680> unique

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
makes our brand so special and unique

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
makes our brand so special and unique
but<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.699> what's<00:01:02.850> most<00:01:03.329> important<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but I think what's most important is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.790 
but I think what's most important is
that<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.710> connect<00:01:05.550> for<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.850> consumer<00:01:06.740> how<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
that we connect for the consumer how to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100 
that we connect for the consumer how to
look<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.399> nature<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.509> nature<00:01:09.899> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
look at nature and how to use nature and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
look at nature and how to use nature and
that<00:01:10.259> for<00:01:10.710> us<00:01:10.860> combining<00:01:11.700> nature<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.090> science

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that for us combining nature and science

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
that for us combining nature and science
is<00:01:12.509> critically<00:01:12.869> important<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.560> think

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is critically important because I think

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
is critically important because I think
that's<00:01:13.830> what's<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.759> important<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.630> making

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that's what's so important is making

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's what's so important is making
products<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.240> good<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
products that are good for you and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.730 
products that are good for you and
effective

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280 

so<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.100> think<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.540> someone<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.960> take<00:01:26.110> care

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
so I think is for someone to take care

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.950 
so I think is for someone to take care
of<00:01:26.350> their<00:01:26.500> skin<00:01:26.680> well<00:01:26.980> they<00:01:27.310> need<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.930> know

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
of their skin well they need to you know

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.990 
of their skin well they need to you know
have<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.230> ritual<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.010> really<00:01:30.310> be<00:01:30.430> dedicated

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
have a ritual and really be dedicated

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.210 
have a ritual and really be dedicated
because<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.450> think<00:01:31.510> that<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:31.990> many<00:01:32.050> women<00:01:32.560> you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
because I think that so many women you

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
because I think that so many women you
know<00:01:33.340> say<00:01:33.520> they<00:01:33.640> don't<00:01:33.820> have<00:01:33.910> time<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.210> they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
know say they don't have time and they

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.630 
know say they don't have time and they
don't<00:01:34.990> spend<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> time<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:35.980> I<00:01:36.220> think<00:01:36.460> that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
don't spend the time and I think that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.120 
don't spend the time and I think that
you<00:01:36.820> know<00:01:36.940> taking<00:01:37.870> care<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.080> your<00:01:38.200> skin<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.560> so

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
you know taking care of your skin is so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.280 
you know taking care of your skin is so
important<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.670> preventing<00:01:40.270> any<00:01:40.780> issues

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
important in preventing any issues

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.870 
important in preventing any issues
versus<00:01:41.710> saying<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:41.980> wake<00:01:42.190> up<00:01:42.340> one<00:01:42.490> morning<00:01:42.520> say

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
versus saying I wake up one morning say

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.730 
versus saying I wake up one morning say
oh<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:43.000> haven't<00:01:43.780> taken<00:01:43.960> care<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.230> it<00:01:44.380> for<00:01:44.560> years

would have been working at it for quite
a<00:03:46.990> few<00:03:47.200> years<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.560> being<00:03:47.890> able<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.250> create<00:03:48.730> an

a few years and being able to create an
anti-aging<00:03:50.320> serum<00:03:50.740> that<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.700> rival<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
results of an anti-wrinkle prescription

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.660 
results of an anti-wrinkle prescription
is<00:03:54.580> really<00:03:55.020> incredible<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:59.220> think<00:04:00.220> there's<00:04:00.610> a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
is really incredible I think there's a

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.100 
is really incredible I think there's a
lot<00:04:00.910> of<00:04:01.060> opportunity<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.720> know<00:04:01.870> when<00:04:02.020> you

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
lot of opportunity you know when you

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.140 
lot of opportunity you know when you
look<00:04:02.290> at<00:04:02.440> some<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.800> our<00:04:02.890> new<00:04:03.150> smartphones

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
look at some of our new smartphones

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.900 
look at some of our new smartphones
they're<00:04:04.900> smart<00:04:05.320> they're<00:04:05.560> intuitive<00:04:05.910> they're

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
they're smart they're intuitive they're

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.480 
they're smart they're intuitive they're
able<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:08.380> know<00:04:08.470> fit<00:04:08.650> into<00:04:08.800> your<00:04:08.980> lifestyle

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
able to you know fit into your lifestyle

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.370 
able to you know fit into your lifestyle
and<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:09.970> think<00:04:10.150> skincare<00:04:10.690> is<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.170> go<00:04:11.260> in

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
and I think skincare is going to go in

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.440 
and I think skincare is going to go in
that<00:04:11.500> way<00:04:11.680> as<00:04:11.890> well<00:04:12.070> but<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.850> think<00:04:13.120> it's<00:04:13.240> about

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
that way as well but I think it's about

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.000 
that way as well but I think it's about
how<00:04:13.570> do<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.720> make<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.320> your<00:04:14.710> skincare

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
how do you make it so that your skincare

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.520 
how do you make it so that your skincare
knows<00:04:15.430> where<00:04:15.730> your<00:04:15.970> oily<00:04:16.930> where<00:04:17.110> your<00:04:17.260> dry

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
knows where your oily where your dry

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.130 
knows where your oily where your dry
where<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:17.980> have<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:18.549> breakout<00:04:19.450> coming<00:04:19.959> and

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
where you have a breakout coming and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.500 
where you have a breakout coming and
thinking<00:04:20.980> at<00:04:21.160> itself<00:04:21.520> think<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.180> already

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
thinking at itself think so it already

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.240 
thinking at itself think so it already
anticipates<00:04:23.260> your<00:04:23.380> needs<00:04:23.590> how<00:04:23.770> do<00:04:23.830> we<00:04:23.980> do<00:04:24.100> that
