the hosts addressed was snakes inability

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470

players<00:04:27.070> fortunately<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.100> designers<00:04:28.669> are

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
players fortunately the designers are

players fortunately the designers are
working<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.419> address<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.960> issue<00:04:30.200> according

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
working to address this issue according

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.400 
working to address this issue according
to<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.370> hosts<00:04:31.729> in<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:32.150> phantom<00:04:32.510> pain<00:04:32.539> players

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
to the hosts in the phantom pain players

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.850 
to the hosts in the phantom pain players
will<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.770> able<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.160> do<00:04:34.400> something

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
will be able to do something

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.920 
will be able to do something
cool<00:04:35.129> to<00:04:35.520> lower<00:04:35.699> guards<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.270> their<00:04:36.419> position

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
cool to lower guards to their position

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.170 
cool to lower guards to their position
so<00:04:37.500> while<00:04:37.710> wall<00:04:37.979> knocking<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.610> unlikely<00:04:39.030> to

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
so while wall knocking is unlikely to

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.939 
so while wall knocking is unlikely to
make<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.449> return<00:04:39.810> there<00:04:40.349> will<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.590> something

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
make a return there will be something

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.730 
make a return there will be something
new<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> cool<00:04:41.909> to<00:04:42.210> take<00:04:42.360> its<00:04:42.569> place<00:04:42.629> if<00:04:43.199> I<00:04:43.560> had

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
new and cool to take its place if I had

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.409 
new and cool to take its place if I had
to<00:04:43.889> guess<00:04:44.069> I<00:04:44.340> would<00:04:44.370> say<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:45.030> could<00:04:45.240> be

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
to guess I would say it could be

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.999 
to guess I would say it could be
something<00:04:45.689> like<00:04:45.900> whispering<00:04:46.500> or<00:04:46.740> whistling

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
something like whispering or whistling

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.459 
something like whispering or whistling
or<00:04:47.699> since<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.360> hosts<00:04:48.689> keep<00:04:48.960> using<00:04:49.199> the<00:04:49.439> word

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
or since the hosts keep using the word

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.040 
or since the hosts keep using the word
cool<00:04:50.069> perhaps<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:51.060> has<00:04:51.180> something<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.719> do<00:04:51.870> with

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
cool perhaps it has something to do with

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.260 
cool perhaps it has something to do with
an<00:04:52.139> undisclosed<00:04:52.830> feature<00:04:53.250> found<00:04:53.699> in<00:04:53.939> snakes

an undisclosed feature found in snakes
prosthetic<00:04:54.750> arm<00:04:55.139> your<00:04:55.830> guess<00:04:56.069> is<00:04:56.099> as<00:04:56.310> good<00:04:56.490> as

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
prosthetic arm your guess is as good as

well good news folks the host took the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.619 
well good news folks the host took the

it's<00:05:09.270> hard<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:09.659> say<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.169> item<00:05:10.500> will<00:05:10.650> work

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
it's hard to say if the item will work

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.730 
it's hard to say if the item will work
