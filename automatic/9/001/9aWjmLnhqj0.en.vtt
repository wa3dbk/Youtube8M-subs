 play but now the game is early 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.669
 luckily this has been determined so that it is no longer clever inclusive 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.619
 Stocker free 1 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.610
 but not yet install because the installation is bound Battle net 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 and may be performed on Tuesday 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.050
 we also can 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 to look in Cacak 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 then comes a groan cardboard slipcase therefore 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.109
 that is cardboard slipcase Spansion 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.400
 for normal DVD case 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 with one on Klapka was 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.480
 that just burn even more easier for match better concealed 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 from India 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 Ricci on with all his glory Thomas Bruch 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.930
 what else can you open up? 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 for the total 360 Â° madness 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.940
 Pretty cool 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.340
 Fritz coined by Iris 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.110
 last power lettering 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.600
 where is it clear? 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 if not readable is imprinted 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.930
 Jentzen it starts 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.660
 fantastic 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.350
 we would probably last time 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 However, the dvd-box from it again additionally year in foil shrink-wrapped 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.979
 Kassier Schmaus tinkered and it is not obvious are allowed to lose 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 if the same again 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.350
 and refers 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.930
 he said identical 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.660
 alerted 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.850
 zwd KEF 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 manual 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.880
 next to the manual Sims 2 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.729
 try Bush seriously, too, but says to work 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.339
 he could basically become a shoplifter the only animal further surrendered then 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.469
 the full version documents and these either for seven hours 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.019
 or gamble for 15 days, whichever comes first 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.679
 and then he is also thoughtful and void to buy 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.179
 The same applies, of course, to a man who lives in front of Kraft vouchers 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.399
 the instructions 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.849
 is 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.199
 As the name indicates 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.149
 a guide for a quick start 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:42.579
 and 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.619
 the outer shell completely black white unfortunately 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.799
 because there are so beautiful downtrend this is here for 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.089
 example 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.479
 or the well-known Berlin 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.069
 and the paper quality 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.069
 The tips also impossible about 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.489
 I am afraid of a bad toilet paper level Nendeln addition, she is relative 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.629
 thin 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.859
 where and 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.069
 In principle very fancy because the story would be told 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.039
 what happened so far 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.489
 and give a half-day basic socializing with and always 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.599
 again so cool Art Works 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.400
 but then it really is a pity that in black and white Neuss 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.790
 For the targeted 60 Euro he is still waiting for you more normal 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.759
 a bit more 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.739
 currently is very nice 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.739
 on the Geest are 7 7 t-mobile at 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.119
 data available 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.679
 with you in the Explorer only 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.309
 So let's have the 20 MB or so ads for Activision 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:45.849
 Blizzard suitcase again 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:46.859
 cool technology 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.379
 seems to please 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.349
 that any hidden noon can promote a nuclear bomb and becomes 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.859
 can make 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.809
 Gates of Dawn family 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.709
 I have a bit of itacom and am looking forward to it on tuesday 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.079
 actually starts 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.549
 also very good 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.999
 and also the solo mode 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.839
 I hope so 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:10.879
 and 4 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.019
 he does that first time and
