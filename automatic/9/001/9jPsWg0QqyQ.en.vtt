00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 go through the stands see new items 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.289
 let's work the tools of one of the new products 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.390
 from the company had time is 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.279
 combi saw itself includes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.570
 jigsaw and saber saw 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.150
 be installed as a jig saw 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.270
 and for saber saw two positions 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.070
 By this instance is completely 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.079
 Absolutely new now try 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.649
 given to saw into action how is she 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.649
 works 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.500
 With this screw, we replaced 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.210
 file on an ordinary girl who 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.210
 used in all jigsaws 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.750
 one more novelty from skill to screwdriver 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.620
 10 and 8 volts 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:23.200
 very interesting shurik but honestly has 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.060
 a row let's say not accustomed to things for me 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.930
 the battery is rechargeable when charging 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.540
 power supply assistance has the direction 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.910
 rotation as you understand it is very necessary 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 thing where do without it without it 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.070
 indicator still wanted to say to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.770
 Unfortunately, the rotor rotates. 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.979
 the anchor itself is not blocked and to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.710
 need to replace the equipment of course here 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.190
 one hand hold the other twist here 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.320
 I think I will have such a screwdriver 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.870
 on a review of how the sale will be on sale 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 poet in half a year very many me on 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.260
 channel ask is suitable for 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.680
 cordless tool 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.479
 One day the world bosch batteries on it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 the question is just take the sea 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.330
 battery and insert it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.330
 dremel 8200 tool 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.770
 turn on as we see everything works 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.290
 answer here is presented somewhat from 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.790
 battery from time from bosch 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.820
 differ antiquity battery between 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.040
 a capacity of 1 tool which was 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.440
 used 1 and 3 ampere hours capacity 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 battery and then began to use on 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.390
 15 often and now you can buy 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.420
 a tool that is used 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.730
 batteries for 21 hours will not be able to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.630
 batteries fit battery on 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.090
 10 and 8 volts from the green series looks a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.940
 do not want as grammy but only have 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.790
 bosch designation is also here 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 presented appreciated series boshevskie 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.350
 batteries also rate the series 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.650
 tool as you can see they are landing 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.200
 the place is not the same therefore not suitable 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120
 so if you suddenly decide to buy 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
 bosch tool batteries 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 time please pay for it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.180
 attention another novelty is here 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.220
 such a drill tip which 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.830
 turns it 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.660
 3 punchers put a nozzle on the ventolux 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.660
 Now let's try how it works 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 as you can see cope without any 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.800
 auto problems and your discovered such 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.860
 interesting model bar typewriter 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.550
 on this 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.200
 or 8200 and are used by their 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.090
 batteries but the most remarkable 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.140
 the thing is that you can take this 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.450
 battery on the upper 4 hours and then it 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.220
 Charging you just enough for a long time now 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.350
 I want to do a little experiment with 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.400
 me in the hands of a cordless screwdriver 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.870
 bosch psr 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.500
 14 4 2 this review of this screwdriver 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.750
 dinner or team sends me on the channel 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.700
 remind of not looking in this surah 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.419
 sings an electronic clutch is used and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.690
 I want to check how evenly 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.930
 drives the screws into the tree is not an experiment 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.330
 I took 5 identical screws set 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.490
 arbitrary value on electronic 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.020
 music and now try to screw 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 some all these 5 self-tapping screws 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:49.579
 so as you can see the clutch disconnected 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:49.579
 next to drill the next screw 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.960
 on the other hand one more 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.279
 in the year these are not quite evenly i want 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.709
 conduct an experiment compare it to 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.179
 its makita and which ratchet 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.179
 ordinary not electronic 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.960
 open up
