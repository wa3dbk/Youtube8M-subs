00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so we are in a third already 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 said and then it would be typically raji 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 neeson that would fully respect 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.389
 the rules of acting nutrition 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.490
 and it will be the simplest we will do 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 so here I have amaranth grains 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.630
 biological and I have some grains of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.029
 organic buckwheat and so these two 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.000
 serials trying very anti acid go 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.490
 is cooked together and drawing from it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 seems more than Morocco 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 is a grain very concentrated in calcium 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 and who can be a little bit heavy on 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 the digestive system 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 if you just bought buckwheat 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.469
 easier to target and it makes a meal 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.629
 more balanced 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.000
 so I boiled at the same time 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.910
 here I have water that noise I'm going to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 bills at the same time and have what we 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 See you later when I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 will see if these seeds 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 ok so we will have wet we have very 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 Funny and our our buckwheat in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.780
 the ranks 5 minutes and we see that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 it's tender so do not forget 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.600
 still dream of whole grains at 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 less once during cooking 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.119
 we wait until the little foam is out 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.520
 grains and one creaks conquest to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.110
 through a trial match there would remain a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 little bit of water I do not know more serious 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 that in this case I will not let you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 a colander why because the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.680
 Amaranth seeds are so small 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.659
 that he thought through the colander 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.659
 so I will arrive with my technique 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.470
 there the train rather really as it is 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.600
 second cooking we have a little water 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.160
 only and we will put a lid 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.510
 and leave for five minutes 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.810
 finish cooking so tell it and 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.760
 cooked and then I show you in the end 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 so we see that buckwheat amaranth 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.780
 are really agglutinated together 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 the amarok a serial that becomes very 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 creamy 1 so the buckwheat seeds 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.030
 are among the lots eventually a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 individual portion for someone this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.870
 would be about the equivalent of 8 years a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.240
 cup with two steps of serial cooked and then 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.160
 on benefit for your health listen 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.990
 it sure as that's kind 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.250
 so it's totally raji ten years is 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.030
 in this way that I feed myself and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 to migrate more is what if you 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.540
 go get them an antacid side 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 foreskin years because buckwheat very 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.590
 anti acid and lucid amaranth 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.870
 antacids enormously so the masters 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.350
 both ways without adding sugar or 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 dried fruit or let's say decoration 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.800
 around that allows you to search the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.540
 maximum therapeutic effects of these 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.040
 foods water and acidity this is the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.209
 second most important factor that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.890
 for premature aging 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.780
 so if you manage to eliminate 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.239
 acidity with a rest like that you 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.070
 will win 100% and in addition some 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.020
 if you try it you will find that 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.820
 the texture is very nice so for 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.980
 do this you just need to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.080
 of whole amaranth sandstone and seeds 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.670
 buckwheat whole you boil them 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.120
 change the powerful and it's also 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.120
 simple that it
