00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.500
 I think that today the physical trainer Sergio Milk once and for all is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.050
 to prevent than to remedy for one more session of exercises it that today we 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.909
 Let's do a teamwork. 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.089
 pectoral exercise, let's try 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.349
 obama rejects all angles the thin cry gave up victor so let's go - 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 exists can be called the cricket world cup 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.839
 the arms passing from behind supported there we will form an angle of 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.240
 almost 90 degrees 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.070
 it is hard work and by force it is done not in the hands 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.659
 on the elbow 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.170
 gold will also work 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 piece 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
 with that spirit 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.290
 on the stage 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.500
 the bench press 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.519
 the variation 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.370
 if you have any problems take his legs protect the save 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.190
 if you have problems in the cervical sin you put both feet in the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.960
 ground and if you have no problem 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070
 I will do the conventional way according to the approved plans 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.910
 the tight 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 it will be a little longer than shoulder width 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.090
 the suhab athlete bending people left side 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.880
 You have to concentrate. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.060
 it will end up towards your chest and not physical 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.550
 you do not have to lean on the chest as well 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.580
 ninety degrees pain the angle 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.770
 the elbow 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 with the group is enough 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.159
 this variation of the bench press 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.469
 the bench press, but it turned out to be a private superior that is precisely 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.210
 at this point you are the titan using but as they hold seminar 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.579
 I chose this team to be good people who do not seem inclined either 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.100
 Are you going to work with Tevez? 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.550
 and make the move 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.280
 the bench press if you work with the / many times an arm that is stronger 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.640
 and he ends up leading to the bar and another just to follow 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.229
 in this case not in the two arms yesterday that make the same force the arm more 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.530
 weak will have to do a little more strength to compensate 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.229
 the force difference between the two arms, which 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.349
 the arms extended with the hands with the support of the prouni 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.600
 the proposal now 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.340
 the 4th pectoral exercise 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.029
 the cpj 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.319
 it's him 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.749
 It's true that you need to work. 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.900
 very balance because when you work with offer would be made 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.659
 proof that he opened his arms 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:34.889
 each position 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.069
 of the cross 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.230
 and then because of the position he occupies will show 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.330
 You're going to have to work with your legs up. 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.499
 You'll make an opening force. 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.959
 so do not have too much pressure on the cervical keita 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.079
 arms outstretched when you open your arm you will lightly 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.289
 pressed 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.399
 opening more 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.499
 can cause rain
