which<00:00:19.020> means<00:00:19.199> i<00:00:19.350> need<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> worry<00:00:19.920> about

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
which means i need to worry about

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.590 
which means i need to worry about
drought<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.769> standard<00:00:22.769> Charizard<00:00:23.250> set

aegislash<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.930> obvious<00:00:25.289> reasons<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.099> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
aegislash for obvious reasons and I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.870 
aegislash for obvious reasons and I
think<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.109> maybe<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.099> mean<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
think that maybe that's it I mean I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600 
think that maybe that's it I mean I

not not so much i mean maybe if i was
adamant<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.710> jolly<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.369> enough<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.570> he<00:01:57.600> goes

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
adamant but jolly not enough so he goes

exactly<00:04:33.380> what<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.590> do<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.800> knock<00:04:34.130> him<00:04:34.310> out<00:04:34.370> I

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
exactly what I do I knock him out I

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.500 
exactly what I do I knock him out I
don't<00:04:34.670> know<00:04:34.760> if<00:04:34.820> he<00:04:34.910> went<00:04:35.120> for<00:04:35.330> shadow

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
don't know if he went for shadow

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.970 
don't know if he went for shadow
sneaking<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:35.870> was<00:04:35.990> faster<00:04:36.320> or<00:04:36.440> something<00:04:36.740> but

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
sneaking I was faster or something but

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.100 
sneaking I was faster or something but
that<00:04:37.310> worked<00:04:37.520> out<00:04:37.640> pretty<00:04:37.700> well<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.810> he<00:04:38.960> goes

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that worked out pretty well so he goes

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.260 
that worked out pretty well so he goes
into<00:04:39.350> his<00:04:39.550> OG<00:04:40.550> slug<00:04:40.940> his<00:04:42.610> gastro<00:04:43.610> Don<00:04:43.730> yeah<00:04:44.000> and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
into his OG slug his gastro Don yeah and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.940 
into his OG slug his gastro Don yeah and
I<00:04:44.840> don't<00:04:45.020> think<00:04:45.200> I've<00:04:45.320> faced<00:04:45.560> too<00:04:45.710> many<00:04:45.860> of

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
I don't think I've faced too many of

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.280 
I don't think I've faced too many of
these<00:04:46.070> in<00:04:46.430> x<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.240> y<00:04:47.390> yet<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.080> will<00:04:48.200> be

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
these in x and y yet so this will be

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.570 
these in x and y yet so this will be
interesting<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:49.010> how<00:04:49.040> this<00:04:49.250> works<00:04:49.400> out

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
interesting to see how this works out

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.600 
interesting to see how this works out
and<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.620> leftovers<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.250> gonna<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.580> a

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
and I see the leftovers it's gonna be a

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.940 
and I see the leftovers it's gonna be a
stall<00:04:52.940> war<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.390> hopefully<00:04:54.200> with<00:04:54.350> my<00:04:54.470> massive

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
stall war but hopefully with my massive

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.350 
stall war but hopefully with my massive
attack<00:04:55.220> I'm<00:04:55.430> gonna<00:04:55.550> be<00:04:55.640> able<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:56.060> knock<00:04:56.180> him

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
attack I'm gonna be able to knock him

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.690 
attack I'm gonna be able to knock him
out<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.930> few<00:04:57.170> hits<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:58.070> does<00:04:58.430> look<00:04:58.670> like

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
out in a few hits so it does look like

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.180 
out in a few hits so it does look like
it<00:04:59.000> might<00:04:59.420> be<00:04:59.450> a<00:04:59.570> Fiat<00:04:59.870> KO<00:05:00.020> he<00:05:00.800> goes<00:05:00.980> force

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
it might be a Fiat KO he goes force

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.770 
it might be a Fiat KO he goes force
called<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.760> does<00:05:01.970> quite<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.480> bit<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.750> damage

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
called that does quite a bit of damage

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.370 
called that does quite a bit of damage
and<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:04.280> could<00:05:05.090> try<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.510> stall<00:05:05.690> with<00:05:05.960> leftovers

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
and I could try and stall with leftovers

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.350 
and I could try and stall with leftovers

that<00:06:09.980> he<00:06:10.340> would<00:06:10.520> not<00:06:10.700> be<00:06:10.820> able<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:11.210> beat<00:06:11.600> me<00:06:11.780> and

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
that he would not be able to beat me and

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.060 
that he would not be able to beat me and
I<00:06:12.080> would<00:06:12.200> have<00:06:12.260> been<00:06:12.380> able<00:06:12.440> to<00:06:12.590> widdle<00:06:12.860> him

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
I would have been able to widdle him

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.910 
I would have been able to widdle him
down<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.550> he<00:06:14.480> forfeited<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.200> match<00:06:15.350> but<00:06:15.710> you

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
down and he forfeited the match but you

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.460 
down and he forfeited the match but you
know<00:06:16.040> it's<00:06:16.460> okay<00:06:16.730> cuz<00:06:17.150> it's<00:06:17.570> there's<00:06:18.350> nothing

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
know it's okay cuz it's there's nothing

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.170 
know it's okay cuz it's there's nothing
wrong<00:06:18.740> with<00:06:18.800> forfeiting<00:06:19.460> when<00:06:19.670> you<00:06:19.970> know

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
wrong with forfeiting when you know

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.610 
wrong with forfeiting when you know
you're<00:06:20.450> going<00:06:20.570> to<00:06:20.630> lose<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.140> you<00:06:21.230> just<00:06:21.410> don't

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
you're going to lose and you just don't

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.660 
you're going to lose and you just don't
want<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.800> waste<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.100> time<00:06:22.250> when<00:06:22.520> it's

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
want to waste the time when it's

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.460 
want to waste the time when it's
probably<00:06:22.970> going<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> take<00:06:23.210> like<00:06:23.540> 20<00:06:24.140> or<00:06:24.260> 30

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
probably going to take like 20 or 30

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.200 
probably going to take like 20 or 30
more<00:06:24.650> turns<00:06:24.950> I<00:06:25.160> know<00:06:25.340> I'm<00:06:25.550> exaggerating<00:06:25.850> but

the weak ties into what just happened
what<00:06:34.970> do<00:06:35.030> you<00:06:35.120> guys<00:06:35.240> think<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.810> opponent<00:06:36.500> to

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650

forfeit<00:06:37.100> the<00:06:37.250> match<00:06:37.280> early<00:06:37.850> I<00:06:38.000> mean<00:06:38.330> sure<00:06:38.570> the

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
forfeit the match early I mean sure the

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.740 
forfeit the match early I mean sure the
saying<00:06:39.500> goes<00:06:39.800> never<00:06:40.520> give<00:06:40.760> up<00:06:40.790> and<00:06:41.240> sometimes

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
saying goes never give up and sometimes

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.910 
saying goes never give up and sometimes
that's<00:06:41.900> true<00:06:42.140> because<00:06:42.260> you<00:06:42.500> might<00:06:42.620> get<00:06:42.770> some

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
that's true because you might get some

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.550 
that's true because you might get some
hacks<00:06:43.190> or<00:06:43.490> maybe<00:06:44.330> you<00:06:44.690> out<00:06:44.840> speed<00:06:45.110> by<00:06:45.290> just<00:06:45.470> a

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
hacks or maybe you out speed by just a

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.400 
hacks or maybe you out speed by just a
little<00:06:45.950> bit<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.340> in<00:06:47.090> other<00:06:47.510> cases<00:06:47.600> like<00:06:48.200> this

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
little bit and in other cases like this

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.800 
little bit and in other cases like this
one<00:06:48.680> there<00:06:49.070> was<00:06:49.250> just<00:06:49.280> no<00:06:50.000> hope<00:06:50.210> for<00:06:50.540> winning

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
one there was just no hope for winning

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.710 
one there was just no hope for winning
unless<00:06:51.230> he<00:06:51.440> got<00:06:51.620> the<00:06:51.950> very<00:06:52.430> low<00:06:52.880> percent<00:06:53.420> hacks

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
unless he got the very low percent hacks

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.800 
unless he got the very low percent hacks
so<00:06:54.380> what<00:06:54.920> are<00:06:54.980> you<00:06:55.070> guys<00:06:55.190> opinion<00:06:55.790> on<00:06:55.910> that<00:06:56.060> I
