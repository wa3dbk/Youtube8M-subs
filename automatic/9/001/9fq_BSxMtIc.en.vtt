it's<00:01:20.770> easier<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.820> actually<00:01:22.300> just<00:01:22.740> pulverize

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
it's easier to actually just pulverize

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.480 
it's easier to actually just pulverize
it<00:01:23.770> I'm<00:01:24.460> gonna<00:01:24.730> pour<00:01:25.120> in<00:01:25.420> my<00:01:26.260> water<00:01:26.590> into<00:01:27.460> a

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
it I'm gonna pour in my water into a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.640 
it I'm gonna pour in my water into a
small<00:01:28.060> saucepan<00:01:28.420> over<00:01:29.970> medium<00:01:30.970> heat<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.930> then

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
small saucepan over medium heat and then

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.350 
small saucepan over medium heat and then
I<00:01:35.890> can<00:01:36.190> actually<00:01:36.640> just<00:01:36.850> use<00:01:37.090> my<00:01:38.070> rice<00:01:39.240> put<00:01:40.240> it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
I can actually just use my rice put it

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.410 
I can actually just use my rice put it
in<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.630> food<00:01:40.870> processor<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.760> let<00:01:42.760> it

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
in the food processor and let it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.770 
in the food processor and let it
pulverize<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.430> idea<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:46.120> for<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.630> become

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
pulverize the idea is for it to become

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.050 
pulverize the idea is for it to become
powdered<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.190> will<00:01:48.280> be<00:01:48.370> easier<00:01:48.730> for<00:01:48.820> your

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
powdered so that will be easier for your

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.620 
powdered so that will be easier for your
baby<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.420> actually

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.600 

so<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:59.990> times<00:02:00.990> vary<00:02:01.610> depends

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so there we have it times vary depends

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.429 
so there we have it times vary depends
on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> white<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> machine<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> using

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
these two to three minutes

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.460 
these two to three minutes
when<00:02:31.799> simmered<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:33.420> turn<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> down<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.440> low

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
constantly so you can get the the right

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.400 
constantly so you can get the the right
consistency<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.590> rice<00:02:43.910> let<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.060> cool<00:02:45.299> down

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
consistency of the rice let it cool down
