00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
bay and SATA ports and let's see if this

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:59.050 
bay and SATA ports and let's see if this
will<00:02:46.519> just<00:02:56.709> know<00:02:57.709> something<00:02:58.370> looks<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.909> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
will just know something looks like the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
will just know something looks like the
wireless<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.959> stuck<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.650> there

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.580 

okay<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.610> wireless<00:03:05.359> cable<00:03:06.019> right<00:03:06.170> here<00:03:06.230> was

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
okay the wireless cable right here was

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.110 
okay the wireless cable right here was
stuck<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.489> for<00:03:07.970> some<00:03:08.239> reason<00:03:10.120> we're

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
stuck on to that for some reason we're

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.960 
stuck on to that for some reason we're
gonna<00:03:11.239> put<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> single<00:03:11.989> sodimm<00:03:12.620> slot<00:03:13.040> here<00:03:13.519> and

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
gonna put a single sodimm slot here and

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.460 
gonna put a single sodimm slot here and
this<00:03:14.959> one<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.319> different<00:03:15.590> as<00:03:15.859> it<00:03:16.040> only<00:03:16.160> has<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
this one is different as it only has the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.960 
this one is different as it only has the
wireless<00:03:18.470> card<00:03:18.769> normally<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.430> would<00:03:19.579> be<00:03:19.609> an

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
wireless card normally there would be an

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.750 
wireless card normally there would be an
M<00:03:20.329> SATA<00:03:20.660> slot<00:03:21.049> for<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:21.379> M<00:03:21.739> set<00:03:22.129> a<00:03:22.160> solid-state

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
M SATA slot for a M set a solid-state

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.509 
M SATA slot for a M set a solid-state
drive<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.269> go<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:23.720> but<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.310> only

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
drive to go here but as this is only

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.069 
drive to go here but as this is only
$140<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.810> am<00:03:27.290> willing<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.650> live<00:03:27.890> without<00:03:28.040> that

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so I have my four gigs of RAM here and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:49.390 
so I have my four gigs of RAM here and
let's<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.359> can<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.799> put<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:48.400> don't

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
let's see we can just put this in don't

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:59.319 
let's see we can just put this in don't
want<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:49.639> mess<00:03:49.790> up<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.389> RAM<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.459> standard

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
want to mess up the RAM it is a standard

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:06.710 
want to mess up the RAM it is a standard
so-dimm<00:03:59.930> slot
