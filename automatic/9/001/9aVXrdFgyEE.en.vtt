 link or here below the video was recorded 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.899
 with a professional studio with musicians 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.399

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.430
 the second point is the songbook 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.980
 digital I every day I'm going to give 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.510
 classes to my students I go to the houses 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.310
 of my students and they ask me to 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 I teach you songs teach me teach me such 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.790
 song and I teach them the songs 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 that they ask me good because the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.740
 digital songbook is a website that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.930
 I made to give the same service that is 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 the people who register the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.640
 members can suggest which songs 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.100
 they want me to add to the songbook and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.909
 I'm adding videos explaining how 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.530
 play the songs that have me 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.749
 because many times his songs 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.689
 you can not find them on the web or 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.340
 you find tablatures things that are very 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.030
 complicated then I teach them of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.880
 a simple way how to do that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.010
 if you can not play guitar or hits 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 have some or many doubts or 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.950
 you learned is solita solitaire out there 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.869
 seeing things I advise you to take into account 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 the simple guitar course for 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.670
 beginners because if you go to youtube to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.960
 see how you touch in the introduction a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.360
 video of how the introduction of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.060
 a song just that you know how to play and no longer 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.149
 you know how to touch nothing else if you take 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.159
 an organized course step by step 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.690
 learning all the elements that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.030
 you need to know to be able to touch 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.380
 guitar well then when you see your 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.950
 favorite songs when downloads 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 or when they print the scores in the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.600
 scores of the readings sorry for 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.300
 the names of the chords and the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.430
 symbology of the tags and all that already 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.880
 you understand all those things and you know 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.620
 how to play all those things so you 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.530
 I recommend taking some of those 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.390
 options the last option already to go very 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.490
 it is quickly 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 the bulletin to remove time that arrives 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.209
 every week many people record their 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 mail here and collect the prize truth 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.600
 what selection with the chords of 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.700
 tablature software and they are removed from 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.590
 the list immediately because they do not know about 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.630
 what they are missing because the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.940
 Simple guitar weekly newsletter is a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.800
 newsletter that I write every week that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.800
 it takes me two hours to write them where 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.940
 I explain a lot of things 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.959
 related to the guitar with the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.380
 chords with questions of names of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.959
 chords of theory and I'll explain you 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.120
 music stuff that I would not learn from 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.709
 another way and they will serve you very much 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.100
 and also things that have to do with 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 the web then this considers staying 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.540
 and receiving the newsletter takes more than two 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.970
 hours write it every week and it has already 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.150
