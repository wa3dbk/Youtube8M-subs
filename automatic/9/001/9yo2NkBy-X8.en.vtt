00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.990
 greetings all hdblog readers spend 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.550
 lenovo we are with the new blake play 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.950
 10 hd plus 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.620
 it is a review of the del 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.920
 10 tablet yoga tablet we have 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.050
 seen in Milan about three months ago 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.150
 lenovo wanted to repeat it with this one 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.269
 plus version with full hd screen 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.659
 practically face fixing those who 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.449
 they had been the leaks of that one 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.539
 tablet that still had a good one 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.580
 also our response from the critics 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 if not for the processor that it was 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.920
 then of a soldier the 1.2 gigahertz 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.770
 at least for there for the conception of 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.330
 this rear kickstand that allows 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.490
 to support the tablet alone in two 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.280
 different positions both tilt mode and not 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.280
 it's the stand so this here is the tilt 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.150
 so that this is what this other one does 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.200
 particularly convenient for writing 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.030
 at least in our opinion 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.290
 we said the display so it is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 now we have a full hd gps display 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
 we tried it so much the previous one 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.300
 template 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.770
 so we can really appreciate 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.740
 the improvements 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.950
 with this solution we can finally 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.080
 have an acceptable full hd display 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.920
 we have a viewing angle 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.830
 practically 178 degrees like many of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.740
 ips good quality is under the body 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.540
 we have a 400 quad core snapdragon a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.000
 1.6 gigahertz let's go do a quick 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.320
 have not changed in the body la 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 key layout so we have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.690
 balance the microphone and jack volume 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 headphones in low profile always 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.240
 a very subtle feeling with 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.540
 this back cover in aluminum anyway 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 the whole body is well and well assembled 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.210
 on the left side we have nothing 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.770
 only the connector for charging 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.200
 super battery as in the version 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.020
 previous we have as many as 9,000 milian per 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.030
 they are all of them 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 then place the weight below 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.099
 has been distributed in this way 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.739
 it's unbalanced so we have possibilities 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.160
 to keep the tablet from the position 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.940
 let's say more where it is moved to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.040
 balance point and therefore we have one 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.950
 easy to hold with one hand 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.830
 definitely better let's get it back in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.790
 stand mode and look we have android 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.650
 4.3 the interface will be upgradeable 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.540
 obviously the owner lenovo 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860
 we tried to surf the unfortunately 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.799
 connection we saw that it is not 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.380
 particularly happy in this in 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.660
 this time, however, we will try it 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.540
 definitely more in depth in 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.450
 future therefore a good review of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 lenovo who arranged what we have 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.680
 said sorry we had forgotten the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.459
 5 megapixel and old camera 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.099
 model and now instead of 8 megapixels 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.840
 the two speakers are always positioned 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.920
 one left and one right laterally 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.090
 down 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 therefore a revisitation is a model 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.569
 that convinced us we 'll talk more 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.400
 in depth in the next ones 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.330
 weeks a greeting to all readers of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.330
