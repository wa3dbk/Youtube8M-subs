 hello everyone is made and we 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.130
 we found in kraft kit that thanks a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.869
 most premium server that I was testing 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.460
 enough during this time it takes 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.779
 pretty good a lot of people have 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.940
 promised and that he records on servers 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.180
 vital premium and approving this meal 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.739
 I say and I 'm not complaining it's going pretty well 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.050
 the achievement point 7 is the only 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.640
 inconvenience from 1.7 to 1.7 point 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.280
 days in total all those versions is 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.629
 where by means but to do it 1.7 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.090
 is quite level will serve is 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.980
 quite well- adapted bath the flow and 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.510
 as I say for people who 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.519
 I always ask for non-premium servers 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 I highly recommend this you will have the epe 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.879
 here below like the web in the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.620
 that if someone wants to be a moderator like 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.019
 go out here visit the web as there are 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 a virtual post tells you how to 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.320
 moderator of this server for people 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.210
 who wants to be a moderator, they know how to go 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.370
 the web and good is a server where there 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.839
 different modalities we have all 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.210
 You're here and I like the most 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.890
 logically is that of skye edwards on 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.420
 this and wars or pe but I really do not know 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.970
 moves very restless 2 at least 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.290
 pretty basic are pretty good what 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.450
 what I'm going to do is enter the game 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.159
 when they are starting I record again 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.750

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.299

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.369
 to go around here it's still worth 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.860

 had virtual I thought that how it kills 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.430
 as he marries thinking the machine in 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.720
 flat shows death but if there was 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.310

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.660
 put the normal zero to generate 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.910
 Contrast could arc because it did not give me 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 time to put on that because I'm imbecile and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.150

 The goal is that they are not 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.360
 administrators have even told me that 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.460
 I did not expect so much welcome that this 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.110
 server and I was denying quite 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.190
 the welcome that is having the thanks 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.600
 to the youtubers that are doing 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.040

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.930
 it is clear he is very happy that this 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.340
 go to more but you have to adapt 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.610
 everything so that there is at least is not 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.980
 possible that I want to die we go with the 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.990

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.540

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.160

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.590
 I recommend that you go through the server 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.360
 that the krafft has different 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.100
 normality and behind you can enter and 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.020
 look at all and as I say it goes a lot 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.130
 well I love playing here because there 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.510
 a variety of maps that what 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.940
 traveled with other servers download by 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.590
 example and I will upload more matches to boy in 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.060
 craft kits you know if I go to twitter 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.400
 because percent always notice when 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.510
