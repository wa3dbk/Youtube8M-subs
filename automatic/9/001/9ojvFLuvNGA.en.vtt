00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
of what was left on the walling

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.049 
of what was left on the walling
electrons<00:00:08.960> move<00:00:09.960> says<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> week<00:00:10.620> video<00:00:11.160> it

electrons move says a week video it
would<00:00:12.330> appear<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:14.420> bulky<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> board<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.139> my

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
would appear that a bulky in board is my

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.680 
would appear that a bulky in board is my
target<00:00:16.680> goal<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.940> strangely<00:00:18.420> enough<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
target goal so strangely enough I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.390 
target goal so strangely enough I
actually<00:00:18.810> came<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.740> move<00:00:19.949> sets<00:00:20.189> which

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
actually came up with to move sets which

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
actually came up with to move sets which
kind<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> makes<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.150> having<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> move

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
kind of makes up for not having to move

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
kind of makes up for not having to move
said<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.960> week<00:00:22.140> last<00:00:23.039> week<00:00:23.189> since<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.730> was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
gone so first one is a rest talk set and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.680 
gone so first one is a rest talk set and
the<00:00:30.570> other<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.080> you're<00:00:31.769> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.450> hoping<00:00:33.450> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
one is going to be a careful nature i

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
one is going to be a careful nature i
believe<00:00:45.059> i<00:00:45.300> need<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.200> check<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
believe i need to really check on that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.889 
believe i need to really check on that
just<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.280> sec<00:00:47.489> guys<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.390> i'll<00:00:48.510> tell<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> that

just a sec guys but i'll tell you that
moves<00:00:49.110> while<00:00:49.410> i'm<00:00:49.440> checking<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> nature

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
moves while i'm checking on the nature

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.729 
moves while i'm checking on the nature
because<00:00:51.390> i<00:00:51.510> did<00:00:51.719> forget<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.230> nature<00:00:53.629> i<00:00:54.739> guess

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
because i did forget what nature i guess

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
because i did forget what nature i guess
raise<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> special<00:00:57.090> defense<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> lower

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
raise a special defense and lower

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
raise a special defense and lower
special<00:00:58.649> tech<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:59.789> sure<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.210> careful

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
special tech pretty sure it's careful

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
special tech pretty sure it's careful
but<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.010> sure<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.430> you

but i just want to make sure for you
guys<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.870> ahead<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:07.490> first

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
guys so go ahead and get into the first

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
guys so go ahead and get into the first
move<00:01:08.760> set<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.430> bulk<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.500> then<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
move set which is bulk up and then I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
move set which is bulk up and then I
decided<00:01:14.010> body<00:01:14.250> sunless<00:01:14.670> best<00:01:14.939> probably<00:01:15.360> for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
decided body sunless best probably for

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
decided body sunless best probably for
just<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> parallax<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.560> its<00:01:17.280> everything

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
just the parallax in its everything

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
just the parallax in its everything
except<00:01:18.299> ghost<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.200> guess<00:01:19.890> maybe<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.580> can

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
except ghost but I guess maybe you can

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
except ghost but I guess maybe you can
substitute<00:01:20.970> body<00:01:21.420> slam<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.560> something<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
substitute body slam for something like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
substitute body slam for something like
Flame<00:01:23.759> Charge<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.240> flare<00:01:24.540> blitz<00:01:24.750> although

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
Flame Charge or flare blitz although

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.179 
Flame Charge or flare blitz although
flare<00:01:25.409> blitz<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.009> rather

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
flare blitz would be rather

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
flare blitz would be rather
unconventional<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.299> trying<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> make<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
unconventional if you trying to make a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.179 
unconventional if you trying to make a
bulky<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.130> board<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.600> wall<00:01:30.840> by

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
bulky in board and then you get wall by

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.080 
bulky in board and then you get wall by
prototypes<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> bad<00:01:32.880> thing<00:01:32.909> about

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
prototypes so that's the bad thing about

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.780 
prototypes so that's the bad thing about
this<00:01:33.420> rest<00:01:33.720> talk<00:01:34.380> set<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.369> wall<00:01:35.579> by

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this rest talk set is you get wall by

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
this rest talk set is you get wall by
either<00:01:35.939> ghost<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.479> fire<00:01:36.689> types<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.770> happen

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
either ghost or fire types that happen

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
either ghost or fire types that happen
have<00:01:38.250> flash<00:01:38.490> fire<00:01:39.110> um<00:01:40.189> which<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.310> rather

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have flash fire um which is rather

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.410 
have flash fire um which is rather
rather<00:01:42.060> disappointing<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.820> hold<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.909> just

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
rather disappointing and hold up just

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.109 
rather disappointing and hold up just
one<00:01:45.750> sick<00:01:46.110> oh<00:01:46.579> it's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> careful<00:01:50.700> sars

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
one sick oh it's a it is careful sars

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.429 
one sick oh it's a it is careful sars
correct<00:01:51.450> i<00:01:51.570> remembered<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.079> nature's

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
correct i remembered my nature's

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.719 
correct i remembered my nature's
correctly<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.520> that's<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
correctly that's good so that's the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
correctly that's good so that's the
first<00:01:56.880> move<00:01:57.119> set<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.600> v's<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> first

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
first move set the v's for the first

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.530 
first move set the v's for the first
move<00:01:58.649> set<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.850> second<00:02:00.180> moves<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> are

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
move set and the second moves that are

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.520 
move set and the second moves that are
the<00:02:00.719> same<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.380> 252<00:02:02.189> HP<00:02:02.780> 252<00:02:03.780> special<00:02:04.200> offense

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the same it's 252 HP 252 special offense

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.770 
the same it's 252 HP 252 special offense
and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.100> defense<00:02:05.689> because<00:02:06.689> you're

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and then for defense because you're

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.059 
and then for defense because you're
going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.990> bulking<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.740> you're<00:02:07.890> going

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to be bulking up so you're going

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.999 
going to be bulking up so you're going
to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.429> getting<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.789> defense<00:02:09.239> pretty<00:02:09.720> nicely

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to be getting your defense pretty nicely

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
to be getting your defense pretty nicely
and<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.519> lower<00:02:11.670> tiers<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.540> about

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and in the lower tiers it's all about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.610 
and in the lower tiers it's all about
what's<00:02:13.379> more<00:02:13.799> bulky<00:02:14.700> than<00:02:14.939> what's<00:02:15.269> an

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
what's more bulky than what's an

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.289 
what's more bulky than what's an
outright<00:02:16.620> faster<00:02:17.579> there's<00:02:17.909> not<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> lot<00:02:18.269> of

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
outright faster there's not a lot of

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.539 
outright faster there's not a lot of
sweepers<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> Lord<00:02:19.140> tears<00:02:19.409> but<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> few

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
sweepers and the Lord tears but the few

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
then the last one the less bulky more

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.449 
then the last one the less bulky more
offensive<00:02:32.280> set<00:02:32.489> um<00:02:33.269> would<00:02:33.959> actually<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:35.069> kind

lowers<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.810> speed<00:02:46.079> but<00:02:46.290> raises<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.680> attack

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
lowers you speed but raises your attack

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.349 
lowers you speed but raises your attack
in<00:02:47.220> defense<00:02:47.670> by<00:02:48.569> one<00:02:48.810> stage<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:50.120> since<00:02:51.120> in

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
in defense by one stage and since in

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.809 
in defense by one stage and since in
boar<00:02:51.540> has<00:02:51.780> access<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.470> gyro<00:02:52.709> ball<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.639> not

boar has access to gyro ball it's not
really<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> bad<00:02:54.329> move<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.840> run<00:02:55.079> because<00:02:55.319> steel

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
really a bad move to run because steel

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.430 
really a bad move to run because steel
hits<00:02:56.639> some<00:02:57.120> pretty<00:02:57.480> good<00:02:57.659> stuff<00:02:59.060> rather<00:03:00.060> than

you know other stuff the only problem
with<00:03:03.810> gyro<00:03:04.049> ball<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.769> know<00:03:04.889> like<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.700> said

faster<00:03:12.450> sweepers<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.709> have<00:03:13.889> a<00:03:14.099> reliable<00:03:14.430> way

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
faster sweepers you have a reliable way

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
speed and this this set should work

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.589 
speed and this this set should work
especially<00:03:41.040> well<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.639> trick<00:03:41.849> room<00:03:41.970> so

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
especially well in the trick room so

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.110 
especially well in the trick room so
like<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.750> said<00:03:42.900> cursing<00:03:43.470> terrible<00:03:43.919> pretty<00:03:44.849> good

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
like I said cursing terrible pretty good

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.939 
like I said cursing terrible pretty good
um<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.799> thing<00:03:47.069> about<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.549> though<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.949> you

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
um the thing about this though is you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.920 
um the thing about this though is you
don't<00:03:50.129> really<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.090> too<00:03:51.480> many<00:03:51.599> fire

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
don't really have like too many fire

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.990 
don't really have like too many fire
moves<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.530> flare<00:03:52.949> blitz<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.609> only<00:03:53.760> fire

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
moves like flare blitz is the only fire

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.449 
moves like flare blitz is the only fire
move<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.359> can<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.659> for<00:03:54.900> which<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.949> guess<00:03:56.250> would

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
move you can go for which I guess would

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.850 
move you can go for which I guess would
be<00:03:56.489> okay<00:03:56.909> if<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.510> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.959> want<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.530> bulky

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
be okay if you kind of want a bulky

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.550 
be okay if you kind of want a bulky
albeit<00:04:02.020> less<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:04.580> know<00:04:04.700> an<00:04:05.540> inboard<00:04:06.380> that

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
albeit less you know an inboard that

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.750 
albeit less you know an inboard that
isn't<00:04:06.980> able<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.490> do<00:04:08.270> as<00:04:08.390> much<00:04:08.540> damage<00:04:08.710> and<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
isn't able to do as much damage and I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.400 
isn't able to do as much damage and I
guess<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.210> could<00:04:11.240> do<00:04:11.480> heat<00:04:11.900> crash<00:04:12.200> though

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
guess you could do heat crash though

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.850 
guess you could do heat crash though
because<00:04:12.620> that's<00:04:13.520> based<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.060> targets<00:04:14.390> wait

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
because that's based on the targets wait

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.319 
because that's based on the targets wait
the<00:04:15.860> only<00:04:16.040> problem<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.430> getting<00:04:17.000> those

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
the only problem is getting those

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.210 
the only problem is getting those
heavier<00:04:17.630> pokemons<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:18.410> heat<00:04:18.620> crash<00:04:18.859> may<00:04:19.070> not

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
heavier pokemons so heat crash may not

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.590 
heavier pokemons so heat crash may not
be<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> best<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.910> would<00:04:19.940> be<00:04:20.120> better<00:04:20.239> than

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
be the best but it would be better than

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.400 
be the best but it would be better than
running<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.680> flare<00:04:22.070> blitz<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:22.610> then<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.930> for

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
running the flare blitz and then the for

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.370 
running the flare blitz and then the for
the<00:04:24.500> last<00:04:24.740> one<00:04:25.040> an<00:04:25.280> earthquake<00:04:25.870> should<00:04:26.870> just

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
the last one an earthquake should just

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.490 
the last one an earthquake should just
be<00:04:27.680> good<00:04:28.190> enough<00:04:28.460> for<00:04:28.780> recovery<00:04:29.780> covering

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
be good enough for recovery covering

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.230 
be good enough for recovery covering
move<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.890> should<00:04:31.100> give<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.370> pretty<00:04:31.850> decent

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
move that should give you pretty decent

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.210 
move that should give you pretty decent
coverage<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.560> only<00:04:33.740> thing<00:04:33.919> you'll

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
coverage and the only thing you'll

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.740 
coverage and the only thing you'll
really<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.490> worrying<00:04:34.850> about<00:04:34.880> our<00:04:35.180> water<00:04:35.450> types

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
really be worrying about our water types

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.840 
really be worrying about our water types
but<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.410> said<00:04:36.680> earthquake<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.490> got<00:04:37.669> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
but like you said earthquake you got the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.990 
but like you said earthquake you got the
water<00:04:38.030> types<00:04:38.300> for<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.610> recap<00:04:40.760> the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
water types for so just to recap the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.150 
water types for so just to recap the
second<00:04:41.780> move<00:04:41.900> set<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:42.320> is<00:04:42.500> curse<00:04:43.090> gyroball

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
second move set it is curse gyroball

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.690 
second move set it is curse gyroball
heat<00:04:46.160> crash<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:47.800> that's<00:04:48.800> my<00:04:48.980> phone<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.370> an

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
heat crash and a that's my phone and an

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.120 
heat crash and a that's my phone and an
earthquake<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.570> will<00:04:51.500> wrap<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.830> up<00:04:51.950> for

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
earthquake and that will wrap it up for

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.430 
earthquake and that will wrap it up for
the<00:04:52.310> second<00:04:52.820> moveset<00:04:53.150> leftovers<00:04:54.110> on<00:04:54.260> both

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
the second moveset leftovers on both

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.200 
the second moveset leftovers on both
sets<00:04:54.680> because<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:55.280> course<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.700> is<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> bulky

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
sets because of course it is a bulky

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.270 
sets because of course it is a bulky

special defense and for defense because

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.580 
special defense and for defense because
you<00:05:03.919> have<00:05:03.950> two<00:05:04.430> ways<00:05:04.640> of<00:05:05.000> raising<00:05:05.780> your

you have two ways of raising your

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
you have two ways of raising your
defense<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.030> don't<00:05:08.270> really<00:05:08.419> need

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
defense so you don't really need

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.330 
defense so you don't really need
anything<00:05:08.840> else<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.890> guys<00:05:10.010> have<00:05:10.220> any

instead of having to come up with
something<00:05:18.919> random<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.610> notice<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.270> guys<00:05:20.510> are
