00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 today I'm going to show you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.339
 how to start a diabolo so what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 I will do is first show you 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.420
 how to turn your table is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.010
 then how did the accident 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
 and that's more or less the basics 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 to acquire before trying to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.379
 anything else so to start 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.130
 you naturally need a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.529
 diabolo any one month it's 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 a green job that come from viella 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.439
 reese and a ball loss is there so 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.849
 with a string of course when you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 are beginner if you do not know too much 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 how to put the string I you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 advise to put more or less to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.239
 height shade it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
 me it's a lot higher because 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 from time to time a day there two or 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.760
 three diabolo so to speed up your 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.250
 hungry to run 24 bikes forgiveness 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 you have to roll it on the ground so 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.399
 if you are right handed you are going 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.079
 drive on the left 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 and if you're left-handed you're going to do 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.860
 to roll on the right me I am 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.190
 right-hander had to roll on the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.899
 left 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 then I go under the fact of the only 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.390
 and I will say pull on the wand 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.619
 right and on my ball with the baton 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 coach i'm just going to let 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 relations the proof the china so I 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.340
 draws with the right stick and the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.189
 left wand she saw herself she goes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 over so she lets go 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.820
 shoot like this and then you go you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.200
 cause to turn the pages 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 I do not think the news of the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.460
 first shot to do like that so a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 time you know well we'll learn to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.619
 accelerate to accelerate it just 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 pass the string around the lax of the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 diabolo like that we're going around and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 we know by and so there are several are 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 acceleration there I ask on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 the simple acceleration that you will have 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 need necessarily need more 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.399
 complicated at first so you do 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.750
 same as before with a turn on dax the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.630
 if it does not speed up it's just 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.240
 because there is more string 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.520
 on dax will be more stuff hooked 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.460
 and suddenly it will turn faster so 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600
 the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.159
 if you make a moment like this you 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.520
 can feel it vibrate me I feel 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.200
 destroy 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.840
 then once you but what 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.270
 that's how it depends on people it depends 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.700
 it can go from a few tries to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.819
 a few days and you have to have some 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 sales could bind others others 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.760
 things like for example launched diabolo 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 satellites or more figures 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.200
 complex so here I showed you 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.100
 how to start a diabolo mint 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.100
