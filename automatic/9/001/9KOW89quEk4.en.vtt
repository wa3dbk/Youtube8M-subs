00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hello everyone we are Halloween and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 that's why we have prepared several 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.710
 videos that will serve you as ideas 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.080
 first they are stuffed ghosts and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.289
 for this we are going to need ham 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 york cheese spread wafers to make 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.919
 dumplings a ketchup egg and paper 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.649
 albal the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.829
 take a piece of albal paper and we're going 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.930
 to make a wink to put over the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 We are going to mold it by hand 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.880
 as you can see and when we already have it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.310
 our taste we put the wafer over 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.350
 falling down making folds 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.350
 as if he were a ghost 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 once we have all the ghosts 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.930
 mounted the egg baths and the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.839
 we put in the oven we will have them from 10 to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.409
 15 minutes looking at them and when they are already 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.930
 we take it out and while they are in 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.799
 he in the oven we will take advantage to do 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 the filling and for this we cut the ham 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.640
 from york in very small pieces 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.920
 and once we have it all cut out 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.920
 we toss the cheese and mix everything 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.580
 once the time has passed we will take out 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.010
 our ghosts from the oven and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.530
 we will begin to unmold the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.540
 unmold the what we do will be throw 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.300
 strongly upwards but with 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.400
 Be careful not to break once 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 we will fill the mold with the mixture 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.840
 that we had prepared 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.570
 and finally to decorate them in this 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.770
 case I had a syringe and I put a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.070
 little ketchup and I made her eyes and 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.070
 the mouth 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.550
 once we have all the ghosts 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.700
 decorated we put them on a tray and 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.770
 we throw him some ketchup around 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.230
 simulating that it is blood and we already have 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.180
 our delicious ready ghosts 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.910
