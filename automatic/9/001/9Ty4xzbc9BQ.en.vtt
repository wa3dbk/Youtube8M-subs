manganese which is a mineral that

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.390 
manganese which is a mineral that
actually<00:01:02.170> helps<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.500> regulate<00:01:03.070> blood<00:01:03.280> sugar

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
actually helps to regulate blood sugar

levels plus like I said before high in

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.039 
levels plus like I said before high in
protein<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.490> fiber<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.420> helps<00:01:07.689> keep<00:01:07.840> us

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
protein and fiber so it helps keep us

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.139 
protein and fiber so it helps keep us
say<00:01:08.560> she<00:01:08.619> ated<00:01:08.950> for<00:01:09.130> longer<00:01:09.549> periods<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.090> time

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
little bit lighter and moister so that's

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.289 
little bit lighter and moister so that's
about<00:03:02.230> everything<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.980> wanted<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.340> cover<00:03:03.639> when

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
it comes to coconut flour I think that's

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.589 
it comes to coconut flour I think that's
the<00:03:06.400> basics<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.879> what<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.209> would<00:03:07.359> need<00:03:07.540> to
