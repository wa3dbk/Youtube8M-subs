00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello good everyone here was created 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.929
 we started today with the first tutorial of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.740
 industrial craft 2 or experimental the uis 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 the 658 and the minecraft version is the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.180
 1 7 10 every special mention I want to give 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.610
 thanks to the mister is light for his 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.010
 great support in the channel the truth that has 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.230
 done an excellent job has made me 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.090
 a new banner a new logo and also 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 new filters for videos with what 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.410
 which I am very happy and very many 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.620
 thanks from here I hope that people 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.350
 you see it anyway 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.780
 I will leave your twitter in the description of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.699
 video for us we are also interested 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.090
 who gave you a hand with me there what 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.920
 you have 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.710
 Well, we started with the concepts 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.170
 basic things first thing 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.800
 vanilla change at first the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.329
 Water 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.220
 it changes and now it can be destroyed with 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.930
 dynamite and with industrial dynamite 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.430
 it's just a minor change but 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 Well now you know what you can do 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.450
 that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 then he washes it because the lava also 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.050
 can destroy with dynamite and with 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
 industrial dynamite are two small 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.650
 changes but good simple andrade those 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.790
 total the change that has been made to the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.570
 rest is not that it now generates energy 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.270
 then you generate 500 of energy 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 measured in units of energy or bertÃ­n 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.930
 depending on whether it generates if 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.100
 store is so good and what of the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 I'll explain it a little more energy 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 forward of a more complete medium but 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 well just that you know what to talk 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.340
 subtracting the general then new items 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 that generate energy are burned in the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 generators that I'll do them but good 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.300
 simply what you know that generates 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.190
 energy of both the cactus and the cane 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.100
 of sugar generate 120 units of 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.560
 energy in total as you can see here is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.650
 they put down here and they burn and it generates 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.540
 energy as data also observe is 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.430
 that everything that can be measured one has 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.650
 a cooking oven also goes for 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.660
 generate energy but that already depends on 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.220
 the values that give you those values 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.450
 Right now I do not know them because I do not know 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.110
 I know it by heart but well that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.340
 you have the wiki that will also put 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.229
 the envy 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.939
 good new odors are generated 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.369
 four new types of errors I'm going to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.879
 speak carefully so nothing is going 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.750
 so quick copper copper copper 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.519
 is generated between layers 1070 and serves 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.440
 then to make cables circuits 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.420
 many things have many uses 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.209
 so it's a very important mineral 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 exposes to between 4 and 7 hours or so and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.239
 nothing so you can find what 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.129
 you have to search in these layers in team 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.410
 the team also serves to make 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.970
 cables to make machines to have 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.959
 also many uses are generated from the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.799
 layers of wax 40 and this unit then more 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.430
 or about four sensors so 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.860
 nothing 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.830
 and then we have him 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.420
 Lead that is generated in all caps or 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.250
 at least the times you played it 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.550
 found in all the layers I do not know if 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.370
 that influences a lot but basically 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.120
 are all layers are generated two or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.920
 three hours to see what pauner and serves 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.650
 basically to be able to do the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.270
 tractor plates that I'll explain 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.680
 carefully in a dedicated video 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.360
 exclusively to the reactor is together with 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.850
 the uranium but good simply that 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.480
 you know this is messing up then we have 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 the uranium that is used for the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 reactors you basically have to process it 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.700
 and such that also explain in another video 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.080
 but simply that you know that this 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.720
 they make the layers of cell 64 and 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.730
 simply because 12 hours appear as 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.370
 very much, it seems very little to me 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.230
 you have to look for it well then we have 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.880
 the basalt that the truth is that it does not 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.070
 I found no use I've been 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.050
 searching the internet and they have put it 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.540
 a little while ago I did not know not to find it 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.030
 but good 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.859
 did not find any specific use 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.989
 but good if someone knows that I 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.879
 I commented on the video and I will add it as 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.329
 a note for everyone to know 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:03.170
 what's the use then we have the trees 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.359
 rubber rubber trees are 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.010
 quite important because they give us what 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.470
 which is the rubber itself that is this 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.209
 intendant depending on the biome in the 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.730
 that is generated because it has a spa a raid 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.280
 an appearance basically where is 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.130
 way 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.990
 appears in the taiga biome among a 0 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.630
 and 6% in forest bioma that has a 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.419
 space reiterate more or less between a 6 and 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.400
 15% and in the swamps that there is 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.360
 where else is it that is between the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.470
 10 and 30% which is the important thing of 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.480
 these trees good for the most 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.270
 important really is this 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.250
 this is where the rubber is generated 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 what we need can not be caught 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.250
 either hand or do not not try it because there 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.900
 you can hold your hand you need a pair 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.320
 of items and objects that one is the tap and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.880
 the other is the electric extractor that 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.220
 I'll explain that later but 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.040
 good just to get it out and 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.940
 will give us this is put in an oven 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.890
 he gives us one rubber 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.800
 with which is quite because one of 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.690
 this is a bit sad process like that 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.490
 that the most important thing is to get this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.930
 machine that is the extractor that already 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.880
 I will explain when I explain the machines 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.720
 but just so you know it 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.240
 basic method of this here we have one 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.920
 but if this same one and we put it here we 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.480
 gives three with which we triple the 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.180
 production that are very important to 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.270
 all the first steps and then also 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.970
 these two here that is the seed and the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.890
 trunk if we also get into this 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.150
 machine can not be cooked but 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.040
 you have to put them in this machine where 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.250
 now also one rubber 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.930
 so between this this and this gives us a 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.110
 heap of rubber however only 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.880
 with the oven if we put it here will give us 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.100
 one rubber so it's very important 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.380
 and the fundamental partners of rubber 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.300
 They are coating tablets 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.590
 and good also a trampoline and 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.600
 no more thing but good that 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.510
 I will explain how in various things some 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.580
 video specifically for various uses 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.260
 of the objects but the most important 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.750
 I will explain them when they make the video 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.250
 of the wiring so nothing I hope that 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.690
 you liked this video and we already 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.130
 we see in the next video so nothing 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.130
 greetings until the next bye
