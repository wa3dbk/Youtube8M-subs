00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
burning it also shows you how much money
you're<00:02:04.170> losing<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> cast<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> know

next burn face should initiate which is
in<00:02:16.540> around<00:02:16.750> 94<00:02:17.290> seconds<00:02:17.800> which<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.940> obviously

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
in around 94 seconds which is obviously

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.630 
in around 94 seconds which is obviously
two<00:02:20.140> minutes<00:02:20.530> well<00:02:21.220> yeah<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.250> want<00:02:24.550> to

staying until a vacation comes off code

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.080 
staying until a vacation comes off code
out<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.500> yeah<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.490> really<00:02:39.940> good

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
out so yeah this this is a really good

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.230 
out so yeah this this is a really good
add-on<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.720> well<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:41.920> designed<00:02:42.550> for<00:02:42.670> majors

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
add-on for well it's designed for majors

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.620 
add-on for well it's designed for majors
in<00:02:43.390> general<00:02:43.960> but<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:45.150> think<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.330> going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.510> be

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
in general but I think it's going to be

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.690 
in general but I think it's going to be
more<00:02:46.840> specific<00:02:47.110> for<00:02:47.620> arcane<00:02:47.950> mages<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.580> be

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
more specific for arcane mages to be

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.920 
more specific for arcane mages to be
honest<00:02:49.000> as<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.480> seems<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.550> know<00:02:51.700> RK<00:02:52.600> majors

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
honest as it seems to you know RK majors

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.560 
honest as it seems to you know RK majors
require<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.290> fair<00:02:54.100> more<00:02:54.460> amount<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.060> mana

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
require a fair more amount of mana

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.090 
require a fair more amount of mana
management<00:02:56.200> than<00:02:56.500> either<00:02:57.430> fire<00:02:57.730> or<00:02:57.760> frost

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
management than either fire or frost

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.620 
management than either fire or frost
okay<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.490> we've<00:03:00.760> taken<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.180> look<00:03:01.210> at<00:03:01.450> what

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
okay so now we've taken a look at what

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.830 
okay so now we've taken a look at what
the<00:03:01.900> mage<00:03:02.470> mana<00:03:02.800> bar<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.400> useful<00:03:03.910> we'll<00:03:04.660> take<00:03:04.780> a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the mage mana bar is useful we'll take a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.810 
the mage mana bar is useful we'll take a
quick<00:03:05.080> look<00:03:05.230> at<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.500> configuration<00:03:06.430> for<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
quick look at the configuration for it

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.750 
quick look at the configuration for it
you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.960> enter<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.890> configuration<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you can enter the configuration for this

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.090 
you can enter the configuration for this
add-on<00:03:09.940> by<00:03:10.210> typing<00:03:10.600> /<00:03:10.960> mage<00:03:11.290> mana<00:03:11.590> bar<00:03:11.830> into

add-on by typing / mage mana bar into

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.670 
add-on by typing / mage mana bar into
your<00:03:12.220> chat<00:03:12.460> or<00:03:13.000> by<00:03:13.390> pressing<00:03:13.600> escape<00:03:14.020> going<00:03:14.590> to

your chat or by pressing escape going to
interface<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:15.550> add<00:03:15.760> ons<00:03:15.940> as<00:03:16.180> always

interface and then add ons as always

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.110 
interface and then add ons as always
okay<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.220> if<00:03:18.459> we're<00:03:18.670> looking<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
okay so if we're looking at the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.420 
okay so if we're looking at the
configuration<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.560> main<00:03:21.900> page<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.470> just

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
configuration here the main page is just

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.100 
configuration here the main page is just
about<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.820> general<00:03:25.270> looks<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.959> can

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
about the general looks of it so you can

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.130 
about the general looks of it so you can
change<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.560> scale<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.020> also

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
change the scale of it and you can also

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.360 
change the scale of it and you can also
change<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> different<00:03:29.890> widths<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.280> Heights

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
change the different widths and Heights

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.610 
change the different widths and Heights
and<00:03:30.700> also<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> different<00:03:31.540> textures<00:03:32.230> at<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
and also the different textures at the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.460 
and also the different textures at the
bar<00:03:32.800> uses<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.580> nothing<00:03:34.540> too<00:03:34.810> important<00:03:35.290> there

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
bar uses so nothing too important there

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.020 
bar uses so nothing too important there
unless<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.770> want<00:03:35.950> your<00:03:36.190> UI<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.610> look<00:03:36.880> all

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
unless you want your UI to look all

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.500 
unless you want your UI to look all
pretty<00:03:37.860> ok<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.490> we<00:03:40.060> now<00:03:40.180> look<00:03:40.209> at<00:03:40.420> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
pretty ok so if we now look at the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.840 
pretty ok so if we now look at the
marker<00:03:40.840> settings<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.340> probably<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
marker settings this is probably the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.060 
marker settings this is probably the
most<00:03:43.150> important<00:03:43.870> part<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.230> configuration<00:03:44.890> is

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
most important part of configuration is

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.370 
most important part of configuration is
here<00:03:45.400> you're<00:03:46.360> able<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.750> set<00:03:46.930> these<00:03:47.050> different

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
here you're able to set these different

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.910 
here you're able to set these different
markers<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.280> for<00:03:48.550> example<00:03:49.050> as<00:03:50.050> an<00:03:50.350> arcane<00:03:50.680> mage

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920
