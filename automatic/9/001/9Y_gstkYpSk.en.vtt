and I find multi team the spawn system

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.480 
and I find multi team the spawn system
is<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:45.630> sporadic<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.680> probably<00:01:47.070> most<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
is very sporadic which probably most you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
is very sporadic which probably most you
guys<00:01:47.670> don't<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> reason<00:01:49.229> why<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
guys don't like but the reason why I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
guys don't like but the reason why I
like<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.060> 6v6<00:01:51.840> team

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
like it is because in 6v6 team

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950 
like it is because in 6v6 team
deathmatch<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> kill<00:01:53.729> someone<00:01:54.000> most<00:01:54.810> of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
deathmatch when you kill someone most of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
deathmatch when you kill someone most of
the<00:01:55.020> time<00:01:55.290> he<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:56.159> spawn<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:57.060> his

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the time he will spawn with his

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.330 
the time he will spawn with his
teammates<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.170> other<00:01:58.350> side<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> map

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
teammates on the other side of the map

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
teammates on the other side of the map
and<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> run<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and then you have to run all the way to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.230 
and then you have to run all the way to
the<00:02:02.219> other<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> map<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> by<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the other side of the map and by the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
the other side of the map and by the
time<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.680> teammates<00:02:05.100> have

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
time you get there your teammates have

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620 
time you get there your teammates have
already<00:02:05.549> killed<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.420> I'm<00:02:06.509> trying

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
already killed them so what I'm trying

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.990 
already killed them so what I'm trying
to<00:02:06.810> say<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.439> regular<00:02:07.680> 66<00:02:08.550> team<00:02:08.789> deathmatch

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to say is in regular 66 team deathmatch

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
to say is in regular 66 team deathmatch
you<00:02:09.479> either<00:02:09.629> can't<00:02:10.080> find<00:02:10.349> your<00:02:10.500> enemy<00:02:10.830> your

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you either can't find your enemy your

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.089 
you either can't find your enemy your
teammates<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.300> kills

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
teammates take your kills

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.039 
teammates take your kills
or<00:02:13.159> you<00:02:13.640> run<00:02:13.819> into<00:02:14.090> campers<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.749> those

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
or you run into campers and those

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.129 
or you run into campers and those
factors<00:02:15.590> do<00:02:16.129> not<00:02:16.159> help<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.849> get<00:02:17.450> your<00:02:17.629> 20<00:02:17.900> kill

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
factors do not help you get your 20 kill

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.289 
factors do not help you get your 20 kill
streak<00:02:18.439> so<00:02:18.799> in<00:02:18.950> multi-team<00:02:19.579> it's<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:20.060> little

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
streak so in multi-team it's a little

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.209 
streak so in multi-team it's a little
different<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.989> will<00:02:21.109> still<00:02:21.379> have<00:02:21.560> campers

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
different you will still have campers

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.429 
different you will still have campers
but<00:02:22.909> since<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.269> have<00:02:23.450> three<00:02:23.780> teams<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.379> three

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
but since you have three teams of three

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.949 
but since you have three teams of three
the<00:02:25.249> spawn<00:02:25.549> system<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.239> different<00:02:26.719> when<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
the spawn system is different when you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.530 
the spawn system is different when you
kill<00:02:27.200> someone<00:02:27.499> most<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.519> time<00:02:28.760> he<00:02:29.359> will

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
kill someone most of the time he will

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.599 
kill someone most of the time he will
spawn<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:29.959> your<00:02:30.349> general<00:02:30.739> area<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.400> means

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
spawn in your general area so that means

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.129 
spawn in your general area so that means
you<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.329> have<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.569> waste<00:02:32.780> your<00:02:32.900> time

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
you don't have to waste your time

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.720 
you don't have to waste your time
running<00:02:33.650> around<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.920> map<00:02:34.069> trying<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.519> find

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
running around the map trying to find

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.580 
running around the map trying to find
your<00:02:34.849> next<00:02:35.060> target<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:35.689> if<00:02:36.109> you<00:02:36.200> look<00:02:36.349> at<00:02:36.469> my

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
your next target and if you look at my

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.399 
your next target and if you look at my
gameplay<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.370> only<00:02:37.909> played<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.569> one<00:02:38.810> half<00:02:39.139> of

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
gameplay I only played in one half of

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.039 
gameplay I only played in one half of
the<00:02:39.530> map<00:02:39.739> because<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.629> enemy<00:02:41.810> is

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
the map because I know the enemy is

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.289 
the map because I know the enemy is
always<00:02:42.319> going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:42.859> spawning<00:02:43.219> around<00:02:43.730> me<00:02:43.939> so

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
always going to be spawning around me so

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.670 
always going to be spawning around me so
if<00:02:44.450> you're<00:02:44.569> gonna<00:02:44.659> be<00:02:44.749> pulling<00:02:44.989> multi<00:02:45.439> team

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
if you're gonna be pulling multi team

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.319 
if you're gonna be pulling multi team

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
friends because communication is key and

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.250 
friends because communication is key and
you<00:02:50.090> will<00:02:50.209> notice<00:02:50.389> a<00:02:50.599> change<00:02:50.629> in<00:02:51.109> your

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
you will notice a change in your

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
but if you're playing by yourself I'll

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.800 
but if you're playing by yourself I'll
be<00:02:55.340> honest<00:02:55.669> I<00:02:55.819> don't<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.359> you're<00:02:56.629> gonna<00:02:56.719> be

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
doing that great because communication

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.709 
doing that great because communication
