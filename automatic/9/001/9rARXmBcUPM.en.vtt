 just landed the second bream and he 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.570
 thought it was necessary to say goodbye to my 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.010
 relying on to take a moment to hemp 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.560
 at first it seemed that it did 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.560
 it wasn't a good idea 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.870
 so clean pants and through 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.260
 I lowered it to throw in and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.940
 pike popped 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940
 very nice to have a look 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.450
 that's not what came for it and me 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.080

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.080
 your underline 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.940

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.130
 looks awakened from sleeping and eating her 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.080
 whistler 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.770

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.770

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:11.400

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.690

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.380

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.280
