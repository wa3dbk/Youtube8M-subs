were you happy first microprocessor I
got<00:00:24.560> was<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.770> C<00:00:25.010> leg<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.119> used<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.570> walking<00:00:26.930> on<00:00:27.440> a

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
got was a C leg so used to walking on a

on the shoe that was different
really<00:00:35.690> really<00:00:35.960> liked<00:00:36.200> it<00:00:36.380> I<00:00:37.000> have<00:00:38.000> worn<00:00:38.300> a

years and then for the past six years
I've<00:00:45.860> won<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.520> freedom<00:00:47.030> premium<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.649> it's

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
I've won the freedom premium but it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.569 
I've won the freedom premium but it's
biggest<00:00:49.280> difference<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:49.820> me<00:00:49.879> was<00:00:50.719> I<00:00:51.579> didn't

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
biggest difference for me was I didn't

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.819 
biggest difference for me was I didn't
get<00:00:52.760> feel<00:00:53.300> like<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.629> was<00:00:53.750> being<00:00:53.960> assisted<00:00:54.590> I

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
get feel like I was being assisted I

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.000 
get feel like I was being assisted I
felt<00:00:55.100> more<00:00:55.370> like<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.910> knew<00:00:56.180> intuitively<00:00:56.980> how<00:00:57.980> I

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
felt more like it knew intuitively how I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.490 
felt more like it knew intuitively how I
was<00:00:58.430> going<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.670> be<00:00:58.789> stepping<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.690> what<00:01:00.079> speed

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
was going to be stepping and what speed

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.509 
was going to be stepping and what speed
I<00:01:00.530> was<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.070> at<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.730> was<00:01:02.180> able<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.570> go<00:01:03.519> from

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
I was going at I was able to go from

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.109 
I was going at I was able to go from
slow<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.909> fast<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:05.509> absolutely<00:01:06.140> no<00:01:06.289> effort

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
slow to fast with absolutely no effort

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.199 
slow to fast with absolutely no effort
going<00:01:08.119> up<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.569> ramp<00:01:08.929> was<00:01:09.259> amazing<00:01:09.969> going<00:01:10.969> up

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.209 
going up the ramp was amazing going up

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.190 
going up the ramp was amazing going up
the<00:01:11.299> ramp<00:01:11.420> was<00:01:11.659> like<00:01:11.810> no<00:01:12.020> effort<00:01:12.380> at<00:01:12.469> all<00:01:12.649> and

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
the ramp was like no effort at all and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.980 
the ramp was like no effort at all and
going<00:01:15.200> down<00:01:15.380> was<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.159> lot<00:01:16.429> easier<00:01:16.459> -<00:01:17.119> oh<00:01:17.509> he's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
going down was a lot easier - oh he's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.129 
going down was a lot easier - oh he's
walking<00:01:18.409> -<00:01:18.829> did<00:01:19.209> very<00:01:20.209> little<00:01:20.509> very<00:01:21.079> little

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
walking - did very little very little

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.190 
walking - did very little very little
effort<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:22.009> go<00:01:22.369> through<00:01:22.639> and<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.779> amazing

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
effort to go through and the amazing

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.929 
effort to go through and the amazing
thing<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.409> has<00:01:24.679> been<00:01:24.979> going<00:01:25.039> up<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.729> ramp

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
thing that has been going up the ramp

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.629 
thing that has been going up the ramp
and<00:01:26.179> down<00:01:26.389> around<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.590> sea<00:01:27.740> lake<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.189> great

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
and down around the sea lake was a great

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.749 
and down around the sea lake was a great
great<00:01:29.270> product<00:01:29.899> for<00:01:30.469> it<00:01:30.649> today<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.429> it's<00:01:31.639> an

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
great product for it today but it's an

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.760 
great product for it today but it's an
outdated<00:01:32.179> product<00:01:32.779> now<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.439> I<00:01:33.709> think

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
outdated product now and and I think

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.649 
outdated product now and and I think
auto<00:01:34.189> bike<00:01:34.399> has<00:01:34.579> recognized<00:01:35.209> some<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
auto bike has recognized some of the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.080 
auto bike has recognized some of the
shortcomings<00:01:36.319> of<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:37.009> ceiling<00:01:37.459> a<00:01:37.639> lot<00:01:37.939> of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
shortcomings of the ceiling a lot of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.909 
shortcomings of the ceiling a lot of
users<00:01:38.450> were<00:01:38.630> trapped<00:01:38.929> in<00:01:39.109> a<00:01:39.200> certain<00:01:39.560> window

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:39.919 
users were trapped in a certain window

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.039 
users were trapped in a certain window
and<00:01:40.189> if<00:01:40.520> they<00:01:40.669> trying<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.029> walk<00:01:41.240> outside<00:01:41.509> that

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
and if they trying to walk outside that

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.830 
and if they trying to walk outside that
window<00:01:42.349> of<00:01:42.889> speed<00:01:43.459> whether<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.179> be<00:01:44.299> slow<00:01:44.630> or

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
window of speed whether it be slow or

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.229 
window of speed whether it be slow or
fast<00:01:45.169> they<00:01:45.859> could<00:01:45.919> not<00:01:46.219> ambulate<00:01:46.849> like<00:01:47.060> they

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
fast they could not ambulate like they

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.659 
fast they could not ambulate like they
wanted<00:01:47.599> to<00:01:47.719> think<00:01:47.959> they<00:01:48.139> felt<00:01:48.409> robotic<00:01:49.069> with

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:49.669 
wanted to think they felt robotic with

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.879 
wanted to think they felt robotic with
the<00:01:49.789> gin<00:01:49.999> IAM<00:01:50.179> what<00:01:50.719> I<00:01:50.749> think<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.409> have<00:01:51.590> found

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
the gin IAM what I think we have found

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.129 
the gin IAM what I think we have found
out<00:01:52.099> that<00:01:52.539> whereas<00:01:53.539> before<00:01:53.869> with<00:01:53.989> all<00:01:54.109> the

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
out that whereas before with all the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.260 
out that whereas before with all the
micro<00:01:54.590> processors<00:01:55.219> they're<00:01:55.520> working<00:01:56.119> off

micro processors they're working off

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.479

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
some kind of toe load the gin IAM

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.139 
some kind of toe load the gin IAM
actually<00:01:59.200> does<00:02:00.200> several<00:02:00.499> different

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
actually does several different

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.929 
actually does several different
calculations<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:03.229> know<00:02:03.349> but<00:02:03.679> between<00:02:04.039> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
calculations you know but between the

calculations you know but between the
the<00:02:05.929> gyroscopes<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.979> are<00:02:07.099> in<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.399> at<00:02:07.639> that

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:07.669 
the gyroscopes that are in it at that

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.479 
the gyroscopes that are in it at that
sense<00:02:08.270> where<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.750> knee<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.289> space<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:10.310> the
