this is the white finger compressor what

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.169 
this is the white finger compressor what

heavy<00:00:16.119> compression<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.710> have<00:00:17.920> LED<00:00:18.699> and<00:00:19.000> lamp

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
heavy compression you have LED and lamp

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.810 
heavy compression you have LED and lamp
for<00:00:19.840> fast<00:00:20.230> or<00:00:20.560> slower<00:00:20.800> attack<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.520> they've

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
for fast or slower attack and they've

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.300 
for fast or slower attack and they've
also<00:00:22.000> added<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.690> sensitivity<00:00:23.529> control<00:00:23.980> which

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
also added a sensitivity control which

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.730 
also added a sensitivity control which
is<00:00:24.340> similar<00:00:24.789> to<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.750> ratio<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.289> compression

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
optical circuit and we'll start with the
