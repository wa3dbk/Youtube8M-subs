00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
wrap I did notice that there was very

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.370

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.490 
myself
I<00:02:34.150> believe<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.690> got<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.990> both<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> them<00:02:35.440> for

I believe I got the both of them for

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.570 
I believe I got the both of them for
about<00:02:35.860> $30<00:02:37.050> which<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:38.830> expensive

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
about $30 which is kind of expensive

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120 
about $30 which is kind of expensive
relative<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.390> other<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.990> headwraps<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.860> can

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
relative to other like headwraps you can

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.580 
relative to other like headwraps you can
buy<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.240> reason<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.690> wanted<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.200> try<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
buy but the reason I wanted to try the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.000 
buy but the reason I wanted to try the
gym<00:02:45.190> rap<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.730> because

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
gym rap is because

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.000 
gym rap is because
and<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.640> actually<00:02:47.790> don't<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.780> right<00:02:48.900> now

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and I actually don't have it right now

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.949 
and I actually don't have it right now
the<00:02:50.670> gym<00:02:50.879> rep<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.390> actually<00:02:51.569> it's<00:02:51.840> more

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the gym rep you can actually it's more

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.420 
the gym rep you can actually it's more
like<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.170> scarf<00:02:52.590> where<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.040> wrap<00:02:53.250> it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
like a scarf where you can wrap it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.399 
like a scarf where you can wrap it
around<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.940> tie<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.510> adjust<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:55.019> some<00:02:55.290> of

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
around and tie it and adjust it some of

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.649 
around and tie it and adjust it some of
the<00:02:55.500> other<00:02:55.680> ones<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.099> I've<00:02:56.280> seen<00:02:56.659> it's

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
the other ones that I've seen it's

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.380 
the other ones that I've seen it's
pretty<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> rigid<00:03:00.090> shape

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
pretty much like a like a rigid shape

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.619 
pretty much like a like a rigid shape
and<00:03:00.810> that's<00:03:01.739> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> big<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.330> can't

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
and that's kind of big and so if I can't

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.660 
and that's kind of big and so if I can't
adjust<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.290> then<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.129> either

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
adjust it then it's going to be either

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
adjust it then it's going to be either
too<00:03:06.090> tight<00:03:06.120> form<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.049> probably<00:03:07.349> gonna<00:03:07.470> be

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
too tight form it was probably gonna be

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.920 
too tight form it was probably gonna be
too<00:03:07.680> tight<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.280> me<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.750> not

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
too tight for me and then that's not

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.600 
too tight for me and then that's not
gonna<00:03:10.019> be<00:03:10.200> comfortable<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> fact

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
gonna be comfortable so I like the fact

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.809 
gonna be comfortable so I like the fact
that<00:03:11.730> with<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.540> Savior<00:03:13.049> do<00:03:13.260> gym<00:03:13.500> wrap<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.190> could

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
that with the Savior do gym wrap I could

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.970 
that with the Savior do gym wrap I could
actually<00:03:15.000> adjust<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.720> now<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.019> here<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
actually adjust it now the here in the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.580 
actually adjust it now the here in the
back<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.840> don't<00:03:18.840> know<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.200> was<00:03:19.349> that<00:03:19.500> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
back I don't know if it was that I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
back I don't know if it was that I
wasn't<00:03:19.950> able<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.220> tie<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.760> well<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
wasn't able to tie it as well so the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.490 
wasn't able to tie it as well so the
hair<00:03:22.140> at<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.980> nape<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:23.579> neck
