on a diagonal around the iron now if you
want<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.140> tighter<00:00:31.619> curl<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.489> wrap<00:00:32.730> them

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
want a tighter curl you can wrap them

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.569 
want a tighter curl you can wrap them
tightly<00:00:33.210> together<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> loose<00:00:35.340> or

curl you can space them in between the
iron<00:00:48.770> we've<00:00:49.770> included<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.690> extensions<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
iron we've included some extensions to

iron we've included some extensions to
the<00:00:52.530> hair<00:00:52.860> today<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.789> add<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.329> bit<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the hair today just to add a bit of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.680 
the hair today just to add a bit of
thickness<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.340> her<00:00:56.670> natural<00:00:56.940> hair

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.189 

I<00:01:01.670> think<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.989> most

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I think you're going to get the most

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.620 
I think you're going to get the most
natural-looking<00:01:04.979> result<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> curl<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
natural-looking result if you curl it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
natural-looking result if you curl it
with<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> actual<00:01:07.590> hair<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.190> that's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.520> tip<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
with the actual hair so that's a tip I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
with the actual hair so that's a tip I
always<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> share<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.630> people<00:01:09.810> who<00:01:10.170> do

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
always like to share with people who do

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.460 
always like to share with people who do
use<00:01:10.619> extensions<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.700> clip<00:01:12.150> ins<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:13.290> those

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
use extensions a lot clip ins get those

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.320 
use extensions a lot clip ins get those
extensions<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> hair<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.210> then

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
extensions in the hair first and then

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
extensions in the hair first and then
style<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.399> your<00:01:17.399> natural<00:01:17.880> hair<00:01:19.430> we're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
style it with your natural hair we're

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.350 
style it with your natural hair we're
just<00:01:20.580> taking<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.090> dressing<00:01:21.630> brush<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
just taking a dressing brush now and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
just taking a dressing brush now and
brushing<00:01:24.360> through<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.899> waves<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
brushing through the waves and what

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
brushing through the waves and what
that's<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.060> create<00:01:27.840> less<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.440> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that's going to do is create less of a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.029 
that's going to do is create less of a
defined<00:01:28.950> curl<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.149> just<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:31.039> softer

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
defined curl and more of just a softer

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.910 
defined curl and more of just a softer
wave<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> hair<00:01:35.630> add<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:37.140> volume<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.740> by

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
wave to the hair add some volume in by

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
wave to the hair add some volume in by
doing<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> backcombing<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
doing a little bit of backcombing in the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.820 
doing a little bit of backcombing in the
crown<00:01:39.899> area<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.440> hold<00:01:43.679> more

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
crown area and then you can hold more

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.580 
crown area and then you can hold more
direct<00:01:44.130> everything<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.929> use<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.319> brush

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
direct everything back and use the brush

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.279 
direct everything back and use the brush
to<00:01:47.119> smooth<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.110> any

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
to smooth it out so you don't see any

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.960 
to smooth it out so you don't see any
traces<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> backcombing<00:01:51.020> into<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> hair

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
traces of the backcombing into the hair

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.279 
traces of the backcombing into the hair
you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> set<00:01:54.300> where<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.110> you

you have it set where you want it you

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.590 
you have it set where you want it you
can<00:01:55.440> use<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.679> finishing<00:01:56.130> spray<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> work

can use a finishing spray I like to work
with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> finishing<00:01:58.380> spray<00:01:58.649> last<00:01:59.039> when<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
with the finishing spray last when I

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.910 
with the finishing spray last when I
know<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.179> that's<00:02:00.750> exactly<00:02:01.380> where<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> want

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
know that that's exactly where I want

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.229 
know that that's exactly where I want
the<00:02:02.039> hair<00:02:02.250> children<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.429> you<00:02:05.550> can<00:02:05.759> use<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
the hair children and if you can use the

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.419 
the hair children and if you can use the
back<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.690> your<00:02:06.810> comb<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.800> any<00:02:08.039> little

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
back of your comb if you have any little

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.210 
back of your comb if you have any little
flyaways<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> smooth<00:02:10.140> down

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
flyaways that you need to smooth down

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.250 
flyaways that you need to smooth down
those<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.489> detail<00:02:11.910> work<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.629> camera

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
those are more detail work for on camera

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.040 
those are more detail work for on camera
and<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.129> laying<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.730> we've<00:02:15.270> just<00:02:15.300> set

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and just laying that we've just set

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.690 
and just laying that we've just set
there<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:16.739> she<00:02:16.890> looks<00:02:17.069> great<00:02:17.459> will

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
there and I think she looks great will

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.430 
there and I think she looks great will
do<00:02:17.849> some<00:02:18.060> final<00:02:18.300> touch-ups<00:02:18.690> when<00:02:19.170> she's<00:02:19.410> in

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
do some final touch-ups when she's in

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
front of evening dress but she looks

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.020 
front of evening dress but she looks
beautiful
