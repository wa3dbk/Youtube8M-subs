 4.2.1 for the galaxy s3 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.840

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.430
 terminal on the panel itself 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.430
 notifications 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.890
 other news would be 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.020
 the s voice that is the same as galaxy s 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.909

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.289
 remember that it is a non-version 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.450
 officer of a village and the people who 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.729
 still have a guarantee they should not 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.460
 update should wait for the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 final version since cash 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.170

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 is this flashed as an officer 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 is this rom does not have move no 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.200
