00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello on this occasion we will review 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.170
 this application that is called after focus 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.900
 this application will help us to give you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 a professional touch to photos with which they are 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 taken with not so professional cameras 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 I do not know if you have seen any 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.340
 occasion photos in which the background looks 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 quite out of focus and how it is given 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 more detail to what you have in front 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 this application will help us to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.150
 do this let's see an example I'll 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.399
 select a photo that takes me like this 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 mediator quickly and here we have it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.920
 once we open it, it tells us that what 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 method we prefer to use if the smart 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 or the manual in the smart we're going to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 let the application just the like that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.920
 detect the contours and do all the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 I work almost she will leave it in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 smart this time and we're going to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 give you continue here is teaching us 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.140
 to do all that but we 're going to skip it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.649
 because I 'm going to explain 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.470
 as we see here is the interface this is 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.360
 the picture this is back undo this 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.270
 Well this one if I do not know what the truth is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 and here we have focus focus you can 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.320
 focus and let's choose what we want 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.010
 focus on this occasion is going to be this 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 now 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.560
 bg is background or background and we are going to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.050
 select what we want it to be in 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 the background that would be this and this 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.090
 there it is and this is medium if we want 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.160
 something does not come out so out of focus but in 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.480
 this occasion to be noticed more I'm going to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.390
 Give only focus and background as 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.940
 we see now that you see clearly 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.940
 the computer is on this side that is 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.990
 it looks just as focused as my face and I 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
 I want it to look a little more 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.770
 professional so now we are going to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.409
 put the following 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.070
 and let's see what it is that gives us 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.070
 result 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.619
 We wait a few moments and ready as you see 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.689
 Now that focused totally good 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.880
 not totally but it defocused quite 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.340
 the background and it adds a little more 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.400
 professional to the photo still has 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.099
 filters and all these things I hope that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 yes they serve in this brush emulator as 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.420
 I'm the human in an emulator sometimes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 the emulators are locked but we are going to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.160
 see I'm going to try to apply a filter 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.800
 there is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.900
 here you have more filters and we can 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.080
 modify still as if it were a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.840
 real camera modify the opening what 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.470
 type of lens aperture increase or 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.480
 decrease the background blur and how 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.450
 we see this application is very good for 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.129
 give a few touches a little more 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.560
 professionals to the images there are some 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.420
 applications that let you blur 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.030
 but let's say that if you select a 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.010
 circle here even though this is in the background 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.450
 that's going to stay focused and this but 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.390
 this application is pretty smart 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.810
 to detect the contours and help us 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.840
 to have this kind of opening effect 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.940
 of the lens of the cameras then this 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.730
 it would be the application and we can already 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.730
 share from here to facebook or where 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.360
 we want or just keep it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.940
 here we keep it 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.520
 and ready as you see this application is very 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.100
 good and it's also free in the google 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.290
 play store as always I bringing the 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.050
 Free applications for you 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.840
 use them very happy if you liked this
