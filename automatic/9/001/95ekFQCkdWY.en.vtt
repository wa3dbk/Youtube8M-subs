a long time you know power the rough cut

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.770 
a long time you know power the rough cut
is<00:02:49.690> rated<00:02:50.690> pressure<00:02:50.959> plates<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.420> that's<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
is rated pressure plates and that's it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.569 
is rated pressure plates and that's it

any block on the dirt you know so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.820 
any block on the dirt you know so
redstone<00:03:35.450> torch<00:03:35.630> their<00:03:35.840> contents<00:03:36.560> will<00:03:36.680> see

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
redstone torch their contents will see

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.059 
redstone torch their contents will see
their<00:03:36.980> forces<00:03:37.400> are<00:03:37.550> here<00:03:37.820> yes<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.710> this

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
their forces are here yes that that this

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.870 
their forces are here yes that that this
that

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
that

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.280

then humming it up that's it I'm gonna
use<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.560> block<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.970> match<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.300> doorframe<00:03:52.750> I

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
use this block so match the doorframe I

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.740 
use this block so match the doorframe I
guess<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.590> what<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.430> wooden<00:03:54.730> house<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.630> know

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
maybe it's a fun time a way to make it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.230 
maybe it's a fun time a way to make it
into<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.040> double<00:04:27.310> or<00:04:27.460> because<00:04:27.940> we're<00:04:28.090> people

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
into a double or because we're people

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.040 
into a double or because we're people
have<00:04:28.510> iron<00:04:29.260> doors<00:04:29.440> they<00:04:29.680> usually<00:04:30.430> do<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:31.050> you

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
have iron doors they usually do this you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.730 
have iron doors they usually do this you
know<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:37.110> personally<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.380> think<00:04:38.500> this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
know that but personally I think this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.560 
know that but personally I think this
would<00:04:38.920> be<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:39.550> better<00:04:39.910> first<00:04:40.300> if<00:04:40.450> I'm

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
would be you know better first if I'm

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.800 
would be you know better first if I'm

serious those you know like that and

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.660 
serious those you know like that and
close<00:04:43.950> zombies<00:04:44.950> can't<00:04:45.190> get<00:04:45.310> through<00:04:45.430> that

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
close zombies can't get through that
