solve<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.639> picked<00:00:08.970> up<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.300> few<00:00:09.480> minutes<00:00:09.660> ago

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
solve that I picked up a few minutes ago

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.650 
solve that I picked up a few minutes ago
bought<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.450> van<00:00:12.450> saw<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:14.120> originally<00:00:15.120> picked<00:00:15.420> up

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
bought a van saw I originally picked up

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.050 
bought a van saw I originally picked up
I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.230> was<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> 15-inch<00:00:17.160> saw<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.820> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
I think it was a 15-inch saw and I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.529 
I think it was a 15-inch saw and I
didn't<00:00:18.510> like<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.470> took<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.859> back

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
didn't like it at all so I took you back

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.970 
didn't like it at all so I took you back
this<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> 21<00:00:22.830> inch<00:00:23.039> saw<00:00:23.570> I

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
this one I think is a 21 inch saw I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
this one I think is a 21 inch saw I
think<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:26.910> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.269> light<00:00:27.869> aluminum

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
think it's some kind of light aluminum

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
think it's some kind of light aluminum
but<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.910> far<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.390> been<00:00:30.449> pretty<00:00:30.660> durable<00:00:32.690> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
but so far it's been pretty durable it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
but so far it's been pretty durable it
can<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:35.180> cumbersome<00:00:37.160> putting<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
can be a little cumbersome putting it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
can be a little cumbersome putting it
together<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.730> trouble<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.390> putting<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
together but the trouble of putting it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.639 
together but the trouble of putting it
together<00:00:43.670> once<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> together

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
together once you get it together

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.389 
together once you get it together
working<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:48.230> great<00:00:49.230> song<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:53.219> has

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
working this this is a great song it has

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.020 
working this this is a great song it has
a<00:00:53.600> little<00:00:54.600> wing<00:00:54.870> nut<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> bottom<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.760> keeps

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
a little wing nut on the bottom it keeps

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:08.050 
a little wing nut on the bottom it keeps
it<00:00:57.270> all<00:00:57.449> compact<00:00:58.379> together

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.970 

sometimes<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.110> been<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.710> bit

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
sometimes it has been a little bit

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.740 
sometimes it has been a little bit
stubborn<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.940> together<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> had

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
stubborn to get together we kind of had

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
stubborn to get together we kind of had
to<00:01:15.930> work<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.380> together<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:17.340> time<00:01:23.540> get

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to work it together at the same time get

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.650 
to work it together at the same time get
it<00:01:24.690> seated<00:01:25.260> all<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:29.090> need<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> take<00:01:30.510> the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
it seated all the way need and take the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:41.090 
it seated all the way need and take the
wingnut

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.290 

and<00:01:42.100> just<00:01:42.400> tighten<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.850> down<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:45.060> usually<00:01:46.060> try

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
and just tighten it down I usually try

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.990 
and just tighten it down I usually try
to<00:01:46.330> turn<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:47.020> where<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.470> blade<00:01:47.770> will<00:01:48.130> go

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
to turn this where the blade will go

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.500 
to turn this where the blade will go
down<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.660> little<00:01:49.930> slot<00:01:51.030> I've<00:01:52.030> been<00:01:52.300> out

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
call it a an office a crosscut blade or

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.570 
call it a an office a crosscut blade or
one<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.930> would<00:02:05.050> get<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.260> normal<00:02:05.590> wood<00:02:06.070> cutting

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
one you would get a normal wood cutting

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.109 
one you would get a normal wood cutting
like<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.910> pruning<00:02:07.450> blade<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:09.729> it's

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
like a pruning blade but it's it's

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.210 
like a pruning blade but it's it's
fairly<00:02:10.450> big<00:02:10.810> once<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.260> put<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.560> together<00:02:11.680> but

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
fairly big once you put it together but

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.800 
fairly big once you put it together but
it's<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.270> what<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.780> about

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
it's like and that's what I like about

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's like and that's what I like about
it<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.760> teeth<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.300> very<00:02:16.330> sharp

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.340 

and<00:02:34.880> compared<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.720> size<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.880> how<00:02:38.720> well<00:02:39.080> it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
and compared to the size and how well it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:51.160 
and compared to the size and how well it
cuts<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:43.640> worth<00:02:44.000> its<00:02:44.270> weight<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.960> can

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
cuts it's worth its weight as you can

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.460 
cuts it's worth its weight as you can
tell<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.710> solid<00:02:56.590> solid<00:02:57.590> wood

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
tell this is this is solid solid wood

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:25.220 
tell this is this is solid solid wood
this<00:03:00.470> isn't<00:03:00.860> anything<00:03:01.070> that's<00:03:02.410> real<00:03:03.410> easy

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930 

and<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.350> can<00:03:26.590> tell<00:03:26.830> I'm<00:03:27.070> not<00:03:27.100> really

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
and you can tell I'm not really

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.380 
and you can tell I'm not really
we're<00:03:28.510> not<00:03:28.600> hardly<00:03:28.930> breathing<00:03:29.380> hard<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.740> all

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
we're not hardly breathing hard at all

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.500 
we're not hardly breathing hard at all
so<00:03:31.390> this<00:03:31.510> thing<00:03:31.750> cuts<00:03:32.110> really<00:03:32.500> fast<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
so this thing cuts really fast and it

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.810 
so this thing cuts really fast and it
won't<00:03:34.720> kill<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.230> while<00:03:35.440> you're<00:03:35.650> doing<00:03:35.920> it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
won't kill you while you're doing it

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.980 
won't kill you while you're doing it
think<00:03:37.360> about<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.230> at<00:03:38.320> REI<00:03:40.320> might<00:03:41.320> have<00:03:41.440> been<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
think about it at REI might have been I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.720 
think about it at REI might have been I
wasn't<00:03:43.990> much<00:03:44.110> 23<00:03:44.740> bucks<00:03:44.950> something<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.490> that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
wasn't much 23 bucks something like that

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.220

but that's one of those $20 items that

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.740 
but that's one of those $20 items that
has<00:03:50.500> been<00:03:50.770> well<00:03:51.070> worth<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:52.300> if<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> guys<00:03:52.690> are
