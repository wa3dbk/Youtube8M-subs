00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
there that's pretty important means the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
are actually pretty durable that's kind

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
are actually pretty durable that's kind
of<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> big<00:00:42.840> deal<00:00:42.989> nowadays<00:00:43.500> cuz<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
of a big deal nowadays cuz if you if you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.979 
of a big deal nowadays cuz if you if you
get<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> pair<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> headphones<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.629> comes<00:00:45.870> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
get a pair of headphones that comes in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.119 
get a pair of headphones that comes in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
really durable packaging it means

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
really durable packaging it means
they're<00:00:47.219> probably<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.760> durable<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
they're probably not that durable so I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
they're probably not that durable so I
would<00:00:49.770> definitely<00:00:50.190> recommend<00:00:50.309> something

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
would definitely recommend something

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
flight or whatnot so I will definitely

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
flight or whatnot so I will definitely
do<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> review<00:01:40.470> later<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.070> let<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.820> how

do a review later and let you know how

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
do a review later and let you know how
all<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> works<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.350> seems<00:01:43.740> like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
all this works but for now it seems like

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.760 
all this works but for now it seems like

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.720 
the iPad and Android but those aren't
very<00:03:29.000> good<00:03:29.180> because<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.799> lose<00:03:31.190> your

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
very good because if you lose your

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.490 
very good because if you lose your
electronics<00:03:32.359> or<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:32.959> forget<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.320> bring<00:03:33.410> it

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
electronics or you forget to bring it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.720 
electronics or you forget to bring it
one<00:03:33.650> day<00:03:33.829> then<00:03:34.040> you're<00:03:34.160> screwed<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:34.549> you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
one day then you're screwed because you

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.160 
one day then you're screwed because you
don't<00:03:34.850> know<00:03:34.910> how<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.269> manually<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
don't know how to do it manually so

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.870 
don't know how to do it manually so
always<00:03:36.350> having<00:03:36.590> these<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.130> airplane<00:03:37.549> if

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
always having these in the airplane if

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.880 
always having these in the airplane if
you<00:03:37.910> own<00:03:38.150> one<00:03:38.180> or<00:03:38.600> always<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.290> your<00:03:39.470> flight<00:03:39.709> bag

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
you own one or always on your flight bag

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.130 
you own one or always on your flight bag
or<00:03:40.070> whatnot<00:03:40.570> it'll<00:03:41.570> ensure<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.019> you'll

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
or whatnot it'll ensure that you'll

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.569 
or whatnot it'll ensure that you'll
always<00:03:42.320> be<00:03:42.410> able<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.709> get<00:03:42.920> somewhere<00:03:43.190> even<00:03:43.519> if

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
always be able to get somewhere even if

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.710 
always be able to get somewhere even if
you<00:03:43.640> don't<00:03:43.820> have<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.030> certain<00:03:44.450> piece<00:03:44.600> of

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
you don't have that certain piece of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.610 
you don't have that certain piece of
electronics<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:46.280> another<00:03:46.790> one<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
electronics and another one is this the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.130 
electronics and another one is this the
CPR<00:03:49.100> LX<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.209> probably<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.660> same<00:03:50.780> thing<00:03:51.019> I'm

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
CPR LX and probably the same thing I'm

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.660 
CPR LX and probably the same thing I'm
sure<00:03:51.290> they<00:03:51.380> have<00:03:51.500> an<00:03:51.620> app<00:03:51.709> for<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.100> but<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
sure they have an app for it but and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.920 
sure they have an app for it but and
that's<00:03:52.850> great<00:03:53.060> go<00:03:53.239> ahead<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.600> get<00:03:53.690> out<00:03:53.810> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that's great go ahead and get out and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.180 
that's great go ahead and get out and
use<00:03:54.109> it<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.470> make<00:03:54.620> sure<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.829> know<00:03:54.920> how<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.100> do

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
use it but make sure you know how to do

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.530 
use it but make sure you know how to do
it<00:03:55.310> manually<00:03:55.640> before<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.269> start<00:03:56.329> doing

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
it manually before you just start doing

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.390 
it manually before you just start doing
electronic<00:03:57.170> one<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.950> way<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.190> actually

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
electronic one that way you actually

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.099 
electronic one that way you actually
know<00:03:58.670> what<00:03:58.819> you're<00:03:58.940> looking<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.480> what<00:03:59.750> points

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
know what you're looking for what points

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.319 
know what you're looking for what points
you<00:04:00.170> need<00:04:00.260> hit<00:04:00.500> things<00:04:00.709> like<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.700> that's

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
you need hit things like that so that's

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.199 
you need hit things like that so that's
