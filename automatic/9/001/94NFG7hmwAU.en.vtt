00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 with the account of my garage and files 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.889
 Well in this case this one that I'm 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 waiting for a new car that arrives 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.320
 what good has to come just 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.910
 here have long placed but it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.380
 he knew that some tributes are missing but not 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
 before it arrives come if you are already 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
 here on the mobile I will teach better 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 said the car which offered in this 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 video which is one of the cars that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 more has given to talk about before that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.300
 be the dlc of the car that good that I 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 I would say that the most talked people because it is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.309
 a pretty strange car and it's the coi 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.980
 prowler here you have it cost 715 thousand 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.200
 dollars a pretty bitch pasture and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 considerable so I guess it will be 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 pretty cool the car to repeat very 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 good looking, always looking at him 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.640
 here is that to overcome an uncle is like 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.860
 front very fat because it is more finite 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 that if the big wheel 1 set I see it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.250
 as quite pretty fast or by 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 Inside look behind and pretty coach 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 and this is how I do not know how to say one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.399
 sports armored car I see it like that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.960
 the truth seems like a future knife and I 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.640
 I think it's the car that was most made 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.650
 better car the future of the fair but 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 well what I said already bought me 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 supposes that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.380
 should appear there is here you have it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.939
 lol lol confirmed this is the car that 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.970
 more resembles a damn car 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.240
 click future uncle has this 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.799
 look at the equipment for uncle is the whip 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.030
 that is, it is incredible 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.759
 good guy more likely a little bit to see 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.080
 how about mola much much much much not 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.180
 sits something handsome moustaki said 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.110
 how 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.110
 have health 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.530
 and here you have it 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.440
 I'm really cool very much and super weird 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.030
 it's like a normal car but in height and 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.180
 apart from a normal car but not normal 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.180
 because super weird weird really weird 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.040
 runs the mini gm in one of the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.110
 previous the car wanted me to be in 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.780
 the car which is in the middle of what 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.270
 that comes I would say that as evolution 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.590
 between a normal car and a monster behind 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.150
 it's not a car that is about half 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 that does not end up being monster truck and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.540
 that does not end up being a normal car but 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.940
 that is there in between is half a car 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.110
 normal half monster truck second then 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.450
 here you have it as an all-rounder 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.280
 advanced we could say it is gorgeous 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 honestly I love it is to say that the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.480
 aesthetic so far I would say that 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.670
 one of the cars that I like the most 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.670
 all that is the cane 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.410
 the back with a little more and I do not know 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.770
 if it will have some kind of cushioning 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.110
 something weird they do not have flat and weird 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.990
 here you have love many are 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.600
 very very cool and I do not get tired of saying it 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.320
 seen as well 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.010
 it is understood good when what happens 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.420
 before then here you have it very cool 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010
 true to cost what it costs 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.230
 I recommend that you buy it and if you have spare 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.990
 money but neither that is a car 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.490
 White mola do not know if you buy it because 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.460
 this work is very cool uncle and for the 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.020
 street with this is very cool and you can already 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.340
 we will see to see what kind of care has 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.110
 which is also divided in raising it in 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.120
 logical tutorial the subject assigns tico 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.190
 then here I decide with this super 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.630
 new car I liked it a lot and I 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.250
 I was quite surprised by the aesthetics 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.900
 a little more normal but do not be 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 it's strictly enough 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.550
 abnormal weird and strange and at the same time 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.900
 I do not know how to explain it good boy 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.370
 from what is said here I say goodbye to surprise 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.320
 the favorites and liked it if I got 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.300
 twitter and by instagram said it's worth it 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.200
 it has under the description what the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.200
 pancho palante seem 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.990
 leave this this new car 6 I behaved 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.650
 Tripoli description work and nothing in 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.650
