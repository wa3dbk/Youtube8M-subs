00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
higher in pitch okay so conversely to my

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.200 
higher in pitch okay so conversely to my
left

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.770

okay so I'm going down here pitch okay
so<00:01:18.290> that's<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.590> quick<00:01:18.799> orientation<00:01:19.040> as<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.180> up

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
so that's a quick orientation as to up

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.430 
so that's a quick orientation as to up
and<00:01:20.810> down<00:01:21.439> on<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> piano<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:24.110> other<00:01:24.229> thing

keys you're gonna notice that there are

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.120 
keys you're gonna notice that there are
patterns<00:01:33.260> of<00:01:33.530> two<00:01:34.250> keys<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.299> then<00:01:36.130> three

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
patterns of two keys and then three

patterns of two keys and then three
Black<00:01:37.370> Keys<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.909> then<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.150> pattern<00:01:38.360> repeats

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
Black Keys and then the pattern repeats

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.360 
Black Keys and then the pattern repeats
itself<00:01:43.479> down<00:01:44.479> as<00:01:44.630> well<00:01:44.810> okay<00:01:45.409> same<00:01:45.979> patterns

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
itself down as well okay same patterns

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.469 
itself down as well okay same patterns
now<00:01:47.110> every<00:01:48.110> single<00:01:48.470> note<00:01:48.710> has<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.159> name<00:01:49.549> now

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
now every single note has a name now

there are 88 keys but fortunately we

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.000 
there are 88 keys but fortunately we
don't<00:01:52.640> have<00:01:52.760> 88<00:01:53.180> names<00:01:53.540> for<00:01:53.810> these<00:01:53.930> notes<00:01:54.500> we

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
don't have 88 names for these notes we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.890 
don't have 88 names for these notes we
all<00:01:55.159> actually<00:01:55.580> only<00:01:55.760> use<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.119> first<00:01:56.299> seven

the piano is gonna be very important the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.270 
the piano is gonna be very important the
orientation<00:03:50.349> going<00:03:50.560> up<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:51.010> going<00:03:51.190> to

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
orientation going up is going to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.339 
orientation going up is going to
correspond<00:03:51.790> with<00:03:51.910> orientation<00:03:52.660> on<00:03:52.959> our<00:03:53.110> music

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
correspond with orientation on our music

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.030 
correspond with orientation on our music
as<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.299> higher<00:03:55.720> in<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.200> music<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.799> notes

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
as we go higher in the music the notes

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.619 
as we go higher in the music the notes
or<00:03:57.670> getting<00:03:58.209> high<00:03:58.599> as<00:03:58.870> we<00:03:59.739> go<00:03:59.950> down<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:01.450> the

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
or getting high as we go down in the

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.420 
or getting high as we go down in the
music<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.560> notes<00:04:02.799> are<00:04:03.040> gonna<00:04:03.159> get

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
music the notes are gonna get

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.869 
music the notes are gonna get
correspondingly<00:04:04.120> lower<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> left<00:04:06.489> okay

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
correspondingly lower to the left okay

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.350 
correspondingly lower to the left okay
so<00:04:07.629> this<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.590> moving<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.010> right<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:10.299> is

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
so this is moving to the right this is

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.740 
so this is moving to the right this is
moving<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.959> left<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:11.769> up<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:13.450> is

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
moving to the left this is up this is

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.129 
moving to the left this is up this is
down<00:04:14.730> okay<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:16.419> that's<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.690> quick<00:04:16.900> orientation

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
down okay so that's a quick orientation

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.219 
down okay so that's a quick orientation
a<00:04:17.979> little<00:04:18.519> primer<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.940> get<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.209> ready<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.750> read
