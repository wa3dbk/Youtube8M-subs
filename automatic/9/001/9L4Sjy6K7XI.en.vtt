00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because I mean from what he showed later

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
because I mean from what he showed later
on<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> power<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> kill<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that's very unclear hopefully we'll get

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.710 
that's very unclear hopefully we'll get
an<00:01:19.590> answer<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> next<00:01:20.490> episode<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.479> of

let<00:02:11.520> his<00:02:11.640> wife<00:02:11.760> Lynn

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
let his wife Lynn

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.030 
let his wife Lynn
because<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:12.960> doesn't<00:02:13.140> want<00:02:13.290> her<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> die<00:02:13.770> but

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
because he doesn't want her to die but

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.770 
because he doesn't want her to die but
then<00:02:14.070> he<00:02:14.310> remembers<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> dead<00:02:15.180> bodies<00:02:15.630> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
then he remembers the dead bodies that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.230 
then he remembers the dead bodies that
he<00:02:15.960> saw<00:02:16.170> hanging<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.280> okay<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:17.880> want<00:02:18.180> to

he saw hanging like okay I don't want to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.170 
he saw hanging like okay I don't want to
end<00:02:18.390> up<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.230> he<00:02:19.580> accidentally<00:02:20.580> gets

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
end up like that so he accidentally gets

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.810 
end up like that so he accidentally gets
a<00:02:21.330> higher<00:02:21.630> or<00:02:21.990> lower<00:02:22.020> score<00:02:22.740> than<00:02:22.770> her<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.700> he

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
a higher or lower score than her so he

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.630 
a higher or lower score than her so he
can<00:02:24.000> win<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.840> she<00:02:25.380> drops<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.070> pregnancy

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
can win and then she drops the pregnancy

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.150 
can win and then she drops the pregnancy
bombs<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.120> okay<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.720> long<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.440> don't<00:02:28.680> get

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.800 
so um did she just say that sweetie be
sent<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.459> heaven<00:03:44.760> because<00:03:44.880> she<00:03:45.330> seemed<00:03:45.630> to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
sent to heaven because she seemed to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.630 
sent to heaven because she seemed to
have<00:03:45.930> realized<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.800> truth<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.459> game

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
have realized the truth about the game

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.670 
have realized the truth about the game
before<00:03:47.940> he<00:03:48.120> did<00:03:48.420> because<00:03:48.810> he<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.440> over

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
before he did because he was just over

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.440 
before he did because he was just over
there<00:03:49.800> snotting<00:03:50.580> drooling<00:03:51.060> he<00:03:51.240> was<00:03:51.360> just

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
there snotting drooling he was just

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.870 
there snotting drooling he was just
going<00:03:51.720> insane<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.500> she<00:03:52.830> was<00:03:53.010> only<00:03:53.040> 1<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.640> her

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
going insane and she was only 1 in her

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.110 
going insane and she was only 1 in her
right<00:03:54.090> mind<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.010> how<00:03:56.010> could<00:03:56.250> she<00:03:56.310> win<00:03:56.820> because

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
right mind so how could she win because

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.480 
right mind so how could she win because
she<00:03:57.420> did<00:03:57.630> win<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:57.959> actual<00:03:58.620> game<00:03:58.650> technically

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
she did win the actual game technically

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.720 
she did win the actual game technically
so<00:03:59.970> how<00:04:00.180> did<00:04:00.240> he<00:04:01.080> get<00:04:01.320> reincarnated<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.340> she

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
so how did he get reincarnated and she

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.090 
so how did he get reincarnated and she
gets<00:04:02.970> into<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.330> void<00:04:03.510> how<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:04.110> she<00:04:04.140> win<00:04:04.650> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
gets into the void how can she win and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.270 
gets into the void how can she win and
still<00:04:05.940> get<00:04:06.240> sent<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.810> hell<00:04:06.990> basically<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.740> my

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
still get sent to hell basically in my

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.449 
still get sent to hell basically in my
opinion<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.150> games<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:10.200> nothing<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.010> do<00:04:11.190> two

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
opinion the games have nothing to do two

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.760 
opinion the games have nothing to do two
