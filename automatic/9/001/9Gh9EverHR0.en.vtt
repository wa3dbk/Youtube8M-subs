00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.140 

that<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.320> don't<00:01:12.530> mangle<00:01:13.070> up<00:01:13.190> those<00:01:13.610> there<00:01:14.060> are

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
that you don't mangle up those there are

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.080 
that you don't mangle up those there are
four<00:01:14.450> lines<00:01:14.660> here<00:01:15.100> don't<00:01:16.100> break<00:01:16.490> those<00:01:16.730> things

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
four lines here don't break those things

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.520 
four lines here don't break those things
it's<00:01:17.720> expensive<00:01:18.230> on<00:01:18.800> those<00:01:18.950> two<00:01:19.370> centers

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
it's expensive on those two centers

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.200 
it's expensive on those two centers
burgers<00:01:21.530> that's<00:01:22.250> why<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.430> always<00:01:22.640> say<00:01:22.760> give<00:01:23.180> me

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210

my phone and you see I'm not trying

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.590 
my phone and you see I'm not trying
anything<00:01:30.770> down<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.430> just<00:01:31.700> take<00:01:32.030> everything<00:01:32.300> on

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
anything down I just take everything on

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.260 
anything down I just take everything on
and<00:01:33.470> later<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.980> put<00:01:34.430> everything<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:37.270> don't

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
and later on put everything on don't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.430 
and later on put everything on don't
forget<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.630> put<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.960> gas<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:41.440> make

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
forget to put the gas to see that make

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.780 
forget to put the gas to see that make
sure<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:42.980> all<00:01:43.100> two<00:01:43.340> sensors<00:01:43.790> on<00:01:45.790> fire

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
sure that you all two sensors on fire

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.930 
sure that you all two sensors on fire
this<00:01:47.000> one<00:01:47.180> up

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.990 

and<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.020> followed<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> line<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:58.490> o2

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and I just followed the line on o2

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.290 
and I just followed the line on o2
sensor<00:01:59.860> just<00:02:00.860> followed<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.310> line<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:02.270> I

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
sensor just followed the line and what I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.530 
sensor just followed the line and what I
did<00:02:02.630> was<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.940> disconnected<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.090> all<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> way

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
did was I disconnected it all the way

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.950 
did was I disconnected it all the way
over<00:02:05.930> on<00:02:06.970> electrical<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> can

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
over on electrical so that I can

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.950 
over on electrical so that I can
straighten<00:02:09.440> out<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.890> line<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:11.390> reason<00:02:11.780> for

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
straighten out the line the reason for

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.240 
straighten out the line the reason for
that<00:02:12.020> was<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:14.510> don't<00:02:14.890> break<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> line

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that was that you don't break the line

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:37.010 
that was that you don't break the line
is<00:02:17.060> slanted<00:02:17.330> back

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:52.860 

but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:08.280 

oh<00:02:52.930> no<00:02:53.680> way<00:02:53.830> why

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.140 

from<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> morning

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.550 

beautiful<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.290> 2<00:03:17.680> into<00:03:18.680> 1

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.120 

then<00:03:22.190> into<00:03:22.790> two
