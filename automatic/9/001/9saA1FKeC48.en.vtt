one now I kind of went back on forth on

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
one now I kind of went back on forth on
whether<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.880> wanted<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> consider<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
whether I wanted to consider this a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
whether I wanted to consider this a
glitch<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.250> hard<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.699> into

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
glitch because it is hard to get into

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.820 
glitch because it is hard to get into
you<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.359> need<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> strafe<00:00:19.170> jump<00:00:19.529> which<00:00:19.800> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you do need to do a strafe jump which is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
you do need to do a strafe jump which is
technically<00:00:20.460> considered<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.970> glitch<00:00:21.180> but

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
technically considered a glitch but

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
technically considered a glitch but
since<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.380> there<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:23.279> an

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
since it can get up there with an

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849 
since it can get up there with an
exosuit<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.840> decided<00:00:25.109> against<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
exosuit I kind of decided against it and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.290 
exosuit I kind of decided against it and
just<00:00:26.010> decide<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> call<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> secret<00:00:27.000> straight

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
just decide to call the secret straight

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
just decide to call the secret straight
jump<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:27.660> still<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.500> cool<00:00:28.710> really

jump over it and get it perfectly and if
you<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.720> look<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.140> like

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you do it right it should look just like

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800

this now here we are in the secret spot

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
this now here we are in the secret spot
unfortunately<00:01:16.590> zombies<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.189> still<00:01:17.460> climb<00:01:17.700> up

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
unfortunately zombies can still climb up

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
unfortunately zombies can still climb up
because<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> technically<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> part<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> the
