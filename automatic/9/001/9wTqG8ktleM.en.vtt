times<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.570> them<00:02:20.780> broken<00:02:21.080> down<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
times to really get them broken down a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.120 
times to really get them broken down a
Vitamix<00:02:22.880> will<00:02:23.209> rip<00:02:24.200> through<00:02:24.440> these<00:02:24.620> greens

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
Vitamix will rip through these greens

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.820 
Vitamix will rip through these greens
and<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.760> will<00:02:25.970> crush<00:02:26.540> every<00:02:26.959> cell<00:02:27.260> wall<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.740> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and it will crush every cell wall and it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.430 
and it will crush every cell wall and it
release<00:02:28.220> everything<00:02:28.910> good<00:02:29.240> about<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.750> within

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
release everything good about it within

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.220 
release everything good about it within
a<00:02:30.500> couple<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.890> seconds<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.180> start<00:02:33.020> out

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
a couple of seconds so you start out

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.460 
a couple of seconds so you start out
with<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.360> can<00:02:35.360> start<00:02:35.570> out<00:02:35.720> with<00:02:35.930> one<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.410> two

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
with you can start out with one or two

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770 
with you can start out with one or two
cups<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.920> water<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.430> water<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.940> depending<00:02:38.510> on

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
cups of water the water is depending on

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.350 
cups of water the water is depending on
how<00:02:39.350> thick<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.610> smoothie<00:02:41.150> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
how thick you like your smoothie you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.270 
how thick you like your smoothie you
might<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.840> runny<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.800> might<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:43.250> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
might like it runny you might like it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.660 
might like it runny you might like it
thick<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.360> I'll<00:02:44.540> just<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.900> two<00:02:45.110> cups<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.720> then

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
thick so I'll just do two cups and then

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.210 
thick so I'll just do two cups and then
as<00:02:49.670> far<00:02:49.910> as<00:02:50.060> celery<00:02:50.450> goes<00:02:50.750> as<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.530> see<00:02:51.800> if

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
as far as celery goes as you can see if

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
as far as celery goes as you can see if
the<00:02:52.520> recipe<00:02:52.970> says<00:02:53.180> three<00:02:53.630> stalks<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.080> celery

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the recipe says three stalks of celery

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.960 
the recipe says three stalks of celery
well<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:55.130> know<00:02:55.250> there's<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.610> really<00:02:55.820> big

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
well you know there's a really big

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.940 
well you know there's a really big
difference<00:02:56.120> here<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.170> if<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
difference here so if you're going to

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.680 
difference here so if you're going to
use<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.280> small<00:02:58.580> ones<00:02:58.940> if<00:02:59.180> that's<00:02:59.360> all<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690

have just like do three or four of these
two<00:03:02.300> equal<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:02.780> stalk<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.290> celery<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> like

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
two equal one stalk of celery so I like

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.110 
two equal one stalk of celery so I like
to<00:03:06.170> put<00:03:06.440> my<00:03:06.470> greens<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:07.010> first<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.610> really<00:03:07.910> get

to put my greens in first and really get

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.690 
to put my greens in first and really get
them<00:03:08.330> um<00:03:09.670> pulverized<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.370> two<00:03:16.370> cups<00:03:16.580> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
them um pulverized so it's two cups of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:31.320 
them um pulverized so it's two cups of
water<00:03:16.910> three<00:03:17.299> stalks<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.840> celery

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.730 

you<00:03:32.330> could<00:03:32.510> just<00:03:32.540> take<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.900> lid<00:03:33.140> off<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.590> for

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
you could just take the lid off but for

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.770 
you could just take the lid off but for
some<00:03:33.950> reason<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.460> just<00:03:34.490> always<00:03:34.880> take<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.360> whole

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
some reason I just always take the whole

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
some reason I just always take the whole
lid<00:03:35.990> off<00:03:37.270> ah<00:03:38.270> bananas<00:03:39.140> bananas<00:03:39.170> are<00:03:39.770> good

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
lid off ah bananas bananas are good

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.130 
lid off ah bananas bananas are good
fruit<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.430> start<00:03:40.730> with<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.300> will<00:03:41.720> give<00:03:42.020> you

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
fruit to start with it will give you

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.200 
fruit to start with it will give you
sweetness<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.010> will<00:03:43.310> like<00:03:43.520> your<00:03:43.670> smoothie

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
sweetness so you will like your smoothie

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.960 
sweetness so you will like your smoothie
because<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.630> lot<00:03:44.960> of<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.110> greens<00:03:45.440> are<00:03:45.650> bitter

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
because a lot of the greens are bitter

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.670 
because a lot of the greens are bitter
and<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.240> think<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.260> taste<00:03:48.530> that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
and I think it is just a taste that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.050 
and I think it is just a taste that
you're<00:03:48.830> going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.010> have<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.250> work<00:03:49.430> yourself<00:03:49.880> up

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
you're going to have to work yourself up

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.360 
you're going to have to work yourself up
to<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.600> personally<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.920> very<00:03:52.040> bitter

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
to I personally like the very bitter

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.910 
to I personally like the very bitter
greens<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:54.020> know<00:03:54.140> other<00:03:54.260> people<00:03:54.650> don't

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.370 
greens and you know other people don't
they<00:03:55.100> stick<00:03:55.370> with<00:03:55.670> spinach<00:03:56.150> because<00:03:56.780> it's

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
they stick with spinach because it's

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.880 
they stick with spinach because it's
kind<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.710> like<00:03:58.810> no<00:03:59.810> flavor<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.320> spinach<00:04:00.710> but

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
kind of like no flavor to spinach but

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.960 
kind of like no flavor to spinach but
you're<00:04:01.040> getting<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.310> benefits<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.850> the

done<00:04:28.040> now<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.000> could<00:04:29.360> let<00:04:29.510> just<00:04:29.720> keep<00:04:29.930> going

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
done now you could let just keep going

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.760 
done now you could let just keep going
on<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.590> would<00:04:30.710> get<00:04:30.860> very<00:04:30.890> froth<00:04:31.670> frothy<00:04:32.770> I
