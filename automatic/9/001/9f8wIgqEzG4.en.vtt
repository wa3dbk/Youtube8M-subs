00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.180
 but these would not be expected from my name 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.180
 that retired to the turn 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.900
 and none of that 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.240
 and the bearings 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.529
 the meeting was going well germany was giving 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.259
 I sent carriage I expressed runs 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.550
 German German if this does not know what the 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.960
 problem the hardware store that people 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.820
 engineer does not know what he wants to put in 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.910
 that problem people do not know what they want 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.500
 see a guy would have it right 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 the other day he tells me almost like pim 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 pam pum that touch the other tells me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 and he tells me by accident kutxa or by 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 chance will not have a nut anymore or 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.480
 less or paraguay 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.550
 by chance I do not have a pancake 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.550
 and a hardware store 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 by chance you find a kilo 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.460
 Mandarin down here 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.280
 but I say nothing to you if you listen to me 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.110
 listen to me tell me by chance not 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.659
 I'll have a nut and it's pretty much like that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.609
 I know that in a cafe they believe 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.399
 is of such caliber within sodium of 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.409
 manioc cluster has the look 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.210
 nut that is but I do not say anything and I 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.600
 I see and it's going to come back very soon 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600
 big 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.990
 I give more girl returns to the time very 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100
 girl 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.079
 but the biggest one comes back very long 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.670
 big and the question is why it brings us 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.830
 the screw but you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.030
 and that's it but not because people do not 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.470
 he knows what he wants to walk knows what 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.680
 I wanted the one I really did not want either 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.680
 walk 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.660
 and so and so with everything there is an old woman who 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.040
 come here listen there is an old woman who looks 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 I tell you with the silver the pdk cats or 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 woman here in 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.869
 and I then the baby hockey payment 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.869
 all high school 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.750
 luczak there is the old the other day here and I 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 says foxit glue n 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 I have rustman and germany does not have 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.509
 glue to xbox 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.310
 of how transparent one I tell you and 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.410
 there comes uncertainty in the client 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.550
 video because the customer comes to look 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.680
 dry fox glue 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.599
 I did not know there were several tastes 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.579
 and there I comply with the protocol of 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.790
 reassuring the client to nobody 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:26.549
 I know you know that you beat from the transparent 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.549
 because anything is transparent 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 I do not know why that but it was 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.819
 quiet people stayed older 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.939
 democracy 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.810
 he takes it takes him away he goes to see the 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:44.069
 while at the time that half an hour puts him - - - 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.909
 28 minutes 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.319
 here and again this glue does not stick the 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.209
 I removed the guanaca like again 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.159
 no this glue can not produce that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.280
 I stick a shelf against the wall the bathroom 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.280
 is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.340
 do not listen trascartÃ³n the champion me 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.709
 says since the glue does not hit you 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.270
 by chance you will not have a tender for 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.770
 that they are twisted 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.960
 listen to the phrase 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.260
 not by chance will have an author nor 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.820
 He cited that the eyes are twisted 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.820
 I say look 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.530
 be of the screw 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.160
 is to be enrobed 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 if it does not curl it's a nail 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.190
 thank you very much good
