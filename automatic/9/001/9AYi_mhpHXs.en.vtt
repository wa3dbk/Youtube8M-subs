00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.430 
fresh pasta looks pretty quick but the
idea<00:01:46.940> with<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:47.210> dish<00:01:47.480> is<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.690> we<00:01:47.900> want<00:01:48.410> to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
idea with this dish is that we want to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.050 
idea with this dish is that we want to
cook<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.770> spaghetti<00:01:48.920> more<00:01:49.580> in<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.820> sauce

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
cook the spaghetti more in the sauce

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.520 
cook the spaghetti more in the sauce
than<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.570> water<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> meantime<00:01:51.260> gonna

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
than in the water the meantime gonna

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.960 
than in the water the meantime gonna
take<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.680> little<00:01:51.890> bit<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.190> pasta<00:01:52.340> water<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
take a little bit of the pasta water and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.520 
take a little bit of the pasta water and
put<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.420> pan<00:01:53.570> with<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.840> sauce<00:01:54.140> by

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
put it in the pan with the sauce by

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.950 
put it in the pan with the sauce by
doing<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.340> helps<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.180> pasta<00:01:56.600> take<00:01:56.780> in

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
doing that it helps the pasta take in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.420 
doing that it helps the pasta take in
the<00:01:57.080> sauce<00:01:57.260> because<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.010> starch<00:01:58.280> in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the sauce because of all the starch in

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.790 
the sauce because of all the starch in
the<00:01:58.520> water<00:01:58.700> sort<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.180> like<00:01:59.330> forges<00:01:59.840> there<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
the water sort of like forges there the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.350 
the water sort of like forges there the
relationship<00:02:01.430> between<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.850> pasta<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
relationship between the pasta and the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.030 
relationship between the pasta and the
sauce<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.900> that's<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> goal<00:02:03.440> checking<00:02:03.920> what

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
sauce and that's the goal checking what

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.470 
sauce and that's the goal checking what
this<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.370> that<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.730> want<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.270> too<00:02:05.330> far

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
this is that I want that to go too far

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600 
this is that I want that to go too far
I'm<00:02:05.930> moving<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> pasta<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.220> water<00:02:07.460> is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
I'm moving the pasta so the water is

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.040 
I'm moving the pasta so the water is
able<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.910> get<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.119> between<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.869> whole

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
able to get in between and that whole

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.540 
able to get in between and that whole
cooking<00:02:09.320> thing<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.710> happening<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> good<00:02:10.399> way

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
cooking thing is happening in a good way

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.180 
cooking thing is happening in a good way
I'm<00:02:10.820> liking<00:02:11.150> what<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:16.010> whole<00:02:16.160> idea

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
I'm liking what that is the whole idea

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.190 
I'm liking what that is the whole idea
is<00:02:16.670> trying<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.330> find<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.690> perfect<00:02:17.900> balance

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
is trying to find that perfect balance

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.230 
is trying to find that perfect balance
between<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.740> pasta<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.520> condiment

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
between the pasta and the condiment

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.640 
between the pasta and the condiment
taking<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.020> big<00:02:21.170> flavor<00:02:21.440> from<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
taking all the big flavor from the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.410 
taking all the big flavor from the
tomato<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.250> bays<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> pepper<00:02:22.910> tuna<00:02:23.209> right

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
tomato the bays of the pepper tuna right

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.290 
tomato the bays of the pepper tuna right
and<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:24.230> becomes<00:02:24.650> one<00:02:25.580> thing<00:02:25.820> we're<00:02:26.150> using

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and it becomes one thing we're using

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.790 
and it becomes one thing we're using
fresh<00:02:26.660> pasta<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.200> going<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.380> cook<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.620> little

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
fresh pasta so is going to cook a little

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.470 
fresh pasta so is going to cook a little
bit<00:02:27.920> quicker<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.520> dry<00:02:28.760> pasta<00:02:29.000> like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
bit quicker if it was dry pasta like

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.510 
bit quicker if it was dry pasta like
most<00:02:29.720> boxer<00:02:30.380> packages<00:02:30.770> recommend<00:02:31.220> like<00:02:31.340> nine

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
most boxer packages recommend like nine

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.040 
most boxer packages recommend like nine
minutes<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.120> know<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.420> difference<00:02:32.780> in

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
minutes you know the difference in

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.440 
minutes you know the difference in
flavor<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.590> huge<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.820> how<00:02:34.940> it's<00:02:35.090> taking

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
flavor is huge you see how it's taking

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.810 
flavor is huge you see how it's taking
it<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.920> tightening<00:02:36.920> up

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
it in tightening up

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.010 
it in tightening up
and<00:02:38.820> go<00:02:38.970> through<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.240> same<00:02:39.480> process<00:02:39.540> again

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
and go through that same process again

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.990 
and go through that same process again
I'm<00:02:40.380> also<00:02:40.530> looking<00:02:40.890> at<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.430> color<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I'm also looking at the color and the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.880 
I'm also looking at the color and the
pasta<00:02:42.480> every<00:02:42.750> time<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.960> cook<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> down<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
pasta every time I cook it down and it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.950 
pasta every time I cook it down and it
gets<00:02:43.920> tighter<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.850> color<00:02:45.120> changes<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.660> touch

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
gets tighter the color changes a touch

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.960 
gets tighter the color changes a touch
this<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.680> taking<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.160> little<00:02:47.310> bit<00:02:47.550> more<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this is taking a little bit more that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.730 
this is taking a little bit more that
flavor<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.690> can't<00:02:48.930> help<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.170> notice<00:02:49.260> you've
