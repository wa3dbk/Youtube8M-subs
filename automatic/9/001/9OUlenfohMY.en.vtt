00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
panel which is not a surprise because we

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.210 
panel which is not a surprise because we
we<00:01:29.759> knew<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> myth<00:01:30.569> but<00:01:31.380> look<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.130> how

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
we knew it was a myth but look at how

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.309 
we knew it was a myth but look at how
the<00:01:32.280> backing<00:01:32.909> fabric<00:01:33.149> was<00:01:33.509> ripped<00:01:33.929> from<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
the backing fabric was ripped from the

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.600 
the backing fabric was ripped from the
deformation<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.069> we<00:01:35.250> saw<00:01:35.429> in<00:01:35.580> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
deformation that we saw in that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
deformation that we saw in that
slow-motion<00:01:36.360> video<00:01:36.569> there's<00:01:36.750> quite<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> big

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
slow-motion video there's quite a big

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
slow-motion video there's quite a big
dent<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:38.789> into<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.179> panel<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.840> can

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
dent that was put into this panel I can

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.590 
dent that was put into this panel I can
actually<00:01:40.530> fit<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.190> finger<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.149> hole<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
actually fit my finger in the hole that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
actually fit my finger in the hole that
was<00:01:42.780> left<00:01:43.140> after<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.770> pulled<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.159> bullet<00:01:44.340> out

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
was left after I pulled the bullet out

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
was left after I pulled the bullet out
you<00:01:44.819> can<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> fabric<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.319> torn<00:01:46.770> in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you can see that the fabric is torn in

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can see that the fabric is torn in
there<00:01:47.130> showing<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:47.909> there's<00:01:48.090> still<00:01:48.299> a

significant backside signature which is

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
significant backside signature which is
the<00:01:50.970> energy<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.390> still<00:01:51.840> gets<00:01:52.020> transferred

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the energy that still gets transferred

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
the energy that still gets transferred
through<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.950> body<00:01:53.160> armor<00:01:53.459> even<00:01:54.209> though<00:01:54.300> the
