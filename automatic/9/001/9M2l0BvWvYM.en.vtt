no<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:31.189> okay<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.369> before<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.900> cracking

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
no we go okay now before we get cracking

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
no we go okay now before we get cracking
with<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> color<00:01:34.650> Oh<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.400> fact<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.939> maybe

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
with the color Oh in fact actually maybe

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.249 
with the color Oh in fact actually maybe
we<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.420> add<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> color<00:01:36.810> first<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we should add the color first so it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
we should add the color first so it
doesn't<00:01:37.500> smudge<00:01:37.740> yes<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> bad<00:01:39.119> idea

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
doesn't smudge yes that's not a bad idea

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.490 
doesn't smudge yes that's not a bad idea
actually

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
actually

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
actually
because<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> smudge<00:01:42.360> would<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
because for this to smudge would be a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.249 
because for this to smudge would be a
disaster<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.820> ruin<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
disaster it would ruin it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.910 
disaster it would ruin it
so<00:01:46.860> yeah<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.030> been<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> lot<00:01:48.329> more

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
so yeah this would have been a lot more

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.960 
so yeah this would have been a lot more
what's<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> word<00:01:50.240> harder<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.700> color

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
what's the word harder if if this color

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
what's the word harder if if this color
was<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.360> fast<00:01:54.689> yes<00:01:55.259> sorry<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> color<00:01:55.920> was

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
was down fast yes sorry if the color was

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.800 
was down fast yes sorry if the color was
not<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.390> been<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.659> more

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
not down it would have been a lot more

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
not down it would have been a lot more
difficult<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.229> it'll<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.950> smudging

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
difficult because it'll be smudging

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
difficult because it'll be smudging
everywhere<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.210> looks<00:02:00.390> horrible

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
everywhere and that just looks horrible

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.319 
everywhere and that just looks horrible
