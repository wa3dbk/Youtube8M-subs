 [Music] 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 in this video I'll be 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.640
 sharing 5 proposals for 5 designs 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 of nails for this Christmas are very 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 easy to make 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 are some designs that you are going to be able to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.230
 do at home and I say that they are very easy 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.809
 to do because they are going to be using a pike 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 teeth and a pin and if you would like 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.990
 learn how to make these designs 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.060
 stay watching this video 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.650
 for this first design we are going to 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.990
 apply our advancement by texture 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.510
 as always to protect the owners 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.310
 of the enamel that we put on then 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.890
 they will grab enamels the color of their 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.420
 taste and go to a white glaze because 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.000
 I'm going to do a technique with the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.740
 sponge so colors stand out 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.870
 even more I always like to be 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.300
 applying a white enamel 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.240
 then to give some color glazes 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.980
 blue and one with finite I wanted to apply a 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.160
 little bit more brightness I'm using one 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.070
 by sally hansen that is called fasic coat 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.900

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.270

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.540
 make me my snow mode for that use 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.780
 a pin with white enamel we are going to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.580
 make us two wheels one now let's 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 make a little bit bigger than the other 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.670
 who is going to do it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.369
 the body of the snow world then you're going to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 grab a black glaze 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's make a few dots for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 other nails or also if you like you can 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.920
 make you other snow monkeys me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.710
 I just wanted to make one on my finger 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.869
 ring then I made her scarf coconut 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.350
 with a blue glaze with a pick 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.030
 teeth I remade in the eyes and I did 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.920
 a nose with orange enamel 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.100
 to clean excess enamel in 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.080
 the fingers use acetone and a cotton swab does not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.390
 forget to apply your protective shine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.130
 for this design to last you 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.420
 much more time 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 [Music] 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.590
 for design number 2 we are going to do 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.590
 some gorditas from papa noel me only 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.420
 I did one on my finger not mine this 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 design is very easy to do 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.250
 start by applying your protective base 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.280
 for all my nails I put a glaze 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 red for my ring finger use a 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 choppers to make a triangle 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.470
 then paint with the enamel paint brush 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.989
 red color what inside will be the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.200
 Santa Claus hat and for my other 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.090
 nails only I did a few dots with 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.129
 a pin 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.410
 to finish the Santa Claus hat 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.050
 let's do not just a few dots 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.150
 with the pin and do not forget to make a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.670
 dot on the top of the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.190
 hat and to finish with this design 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.190
 do not forget to apply your protective shine 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.299
 for design number 3 we're going to 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.670
 be doing some Christmas eyes 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.650
 to start with this design apply your 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.450
 your protective base to protect your 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.480
 nail enamel that we put on top 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.489
 Then I decided to apply an enamel with 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.870
 hair that is one of chinalco says this 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.359
 shine I love 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.489
 it's called one the browns I'll leave you the 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.730
 name in the description box 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.549
 because you like this book is beautiful 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.859
 apply it as 22 layers of this shine 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.230
 so that the enamel stand out even more 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.420
 then you are going to make some lines with 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.970
 some and hot and for the coquitos 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.989
 you are also going to use a pony teeth and you go 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.379
 to use the colors that you use red 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.290
 blue green orange and for what inside 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.540
 the initial deposits and together white 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.909
 do not forget to apply your protective shine 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.359
 so that this design lasts very much 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.359
 more time 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.039
 [Music] 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.850
 another design that is very easy to make and 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.430
 which is very common in these dates of 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.800
 Christmas are the gingerbread cookies and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.780
 you want hedgehog you're going to paint your dreams 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.940
 with a white enamel then you go 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.950
 to grab a is coffee art or any 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.290
 coffee you have I had one that you 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.990
 call then be before leave soft and hansen 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.170
 and with that I did in the ginger monkey 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.720
 he did it using the pin and for the 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.660
 rest of the design I used a pony teeth 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.850
 for the eyes the buttons and for the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.790
 other nails 15 seconds later on the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.540
 principles that I had and apply yourself 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.540
 protective shine 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.340
 for the last design that I'm going to 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.100
 to be sharing is to teach them something 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.410
 different and something very easy for this 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.560
 Christmas that is being applied 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.240
 stickers those are very easy 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.550
 apply and I like it because you do not have 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.850
 that waste a lot of time making you 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.530
 a design on your nails first houses 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.260
 you are going to take the plastic 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.140
 protector that protects the images then 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.760
 You will cut each design individually 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.070
 all the designs that you want to use 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.160
 in your nails then you are going to submerge it 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.900
 in the water 10 to 20 seconds to me 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.450
 I like to apply a little water in 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.600
 my nails so that the image slips 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.210
 before applying it and that it is not going to 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.360
 drying like this is very fast then applied the 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.700
 image in the place where I like 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.890
 and you can move it like that because it has 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.490
 water is going to slide a bit since 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.050
 you have placed the image where you like 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.830
 you can give it a little touch like that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.170
 your fingers 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.050
 it's not the first time I show you some 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.820
 my channel stickers for yours and 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.160
 I really like these are empoli 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.960
 peri store dotcom I will leave you in 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.120
 the description box where the 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.880
 can you buy I like them because they are 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.090
 Easy to apply are not thick and not 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.620
 are you going to take them off easily 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.330
 I remember that before applying 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220
 stickers you can use 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.890
 any enamel that you like 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.310
 I felt that the first release crossing 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.730
 slip was both the designs of the 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.980
 stickers so I removed the design and 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.710
 I applied another glaze that is obvious and 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.170
 It's called Coney Island and I feel like that 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.030
 enamel made it turn out and take the 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.030
 designs and I liked a little more 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.340
 I hope you liked to see this 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.620
 video and if you liked it do not forget to put 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.600
 thumb and your up also make it known 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.090
 in the comments to which of these 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.800
 designs was your favorite I hope that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.169
 Have a merry Christmas and we'll see each other 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.270
 in the next video 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:49.440
