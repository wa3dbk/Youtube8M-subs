samsung epic 4g touch i'm going to zoom

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.910 
samsung epic 4g touch i'm going to zoom
in<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> little<00:03:08.019> bit<00:03:08.139> so<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.620> get<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> little

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
in a little bit so we get a little

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.080 
in a little bit so we get a little
closer<00:03:09.280> view<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.519> looks<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.940> little

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
closer view and if this looks a little

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.090 
closer view and if this looks a little
different<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.410> because<00:03:14.650> I've

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
different position now here's the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.160 
different position now here's the
battery<00:03:24.099> well<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.489> course<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.630> sprint

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
battery well of course this is a sprint

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.800 
battery well of course this is a sprint

network and of course it also uses

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.809 
network and of course it also uses
sprint's<00:03:32.620> 3dm<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.340> 3g<00:03:33.910> network<00:03:34.299> this<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.819> slot

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
sprint's 3dm a 3g network this is a slot

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.509

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
for a micro SD card because this is a

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.289 
for a micro SD card because this is a
sprint<00:03:39.940> phone<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.450> does<00:03:40.630> not<00:03:40.810> use<00:03:41.169> a<00:03:41.500> sim<00:03:41.560> card

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
sprint phone it does not use a sim card

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.819 
sprint phone it does not use a sim card
future<00:03:43.299> sprint<00:03:43.660> phones<00:03:43.870> will<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.349> fact<00:03:44.530> use<00:03:44.799> a

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
future sprint phones will in fact use a

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.949 
future sprint phones will in fact use a
sim<00:03:45.130> card<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:45.730> they<00:03:45.849> will<00:03:46.000> have<00:03:46.180> LTE<00:03:46.419> in

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
sim card because they will have LTE in

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.020 
sim card because they will have LTE in
them<00:03:47.139> but<00:03:47.620> as<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> moment<00:03:48.310> there<00:03:48.669> are<00:03:48.700> no

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
them but as of the moment there are no

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.629 
them but as of the moment there are no
sprint<00:03:49.359> LTE<00:03:49.569> phones<00:03:50.079> so<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:51.040> phone<00:03:51.190> does<00:03:51.430> not

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
sprint LTE phones so this phone does not

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.000 
sprint LTE phones so this phone does not
use<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> sim<00:03:52.150> card<00:03:52.419> what<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.410> does<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.859> of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
use a sim card what it does have of

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.370 
use a sim card what it does have of
