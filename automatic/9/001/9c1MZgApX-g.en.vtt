00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
painted on especially if you look at the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.199 
painted on especially if you look at the
closest<00:02:15.220> diamonds<00:02:15.760> there<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.090> don't

actually look like there are diamonds on
it<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.310> looks<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.549> someone<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.150> painted<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
it it looks like someone has painted a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.830 
it it looks like someone has painted a
diamond<00:02:20.680> pattern<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.340> pattern<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:22.029> the<00:02:22.599> gun

diamond pattern a pattern on the gun

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.539 
diamond pattern a pattern on the gun
which<00:02:23.079> is<00:02:23.260> kind<00:02:23.529> of<00:02:23.650> strange<00:02:23.889> I<00:02:24.189> mean<00:02:24.219> these

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
which is kind of strange I mean these

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.220 
which is kind of strange I mean these
obviously<00:02:24.849> before<00:02:25.810> patch

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
obviously before patch

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.680 
obviously before patch
was<00:02:26.319> extremely<00:02:26.650> difficult<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.420> now

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
was extremely difficult to get and now

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.270 
was extremely difficult to get and now
it's<00:02:28.870> kind<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.140> reasonable<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.769> can<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.190> in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's kind of reasonable you can do it in

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.369 
it's kind of reasonable you can do it in
a<00:02:30.370> day<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.909> grind<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.330> out<00:02:31.450> especially<00:02:32.110> if

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
a day if you grind it out especially if

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.020 
a day if you grind it out especially if
you<00:02:32.470> get<00:02:32.620> lucky<00:02:32.830> with<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.250> dogfight<00:02:33.700> kills

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
you get lucky with the dogfight kills

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
you get lucky with the dogfight kills

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.600 
12 i know a lot of people be interested
in<00:02:37.569> seeing<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.290> other<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.739> looks<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.190> not

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
in seeing what other this looks like not

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.100 
in seeing what other this looks like not
many<00:02:39.700> people<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.269> got<00:02:40.510> one<00:02:40.659> of<00:02:40.750> these<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
many people have got one of these at the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.199 
many people have got one of these at the
moment<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.560> I'll<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.459> honest<00:02:42.700> if<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.970> had<00:02:43.090> to

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
moment and I'll be honest if I had to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.670 
moment and I'll be honest if I had to
rate<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.840> would<00:02:43.989> probably<00:02:44.170> give<00:02:44.530> this

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
rate this I would probably give this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.490 
rate this I would probably give this
camo<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.280> 6<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.330> 10<00:02:46.660> not<00:02:47.049> as<00:02:47.200> good<00:02:47.319> as<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
camo a 6 out of 10 not as good as the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.440 
camo a 6 out of 10 not as good as the
diamond<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.129> black<00:02:48.610> ops<00:02:48.730> 2<00:02:48.849> that's<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.299> sure

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
diamond in black ops 2 that's for sure

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.059 
diamond in black ops 2 that's for sure
but<00:02:49.599> then<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.959> isn't<00:02:50.170> meant<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.560> be<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.920> best

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
but then this isn't meant to be the best

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.400 
but then this isn't meant to be the best
camo<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.060> game<00:02:52.269> royalties<00:02:52.989> obviously

obviously<00:03:02.680> my<00:03:02.799> six<00:03:03.069> out<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.310> ten<00:03:03.579> maybe<00:03:03.790> that's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
obviously my six out of ten maybe that's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.059 
obviously my six out of ten maybe that's
truer<00:03:04.390> maybe<00:03:04.989> that's<00:03:05.170> too<00:03:05.349> harsh<00:03:05.620> maybe<00:03:05.859> it's

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069

too generous you guys decide a little

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.110 
too generous you guys decide a little
bit<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.739> action<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.129> it<00:03:09.250> firing<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.790> guess<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
bit of action of it firing I guess it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000 
bit of action of it firing I guess it
kind<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.629> get<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> little<00:03:10.930> bit<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.379> better
