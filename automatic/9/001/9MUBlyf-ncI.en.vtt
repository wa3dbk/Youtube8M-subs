00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.710
 Cool features I follow you now 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.710
 The intro would like to have fun 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 makes metro of 2 33 teams mortier 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 gets as mp3 de sim based on the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.500
 diamonds I'll show you these 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.969
 all move up or down 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
 turn in a circle 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 and yes you will taste the note when 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.940
 now ask you why they are so big 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 for a category are in the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 Options moore options in the 3d item 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.280
 settings you can yes the size 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 set between 0.5 and 2.0 at the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 items and also at the blocks because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.840
 All of these are also 3d images 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.219
 that looks like all this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 turn also under it 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 a little shadow like the items and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 yes that's the biggest size now 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 not very big now but you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.909
 already notices a clear 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.619
 to make a difference very small 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.130
 Otherwise the function that in the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.320
 picture frames also enchant the items 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 be displayed as enchanted 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.549
 and that's normal microsoft the people 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 at the time of recording not yet the case 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.380
 but the frames are also like that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 set that normal items are not in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 Brooks blocks 3d watch 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 well not exactly be great but they 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.470
 being expressed a little 3d is like that too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 been posted on the website 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.400
 three teams we had even a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.079
 golden apple so an item with a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.659
 Delay looks very cool like yourself 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.030
 the whole thing is turning everyone a lot now 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.720
 items at once and quite a lot 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.550
 seeds that turn 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.230
 Otherwise we would have a cobweb that 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 looks really cool as I think 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.240
 just right you have exactly how 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.410
 the sword and the armor easy 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.860
 just really cool as the times 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.930
 Change and wow I just want 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.870
 blatant that courage that the brook already 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.410
 again for a new minecraft home flight 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.390
 just really real crass I want that 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 I can conclude that I find this 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.690
 murder just just hammer fills like 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 a new microsoft said a bit 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.830
 towards this style with the three teams 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.170
 For me I sensational for the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.970
 murder just really great it is in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.070
 compatible with any texture pack speak 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.990
 every texture pack also has the items 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.300
 3d not swords and yes to luck 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.030
 are all 3d and are turning in nicely 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.280
 circle blablabla if you swing 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.570
 you do not have these prices 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.900
 I just wanted to say that 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.680
 if you want to install at this place 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 then you need her micro forge 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.990
 the murder itself and the head scorpions 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.990
 and 3d items come the mod worry maik 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.870
 rosner and microsoft all class files 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.510
