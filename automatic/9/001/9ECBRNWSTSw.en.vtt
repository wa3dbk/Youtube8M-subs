00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
player and I really agree with it like a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.869 
player and I really agree with it like a
hundred<00:02:44.969> percent<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.719> uh<00:02:46.250> I'd<00:02:47.250> say<00:02:47.310> even<00:02:47.579> a

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879
