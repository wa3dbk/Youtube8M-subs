00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 is the name of the city and has a certain 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.739
 differential that attract many people to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.940
 idea of the prosecutor himself 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.700
 cultural diversity of the city 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.370
 Economic what internal us that makes 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 america only Latin and I think we 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.969
 we need these exchange space a lot 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.000
 of academic experiences 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.590
 that it is the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.939
 book proposes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 clear that there is a smaller scale of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.810
 proportionally smaller in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 several universities across America 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.520
 latin Latin America has several 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 universities as a study center 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 Latin American post programs 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.310
 University graduate 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.090
 What sets Iraq apart is the whole 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.090
 has this approach. 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.740
 the fact that you are next to Tuesday 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 from argentina and paraguay 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.790
 there is the very fact that the university 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.780
 be a university in favor of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.070
 integration 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.220
 this makes Tokyo the only one 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 unit to think about fighting for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.390
 a world where all the walls of the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.360
 feelings should feel proud to live 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.420
 in Latin America right then it was also 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.909
 a city accident because it is one in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.399
 other people in others but 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.970
 not only nail ad 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.350
 who also worked with the middle george 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.459
 Mitchell will meet with other 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.039
 people and other 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 in this mode then you can 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.720
 talk to you can play and have 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:25.920
 various perspectives of a particular 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:28.750
 only in classes specifically to feel it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.750
 speak with Spanish the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.960
 the works are also very well 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 Then I would talk about myself or the process 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.330
 suddenly the teacher is also from another 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.460
 nationality and sofala Spanish only 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.220
 The word is portuguese 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.580
 we have followed a pattern of bidding 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.740
 50% of the vacancies for Brazilians and 50% 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.310
 of the vacancies for the others in the queue 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.980
 Americans the idea is to maintain this standard 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.510
 We hope to develop 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.890
 mechanisms in other countries to 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.920
 facilitates better dissemination to 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.100
 medical possibilities living all the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.020
 one of the 456 years lived together 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.970
 wanting once in Latin America is 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.530
 hard balanced because so functional 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.690
 to eat right 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.890
 so far but when what's there all 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.590
 To stop at the choice I was not on time 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.600
 comes in the house a collective in four years 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.810
 sharing in the village on the street 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.950
 I own Islam, I suspect that we 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.950
 while you n√©
