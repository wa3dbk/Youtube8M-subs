of<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.790> enemy<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.750> has<00:04:16.079> been

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
of the enemy but this has been

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.060 
of the enemy but this has been
incorporated<00:04:16.650> into<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.549> game<00:04:17.789> by<00:04:18.539> wargaming

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
incorporated into the game by wargaming

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.370 
incorporated into the game by wargaming
here<00:04:20.070> for<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.789> last<00:04:20.970> few<00:04:21.180> patches<00:04:21.419> however<00:04:22.289> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
here for the last few patches however I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.370 
here for the last few patches however I
personally<00:04:22.950> find<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.870> positional

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
personally find that the the positional

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.560 
personally find that the the positional
tracking<00:04:25.460> by<00:04:26.460> xbm<00:04:27.030> is

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
tracking by xbm is

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.050 
tracking by xbm is
lot<00:04:27.660> cleaner<00:04:28.080> at<00:04:28.740> least<00:04:28.980> for<00:04:29.190> now<00:04:29.220> than<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:29.910> is

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
lot cleaner at least for now than it is

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.240 
lot cleaner at least for now than it is
a<00:04:30.240> war<00:04:30.450> gaming<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.320> that's<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.800> like<00:04:32.100> to
