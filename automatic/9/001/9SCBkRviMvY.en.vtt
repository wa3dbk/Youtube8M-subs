00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.130
 when you have a showcase without trophies 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.160
 when you see the life of colors take the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 horns the black and white with if I'm 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.960
 in search of better times 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.770
 i 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.390
 and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.239
 I went into where they did not call me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.519
 write wasteful so many tirades 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.399
 I was both good and bad 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.820
 the time at the end happens as well nothing 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.070
 Check the world so expensive but today 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.070
 neither god stops me and so fleeting that the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.350
 dagger you nail it sometimes mind to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.930
 heart trap so bad you have to know 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 how to catch me alone and if what 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 dodge September is with each theme 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 increase in the foundations at the end I knew 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 how to beat all my fears be a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.479
 myth and motor bar respect take a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 rhythm is to follow a straight path the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.490
 insults I take them off and they took off my 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 style was finally my only amulets 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.280
 I insist you accept not to be a cat I step on and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.890
 I pass them with what I admire the one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.659
 could and was not the center resisted before the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.659
 symptoms that I suffer 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 Y 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.350
 try to break your adversity terna 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 your difficulties for your qualities 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 look for why they look for the reasons 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.869
 but now they suffer and there will come times 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 best in the world of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.310
 uncertainty where man is not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 man or anything similar is not passed has not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.409
 designed summit in which man is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.050
 a miserable prototype hungry people 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.450
 thrown in the street dirty rough impulses 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.819
 man gestures vocal cramp 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.860
 pronounce his name movie unveiled 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.680
 and narrated by the trailer dance with the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.420
 moon alone and without bullets pointing me 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 I wrote with a pen when you say that 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.100
 you control you do not control do not worry 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.590
 if you invade the raw doubts was the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.930
 reality until it sing scare to the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.330
 ignorant of my back in which 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.770
 they teach how to create the pandemic and not what 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.810
 that remedies this fucking trance 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.180
 you are our real enemy, everything is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.800
 because we fight between us and we 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.070
 we will support all for the same goal 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.740
 the cure would be obtained sooner not 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.650
 I want with you no physical contact step 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.900
 of you and your conflicts are infinite 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.110
 but mythical by making them smile 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.660
 Atypical joker tries to break your 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.360
 adversities leave your difficulties for 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.490
 your qualities look for why they seek 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.160
 the reasons although it was suffers already see 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.710
 better natives try to break your 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.440
 investments leave your difficulties for 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.660
 your qualities look for why they seek 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.560
 the reasons although now they suffer key from 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.560
 old best 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.920
 when you have a doctrine without trophies 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.320
 when you see the life of colors 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.540
 the bad thing is to see them in black and white 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.140
 because its all in search of times 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.140
