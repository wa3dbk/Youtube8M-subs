00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
we really wanted to recreate the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
we really wanted to recreate the
experience<00:01:18.510> of<00:01:18.690> players<00:01:18.930> sitting<00:01:19.230> around<00:01:19.410> the

table and playing

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.610 
table and playing
so<00:01:22.450> we've<00:01:22.600> taken<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.930> screen<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.290> put<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.560> on

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
so we've taken the screen we put it on

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.200 
so we've taken the screen we put it on
the<00:01:23.680> table

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the table

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.730
