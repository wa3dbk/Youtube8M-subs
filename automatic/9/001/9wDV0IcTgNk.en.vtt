00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
him and so a family member was raising

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.730 
him and so a family member was raising
them<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.300> they<00:03:25.570> decided<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.380> would<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.530> better

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.560 
you're sexually abused or physically
abused<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.100> decided<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.550> this<00:03:30.820> is

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
abused and they decided that this is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.010 
abused and they decided that this is
better<00:03:31.870> than<00:03:31.960> that<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:34.390> if<00:03:34.510> kids<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:34.810> want

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020
