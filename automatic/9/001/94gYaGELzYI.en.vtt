00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 the little game the tipping as say the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 oral english and the approaches one can 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 also we can also call this 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.809
 compartment of the game like that its vast 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 subject and you will agree 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.560
 even if we are all very, very good 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 golfers do not touch all our greens 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.800
 in regulation so that situations 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.350
 around the greens we face it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 is confronted quite often and that's 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 true that situations they are no 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.410
 not unlimited but very many 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.430
 look we can meet we are going to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 create situations it's moreover 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 like that we will work one on this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.020
 chapter game sector we're going to work on 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 concrete situations then very 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.370
 simply down I can have a guy 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.129
 with a lower ball that one there 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 is not bad with a flag here is holding 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 while we are there I can have a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:04.080
 uphill situation we continue ball 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.549
 higher at and in a rush will find 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.240
 a dream a little more here is a ball a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 a little bit depressed we can have 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 this situation there that is not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 uninteresting to have to fly over a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.310
 small obstacles such as a bunker 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.950
 what else do we have? 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 maybe get a little closer to the green 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.280
 we will talk about the near standard 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.049
 will have to make a standard approach a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 all basic look let loose almost to 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.360
 flat twenty meters from the flag 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.820
 about 10 m from fairway and after ten 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.119
 meters of green give a nice touch when 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 the ball is stuck like that against the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.030
 mowing the separation between doing it where 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.390
 she repaints what the english 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.649
 call the fringe and she is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.680
 slightly it rests slightly against 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.450
 7 this necklace of two green loans that's 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.149
 a cost that needs to be worked 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.329
 go was still holding a 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.329
 why not 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.369
 see the little descent up there with 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.319
 the raised green hall was going to be 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.150
 interesting 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.550
 what else roba want I have one 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.319
 funny 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.810
 so even though this post can be removed 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.800
 we can consider or imagine that in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.690
 certain situations 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.670
 well, we can not take it off 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.590
 suddenly the ball is there any 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.599
 close must be played so that's fine 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.810
 involve a left blow 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.569
 hired for us right a little 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.390
 subtlety on this one as well as you 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.200
 to propose other races is infinite 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.100
 can imagine 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.459
 hold hop I throw it by hand 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.040
 a long approach with a lot of 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.220
 green to be able to work precisely 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.519
 his shot and finally I do not know if I'm going 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.400
 have the power to send their 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.920
 egg there I'm even nation by in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 find even be interesting brief you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.470
 have seen options around a green 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.209
 there is almost an infinity of it 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 we will be able to work together on 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.220
 all these situations both on the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.680
 strategic plan but also on the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.130
 postural plan and of course on the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.090
 gestures 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.090
 we'll meet right now
