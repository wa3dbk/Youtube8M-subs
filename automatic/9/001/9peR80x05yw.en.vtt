00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150

 next video where I'll explain how 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 speed up with the metronome in this video 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.479
 re explained just like how to go to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.960
 metronome that is how to do in a way 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 specific a note for each beat 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.010
 then the first thing to do is take 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.900
 once 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.030
 you know that within the metronome there 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.350
 they are numbers that take a long time 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.899
 slow in this case I took 53 e 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 listen let's go listen 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:24.690
 what is the sequence of beats you see 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 which is slow no 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.519
 now that you have the idea of ​​time 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.730
 take the first five notes of the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.959
 scale of do do king soles me and tries a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.150
 make a note to beat then you 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.080
 I suggest to make a joke go to 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.370
 empty 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.750
 that is, counting 1234 without doing anything and then 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.950
 to take the time of the metrò nguini a 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.049
 moment empty beat 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.049
 1 2 3 4 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.580
 ok then what i did i chose 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.140
 once I listened to the various beats of the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.080
 time the on- morizet its born a note 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.000
 for each beat then the first thing to 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.780
 do if you want to learn to play memory 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.180
 is to take the metronome choose a 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.030
 time I suggest you do 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.540
 at the very beginning we say a lot 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.560
 slowly and just follow each 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.330
 beat that is to associate with each 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.330
 beat in the metronome a note
