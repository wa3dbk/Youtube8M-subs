integrated enabled both the camera and
solid<00:00:25.019> layers<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.310> select<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> solid

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
solid layers and then select the solid

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.380 
layer it is not visible at this time
because<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> its<00:00:30.929> place<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> hierarchy

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
because of its place in the hierarchy

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.430 
because of its place in the hierarchy
move<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.780> top<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> door<00:00:34.770> mat<00:00:35.070> layer

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
move it on top of the door mat layer

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
move it on top of the door mat layer
right<00:00:37.440> click<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> solid<00:00:38.370> layer<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> notice

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
right click the solid layer and notice

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.799 
right click the solid layer and notice
how<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.840> set<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> 3d<00:00:41.100> layer<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
how it is set as a 3d layer this is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.500 
how it is set as a 3d layer this is
significant<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:44.160> 3ds<00:00:44.670> max<00:00:44.940> camera<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
significant because a 3ds max camera is

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
significant because a 3ds max camera is
recognized<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.289> an<00:00:46.469> After<00:00:46.739> Effects

therefore<00:00:49.710> work<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.100> tandem<00:00:50.899> scrub<00:00:51.899> the

therefore work in tandem scrub the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
therefore work in tandem scrub the
animation<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.770> notice<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> solid<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
animation and notice how the solid is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.240 
animation and notice how the solid is
animated<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> track<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> camera<00:00:55.829> movements

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
contrary to 2d layers the solid layer

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.960 
contrary to 2d layers the solid layer

coordinates

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.170 

the<00:01:29.140> camera<00:01:29.500> also<00:01:29.680> has<00:01:29.890> transform<00:01:30.610> keyframes

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
the camera also has transform keyframes

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.290 
the camera also has transform keyframes
to<00:01:31.510> ensure<00:01:32.020> camera<00:01:32.470> animation<00:01:32.620> 3ds<00:01:33.460> max<00:01:33.790> is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
to ensure camera animation 3ds max is

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.070 
to ensure camera animation 3ds max is
translated<00:01:35.140> properly<00:01:35.680> into<00:01:35.890> After<00:01:36.190> Effects

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
translated properly into After Effects

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.500 
translated properly into After Effects
so<00:01:38.080> all<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.770> remains<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> be<00:01:39.340> done<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.910> to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
so all that remains to be done is to

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.690 
so all that remains to be done is to
import<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.050> new<00:01:41.320> security<00:01:41.980> screen<00:01:42.280> design

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
import the new security screen design

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.540 
import the new security screen design
and<00:01:43.110> somehow<00:01:44.110> lock<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.950> travel<00:01:45.190> with<00:01:45.520> a
