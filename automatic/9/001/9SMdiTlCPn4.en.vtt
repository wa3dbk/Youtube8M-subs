happen<00:01:18.049> with<00:01:18.229> DMX<00:01:18.590> cable<00:01:18.710> sure<00:01:19.159> can<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:20.119> the

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
happen with DMX cable sure can but the

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.240 
happen with DMX cable sure can but the
likelihood<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.469> happening<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
likelihood of it happening with the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.029 
likelihood of it happening with the
proper<00:01:22.610> cable<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.869> lot<00:01:24.289> less<00:01:24.530> than<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.860> is

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
proper cable is a lot less than it is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.319 
proper cable is a lot less than it is
when<00:01:25.219> you're<00:01:25.369> using<00:01:25.490> mic<00:01:25.759> cables<00:01:26.149> and

when you're using mic cables and
different<00:01:26.570> tables<00:01:26.899> like<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.200> okay<00:01:27.950> make

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
different tables like that okay make

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.340 
different tables like that okay make
sure<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.520> get<00:01:28.610> properly<00:01:29.060> shielded<00:01:29.350> good

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
sure you get properly shielded good

sure you get properly shielded good
quality<00:01:30.860> doesn't<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.729> be<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.880> most

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
quality doesn't have to be the most

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.149 
quality doesn't have to be the most
expensive<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.630> world<00:01:32.689> just<00:01:33.530> good<00:01:33.710> quality

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
expensive in the world just good quality

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.590 
expensive in the world just good quality
cables<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.729> you're<00:01:35.149> going<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.329> be<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> lot

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
cables and you're going to be a lot

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.289 
cables and you're going to be a lot
better<00:01:35.719> off<00:01:36.460> after<00:01:37.460> i<00:01:37.490> started<00:01:37.729> using<00:01:37.880> quality

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
better off after i started using quality

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.120 
better off after i started using quality
cables<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.259> first<00:01:39.439> time<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.680> said<00:01:39.829> my<00:01:39.950> lights

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
cables the first time I said my lights

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.099 
cables the first time I said my lights
up<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.640> all<00:01:40.880> actually<00:01:41.210> work<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.930> first

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
up they all actually work for the first

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.779 
up they all actually work for the first
time<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.320> was<00:01:42.500> amazed<00:01:42.799> they<00:01:43.430> didn't<00:01:43.609> have<00:01:43.700> to

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
time I was amazed they didn't have to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.310 
time I was amazed they didn't have to
sit<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.390> an<00:01:44.450> hour<00:01:44.539> troubleshoot

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
sit there for an hour troubleshoot

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.240 
sit there for an hour troubleshoot
trying<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.680> figure<00:01:45.829> out<00:01:45.859> what<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.130> problem
