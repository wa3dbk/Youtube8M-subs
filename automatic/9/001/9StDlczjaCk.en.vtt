00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.480
 Euro master your asses so he wants to be like that one looks okay hello the goals 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.640
 for some empty and Pierre Merkel said it is not the Japaneseologist 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.679
 become 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.980
 So percent that's a fast court to 5000 york and I have around 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.179
 soon my little army, on the other hand, has its little army 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.619
 they have seen what is supposedly hidden in the forest 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.839
 Surprising Brigitte should be alone begs being seen here 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.739
 and here he sees my opponent's AMI this certifies more balanced than 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.690
 my 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.190
 because I have my only specialized on the table 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.420
 wants during his 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 Well, that's right for the infantry 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.880
 deCarta is called set again the Carter means his set to numbers covered 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.770
 Dr you see del-game with their 18th 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 and it looks very neat 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.620
 So pretty good 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.090
 here you see my Bogener Shigeru are two units in the number behind it 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.049
 Percent two units of Qatar after his election to loose formation 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920
 Salary three years Cavalli units 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.690
 and if general management 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 We think that's great 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.900
 and since my opponent kicked booklets successes are we think that maybe yes 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 also my my Yaris Katharina von to drive her away 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 you have to counter that he has got more Verbruggen in Chile 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.590
 more so now i have to move my career slowly forward first i 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.450
 got the punishment 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.500
 and secondly, the option that the avatar's bodyguard is the disease 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.920
 and I take the chance he in the downhill but my opponent for his 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.979
 Attack archers directly 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 and they fly too 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.159
 because they have the years Kappeler is and nothing to oppose them 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.419
 I have to get rid of my Coral Reefs Daschner ten years ago 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.859
 the student went to smoke 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.010
 I do that then and then, of course, percent of his chamber back 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.969
 elegant my ears 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.139
 nice in the back 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.139
 the opposing cavalry 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.269
 fired by the taz mine another is the siege can me 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.889
 taken after this battle 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.799
 and here's my great light cavalry the one behind 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 Stops should 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.189
 the words of one no half year her pupil watch was discovered and became 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.549
 expelled 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.079
 and now finally two Kathan market around 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.079
 Catalent of Trento hold if my opponent 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.689
 and of course he does not like it that much 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.469
 In any case, he did advise Reding Cavalli Fighting percent of it 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 and my infantry is also making good progress 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.259
 Cadets will protect my dolls pretty much 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.199
 what happens if my avatar is still in the mood for 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.719
 for one thing 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.459
 at school and 2 as the prime time / overview of the units so because 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.629
 had 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.629
 these enemies work well so firstly 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.869
 Kathan units up to seven years the units 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.609
 the athletes have 7 cavalry 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.749
 the cavalry units in Siegenburg fall and the archers in turn 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.729
 the destructive actually around 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.039
 Bastien 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.459
 So the archers are not directly attacked that depends on everything 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.069
 Oh, and here Top 30 in the back of one is doing better than one 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 Therefore unity would come from every case processes 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.529
 So the battle is won 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.239
 One we could look at the results 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.139
 So I had to brake you from 745 my targeted TRK second place after 83 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.259
 and 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.969
 I hope the city Small and do not forget to comment and subscribe
