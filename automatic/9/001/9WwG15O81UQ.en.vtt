 it's a risotto not too normally 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.470

 fish poultry white wine here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.460
 we will do it much simpler 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 that rice that we already bought and then 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 which is already seasoning but that we are going 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.440
 try to embellish to make it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.430
 creamy good it's over talking 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.979

 the maca will read ar yes it's that it's 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.330
 the opposite if trade is going to go I put 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.380
 my faith there in thin slices pans to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.440

 not going to cut perfect it's fine 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.810
 we've already had a lot of reassurance 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.370
 simply cut a small slice of 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.340
 yellow pepper that will bring some 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.730

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.590
 request to go to the head do a little 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.590
