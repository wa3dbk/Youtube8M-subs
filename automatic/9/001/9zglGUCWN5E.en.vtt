00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey what's up Internet so I just got in

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey what's up Internet so I just got in
from<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.659> barn<00:00:04.080> making<00:00:04.650> my<00:00:04.799> new

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
from the barn making my new

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.369 
from the barn making my new
remote-controlled<00:00:05.879> tripod<00:00:06.420> rag<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.140> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
remote-controlled tripod rag and I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.390 
remote-controlled tripod rag and I
forgot<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> giving<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:07.980> guys<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> quick<00:00:08.340> tour

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
forgot to giving you guys a quick tour

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.390 
forgot to giving you guys a quick tour
so<00:00:08.910> check<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.330> out<00:00:09.420> alright<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
so check it out alright so this here is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.890 
so check it out alright so this here is
the<00:00:11.610> rig<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.090> as<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.389> see<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:12.690> pretty

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the rig and as you can see it's pretty

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.999 
the rig and as you can see it's pretty
non<00:00:13.110> complex

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
non complex

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.180 
non complex
it<00:00:14.370> uses<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.330> two<00:00:15.870> way<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.560> channel<00:00:16.800> remote

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it uses this two way to channel remote

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.970 
it uses this two way to channel remote
control<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.109> axes<00:00:19.939> cxi<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> guess<00:00:21.980> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
control it's got two axes cxi I guess so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
control it's got two axes cxi I guess so
yeah<00:00:23.189> let's<00:00:23.400> turn<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> check<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.630> as

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
yeah let's turn on and check it out as

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.519 
yeah let's turn on and check it out as
you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.039> see<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:26.580> around<00:00:27.090> circles<00:00:28.580> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
you can see can go around circles and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
you can see can go around circles and
it's<00:00:31.529> also<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:32.099> some<00:00:32.130> limited<00:00:33.090> up-and-down

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it's also got some limited up-and-down

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
it's also got some limited up-and-down
control<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.100> cameras<00:00:35.520> actually<00:00:35.730> mounted<00:00:36.180> on

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
control this cameras actually mounted on

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
control this cameras actually mounted on
it<00:00:36.420> backward<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.469> wow<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.860> usually<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it backward from wow it usually is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
it backward from wow it usually is
usually<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.450> video<00:00:39.719> carrying<00:00:39.989> mounted<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
usually the video carrying mounted the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
usually the video carrying mounted the
other<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.399> digital<00:00:41.879> camera

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
other way but this digital camera

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.369 
other way but this digital camera
wouldn't<00:00:42.480> fit<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.050> way<00:00:43.170> too<00:00:43.230> exclusive

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
wouldn't fit on that way too exclusive

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.090 
wouldn't fit on that way too exclusive
worth<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> tripod<00:00:44.219> head<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.390> yeah<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
worth the tripod head is so yeah this is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.810 
worth the tripod head is so yeah this is
pretty<00:00:47.340> much<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
pretty much it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
pretty much it
it<00:00:47.940> took<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.230> weekend<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it took me basically this weekend to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
it took me basically this weekend to
build<00:00:49.920> uses<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> remote<00:00:51.989> control

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
build uses just a remote control

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.319 
build uses just a remote control
receiver<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.280> remote<00:00:53.789> control<00:00:54.120> boat

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
receiver out of a remote control boat

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
receiver out of a remote control boat
actually<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.989> two<00:00:55.590> servo<00:00:55.829> motors<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
actually and two servo motors I got a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.049 
actually and two servo motors I got a
head<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> robotics<00:00:57.329> kit<00:00:58.190> uses<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.969> I'll

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
head of a robotics kit uses for it I'll

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
head of a robotics kit uses for it I'll
spin<00:01:00.270> around<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.980> uses<00:01:01.980> four

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
spin around so you can see uses four

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.810 
spin around so you can see uses four
double<00:01:02.670> A<00:01:02.760> batteries<00:01:03.470> two<00:01:04.470> servo<00:01:04.860> motors<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
double A batteries two servo motors the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
double A batteries two servo motors the
CD<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.409> used<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.930> as

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
CD is what is used to go up and down as

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.590 
CD is what is used to go up and down as
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.280> servo<00:01:12.119> motor<00:01:12.240> down

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can see it's got a servo motor down

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
you can see it's got a servo motor down
here<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> bottom<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.710> round<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> round

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
here as a bottom for round and round

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
here as a bottom for round and round
control<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.280> cool<00:01:17.520> forward

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
control so that's pretty cool forward

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
control so that's pretty cool forward
and<00:01:18.270> reverse<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.840> variable<00:01:19.380> speed<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.040> can

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and reverse a variable speed so you can

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.590 
and reverse a variable speed so you can
go<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.689> fast<00:01:22.939> thanks<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> wonders<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
go so or fast thanks to the wonders of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.890 
go so or fast thanks to the wonders of
remote<00:01:25.470> control<00:01:25.860> technology<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.540> yeah<00:01:27.689> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
remote control technology so yeah this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
remote control technology so yeah this
here's<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> down<00:01:28.860> control<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
here's the up and down control as you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
here's the up and down control as you
can<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> CD<00:01:31.380> mounted

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
can see it's actually just a CD mounted

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
can see it's actually just a CD mounted
on<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> servo<00:01:32.460> motor<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> hole<00:01:33.360> drilled<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
on a servo motor with a hole drilled in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.090 
on a servo motor with a hole drilled in
it<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> coat<00:01:34.409> hanger<00:01:34.500> stuck<00:01:34.860> through<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it and a coat hanger stuck through it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
it and a coat hanger stuck through it
and<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> works<00:01:36.030> alright<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and it works alright it's really just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
and it works alright it's really just
used<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> slight<00:01:37.979> correction<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> shot

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
used for a slight correction in the shot

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
used for a slight correction in the shot
in<00:01:39.119> case<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> look<00:01:39.750> upward<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
in case you need to look upward down a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
in case you need to look upward down a
little<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.939> correct<00:01:42.180> what

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
little bit just to kind of correct what

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
little bit just to kind of correct what
you're<00:01:42.509> looking<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.590> yeah<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.700> also<00:01:45.570> forgot

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
you're looking at so yeah I also forgot

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840 
you're looking at so yeah I also forgot
to<00:01:45.960> mention<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.280> completely

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to mention that actually it's completely

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
to mention that actually it's completely
separate<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.329> rest<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> tripod<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
separate from rest of the tripod so as

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.469 
separate from rest of the tripod so as
you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> actually<00:01:50.909> raise<00:01:51.180> or
