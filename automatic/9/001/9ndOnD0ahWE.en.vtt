we're at the ps3 I think it's a great
way<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.340> communicate<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> game<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
way to communicate with the game and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.570 
way to communicate with the game and
sort<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> give<00:02:19.319> new<00:02:19.560> puzzles<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> action
