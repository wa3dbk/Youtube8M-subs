was on the 30 days free trial but I

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.419 
was on the 30 days free trial but I
think<00:00:25.420> it's<00:00:25.539> Ryan<00:00:25.779> out<00:00:25.960> now<00:00:26.170> not<00:00:26.949> checking<00:00:27.220> my

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429

the<00:00:54.190> suggestions<00:00:55.150> for<00:00:55.540> me<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.930> think<00:00:56.050> that's

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
the suggestions for me I think that's

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.450 
the suggestions for me I think that's
what<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:56.740> said<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:59.410> takes<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.830> while<00:00:59.980> as<00:01:00.190> I've

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
what it said it takes a while as I've

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.250 
what it said it takes a while as I've
said<00:01:00.640> performing<00:01:01.240> Internet's<00:01:01.660> quite<00:01:01.930> slow

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
said performing Internet's quite slow

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.000 
said performing Internet's quite slow
but<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.930> would<00:01:05.050> probably<00:01:05.080> go<00:01:05.620> for<00:01:05.860> her

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
but I think it would probably go for her

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.520 
but I think it would probably go for her
for<00:01:06.250> other<00:01:06.490> people<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:09.930> say<00:01:10.930> they've<00:01:11.260> got
