00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.029
 where this will last is nothing because there is no 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.140
 where did I listen to you to cut I did 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.140
 with knife 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:55.340
 So far the mushrooms I hope that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 many olympiacos are cleaned 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.680
 ends with paper cashed 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.510
 with glue 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:23.860
 Seed any part left 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 is a relative of the birds 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.810
 so when they arrive at the house it has flavor 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.810
 to cucumber 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.760
 there is a little bit more 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.000
 but all the vegetables that we have 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.000
 all we have in the refrigerator 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.820
 today he is captain we have three layers of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 evin in all the layers that allow you 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 go building that risk 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.330
 which has a good base 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.690
 the building allows you to build up 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.690
 above 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.870
 so we're going to put it up as 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.720
 going down a director like chocolate 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.340
 optimal to see in what exactly with that already 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.950
 so let's make this last layer 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.950
 of lettuce well 30 there is also fabric 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.960
 we need more cutlery and from there 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.080
 we will have a drawer 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.910
 we put olives in the lettuce and 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.380
 let's put our last good coat 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 good let's clean up a linear problem 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 taste the good of this dish 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.740
 that a plate that the mother can eat and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.870
 the son everything there is difference about the 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.760
 basis of diet and as a kind of things 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 eat for mapfre and is with once 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.570
 lent rich likes everything when mom 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.250
 does not diet 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.250
 that's why it also fattens then and 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.980
 because it feeds more 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.180
 but never again more last time not 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.700
 because he wants the monkey the interest of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.350
 bonus nothing the fist but it is that is 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.830
 returning to be forbidden to the kitten 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.170
 a question this is 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.010
 as a single dish or this is the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.750
 companion of a plate is this missing 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.720
 for example I mix it with a little bit 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.160
 of yogurt because look for it to put 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.160
 Black can get lemon 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.970
 there are people who do not like it 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.970
 also the lemon like that over time 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.130
 that is increasing its streams that is 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.140
 person that I have a bad memory but 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.240
 before and forget I wanted to ask one 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.799
 you can add it to your for example and not 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.840
 you can please you I will add 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.109
 ham you can add some trace of the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.990
 word that come out of the chicks if there 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.000
 nice magic atmosphere but if you are 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.350
 completely vegetarian and vegan them 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.630
 can when hitting roads are 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.890
 using milk so that all money does not 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.130

 they can make the pancakes in the house 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.250
 already but if for example they do not have time 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.890
 You can also buy these tortillas 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.780
 of these as American tacos possible 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.690
 those can when they can use as 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.730
 bread that they buy softer they go to visa 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.070

 I like it a lot, I like it a lot 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.140
 by the sides that can not be fixed 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.880
 we can decorate as well as with some 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.470
 last things I can schedule a little 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.470
 good but well artistic 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:56.130
 we can put a jump so that we 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.130
 give patience 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:12.639
 a little food by mouth as well 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.550

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.569
 summer that still was not hot and I

 They said they have no basis 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.740
 If you are going to save me a bit I told him 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.640

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.640
