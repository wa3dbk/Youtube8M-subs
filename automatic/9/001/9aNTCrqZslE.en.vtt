CT spawn this will cover the CT boxes
and<00:01:00.949> stop<00:01:01.949> ct's<00:01:02.550> pushing<00:01:03.000> through<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and stop ct's pushing through this is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
and stop ct's pushing through this is
perfect<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.670> combination<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.360> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
perfect with the combination of this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.310 
perfect with the combination of this
flash<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.979> grab<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> flash<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.729> well<00:01:09.320> did

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
flash so if we grab a flash as well did

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
close here and you can set it so it just

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
close here and you can set it so it just
bounced<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.619> straight<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.369> won't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bounced this straight off and they won't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
bounced this straight off and they won't
know<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> slightly

different<00:01:43.979> angles<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.729> throw<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
different angles so you can just throw a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
different angles so you can just throw a
little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.990> lighter<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.799> what<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.220> do

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you combine this with the CT spawn smoke

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.380 
you combine this with the CT spawn smoke
this<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> perfect<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:19.140> taking<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.610> site
