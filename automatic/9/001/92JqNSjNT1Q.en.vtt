00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.800

 hello friends today I will show you how 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.509
 clean your pc and maximize your performance 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.420
 and speed up to 300 percent 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.699
 good let's start to achieve this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 we will need to download a program 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.989
 called sick line to download it gives 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.080
 click on the link that I left in the description 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 of this good video now I will show you 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.640
 how to use it first obviously what 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 we open and it will appear that we are in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.030
 the tab of the cleaner will appear 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.030
 what we can clean 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.030
 and then we give it to run cleaner 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.490
 will begin to eliminate the internet cache 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 that are only junk files not 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.350
 they serve for nothing and if they accumulate they occupy 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.380
 lots of space especially facebook and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.180
 youtube are what most trash generates 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.760
 also the history and passwords 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.220
 that are saved occupy space so 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.330
 delete them when finished they will see your pc 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.330
 Too much faster 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 Now we go to the tab 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.910
 tools we select search 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.820
 problems 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.070
 these are the registry errors if you 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.710
 accumulate lower the speed of your pc 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 these registry errors occur 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.690
 by abruptly closing a window or by 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.380
 the records many times streams of 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.380
 social networks 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.200
 yes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.030
 since we have finished we give in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.569
 repair selected and everything is 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.910
 will repair another way to increase the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.370
 performance is removing files 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.680
 hard drive junk for this we're going to 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.110
 our hard drive and we click on the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.080
 folder I have in that folder are saved 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.400
 also many junk files 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.709
 mainly generated by facebook 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.319
 we erase everything in that folder 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.120
 I do not have anything because I deleted it and 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.120
 this is not generated very fast 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.840
