00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.820
 hello friends and now frank and ccoo all 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:16.150
 of the system 40 by 4 because all 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.619
 we can have energy wellness and the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.260
 desired body I find myself here in the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.650
 park because he decided today to go out and take 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 fresh air to run 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 the park the beach or some place that I 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 let me exercise cardiovascularly 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.020
 that this time it was running in a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.460
 ideal place for those who like 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.190
 vary that maybe they do not have the time 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.199
 to go to a gym or investing 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.080
 economic or to buy some equipment 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.730
 so the park is ideal I'll give you 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.530
 some tips on how they can maximize 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 the exercise 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 in the park let's say that being 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.420
 starting to walk what is important is 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.420
 set the distance in the first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 and let's start let's say a mile that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.600
 we can start walking 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.640
 we are not perhaps the first time 30 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.590
 minutes to do it because we will try to 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.230
 look for the next time we can 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 reduce that time by walking a little more 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.890
 fast and progressively we will not go 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 reaching once you go feeling 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 well the next step would be to start 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.780
 jogging in intervals ie 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.720
 hikers 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.470
 then you could try and keep them 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.110
 let's say for about 10 seconds or 15 and so 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.750
 progressively we are going to shorten that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.420
 time that we have decided to start that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.180
 it could have been 30 minutes now what 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.000
 we are reducing so it's going to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.190
 increase the intensity little to 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.759
 little until you can complete it 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.799
 faster way jogging and there he decides 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.890
 if you expand the distance or if then 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.840
 we run or we walk faster than that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.070
 it's a way to maximize school that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.330
 there has to be an effort in the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.240
 exercise 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.350
