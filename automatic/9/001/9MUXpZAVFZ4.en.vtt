because I think like four years enough
you<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:34.020> need<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.620> four<00:00:34.860> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you don't really need more than four in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
you don't really need more than four in
my<00:00:35.550> opinion<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.239> don't<00:00:36.660> even<00:00:36.809> think<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.200> need

more<00:00:37.500> than<00:00:37.559> two<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
more than two but you know for to be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.530 
more than two but you know for to be
sure<00:00:40.309> be<00:00:41.309> sure<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.000> enough<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
sure be sure that you have enough of a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.049 
sure be sure that you have enough of a
memory<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.290> how<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:44.879> much

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
memory like how do you see and how much

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.950 
memory like how do you see and how much
you<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.469> over<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.329> don't<00:00:48.329> oh<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you have this go over here don't oh it's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.700 
you have this go over here don't oh it's
in<00:00:49.079> touch<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
in touch by the way so and just

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.810 
in touch by the way so and just
configuration<00:00:52.710> screen<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> will<00:00:53.760> be

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
configuration screen I think it will be

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
configuration screen I think it will be
in<00:00:54.000> English<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> little

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
in English you just you have the little

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.970 
in English you just you have the little
line<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.530> underneath

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
line over here you just go to underneath

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.180 
line over here you just go to underneath
it<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> do<00:01:00.140> System<00:01:01.140> Security<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it then you do System Security then you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.880 
it then you do System Security then you
go<00:01:02.340> system<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.619> over

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
go system then you can see them out over

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.120 
go system then you can see them out over
here<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> 16<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.659> may<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.170> less<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.010> may

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
here I have 16 you may have less you may

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600 
here I have 16 you may have less you may
have<00:01:08.390> more<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.659> don't<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.400> be<00:01:11.400> sure<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
have more I don't know and be sure you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
have more I don't know and be sure you
also<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> 64-bit<00:01:12.540> operating<00:01:13.260> system

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
also have a 64-bit operating system

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.550 
also have a 64-bit operating system
because<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:16.080> look<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because we will have a look at the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.300 
because we will have a look at the
64-bit<00:01:17.250> Java<00:01:17.490> installation<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.110> second<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
64-bit Java installation and a second so

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.870 
64-bit Java installation and a second so
if<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.140> yet<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> 64

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
if this is so we like yet it is a 64

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.840 
if this is so we like yet it is a 64
then<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.020> next<00:01:25.170> step

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
then you're good to go to the next step

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.950 
then you're good to go to the next step
so<00:01:26.850> let's<00:01:27.180> quickly<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.600> looked<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.900> my

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
three thousand six hundred forty

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.960 
three thousand six hundred forty
megabytes<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.479> before<00:01:39.840> gigabytes<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.710> so

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
megabytes know before gigabytes that so

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
megabytes know before gigabytes that so
that's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.180> big<00:01:42.360> deal<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.079> didn't<00:01:43.649> work<00:01:43.860> for
