00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.580
 already today I will try to recover a loaf 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.620
 of dry polymeric paste and in this 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will use the wire effect number 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 502 which is this glittery green is a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 problem that I also noticed with 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.450
 other pats when glittered but also 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.340
 if closed 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 this problem of dryness though 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 actually this cake opened by 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 a couple of years you see that it is very easy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 the crumble very hard and very dry 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.050
 but it is not pasta that should be thrown away because 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.050
 with a little patience you can recover 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 I used this bag of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.260
 plastic because it has to hold me in place 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.450
 do not have to break because 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 now what I do I'm going to hammer 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
 the pasta with the back of my encore 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 try again any object 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 bluntly obviously pay attention to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.910
 don't hurt yourself because you make them wrong 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 sight 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 you can also use other card type from 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.449
 oven the kitchen but in that case yes 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.960
 instead it will break these under these blows 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.180
 bags remain intact and reduced 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 alterio rman te pasta crumbled 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 even more and then I'm going to get it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.390
 but you can use johnson oil 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.970
 also body creams for the face that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.659
 maybe you don't use anymore but now one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.430
 drop is fine and I go a little 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.390
 mix as best as possible to distribute 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390
 on the pasta 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.710
 then pick up my bag of 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.200
 plastic to keep pasta in place e 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 being able to hammer it a second time e 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.649
 so you will also distribute more 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.409
 the oil I had applied before 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.110
 detachment from the table I try to get a 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.210
 compact compound even though we are still 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.950
 still away from the result the pasta 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.720
 very dry you dirty the net a lot 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 hands you can also use gloves though 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:58.149
 heat of the hands will help you in this 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:00.520
 case to soften the dough I try to 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.170
 recover all the pieces and there 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
 I do the same thing but third time 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.350
 of course, these know that you will have to 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.470
 tell this thing again and see it now 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.580
 that there is a difference the pasta already so 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.310
 first sight is softer too 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.310
 that still dry but now I can 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.510
 only work it in your hands then go 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.959
 I mixed it over and over again I made for 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.030
 2 3 minutes and I advise you to do it on 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.500
 few amounts of pasta 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.510
 also because the pasta recovered in 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.720
 this way, however, tends to dry out 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.829
 faster than other soft pasta e 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.450
 new 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.100
 so I always take some for it 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 the furniture always turns out a bit 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.700
 time and you see the pasta already here 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.700
 now it's softer now it's perfect 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.220
 so the shot doesn't break 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.650
 exactly then result I wanted 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.019
 get ok perfect adessso and this is it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.720
 the difference between dried pasta is 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.140
 instead the one that could resurrect 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.060
 from my stick i hope sd was useful 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.890
 to you can find me on facebook on 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.480
 instagram and I thank you so much
