00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.959
 hi girls here we are with a new one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.910
 video today we're going to fix this is 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.129
 a ghetto denies stress symptom pages 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 and in fact they are mine of maturity e 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.430
 we will go south to settle with the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.839
 bridge method bridge method reconstruction 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 let's proceed with the preparation 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.609
 nail and first thing we will go to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 file the nail surface 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 making it homogeneous precisely because in 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.859
 this long and all bitten symptom 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.859
 we have to make para 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.820
 let's proceed with a simple sphinx on it 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.040
 like a stick in my case 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 orange pushing back the cuticles 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.530
 I recommend passing super super 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.660
 important to avoid possible raises 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.100
 minds of jazz and above all in 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.780
 an awkward union where I am 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 quite wet and then they are 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.230
 always in the mouth is even more important 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.230
 remember that 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.270
 continue with the buffer to dull 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.300
 the nail also because in this case 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.000
 often they are fat therefore it is necessary or 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.560
 walk around to make the gel 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.560
 can take better 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.050
 now we are going to remove all the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.610
 powder that was created I recommend 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.700
 this is also an important step for 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.909
 avoid noises in the gel afterwards and I am 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 doing with a simple old brush 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.130
 perfect finished preparation e 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.929
 let's start with the real one 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.520
 reconstruction I start with this already on 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.950
 transparent preparer of the key 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.140
 cannense this is a series of three gels 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.420
 phases c so this is only the base 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.640
 then there will be the builder and I go to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.470
 place it on my own 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.420
 as if he were a smart in a to do 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 precisely the base I highly recommend 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.310
 important this goes to replace the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 single-phase gel primer c 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.519
 perfect after making that time 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.470
 requires every gelli in lamp I go to 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.269
 degrease my ghetto 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.069
 I'm using the whole kick series 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:29.739
 ass in the lager and now the piece begins 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.010
 strong we proceed by doing precisely this 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.170
 bridge then we take the doctor from one 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.110
 tip a little more chubby and let's go to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.209
 place the gel at the end of the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.549
 our length and even a little on 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.769
 fingertip I recommend not too much 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.900
 gel but not too little yellow because 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.090
 otherwise it will break in two seconds 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.519
 then the already specific is a beige color 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 or flesh-colored but to lengthen the bed 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.310
 nail is fine as a gel and pink 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.459
 what i am using i made the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.950
 perfect catalyzed bridge after having 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.870
 catalyzed awkward I recommend 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.120
 check how much your genres are 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.549
 to catalyze now I go to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.379
 remove the bridge or go to 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.720
 lift it from my fingertip because 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.760
 yellow and then plaice can not stay at 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.310
 contact takes a dotter from the tip 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.370
 finer and I'm going to remove it slowly 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.530
 flat placing the tip under the gel e 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.079
 slowly I move to raise it like 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.629
 just if you wanted to clean the nail from 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.849
 any dirt I recommend gestures 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.099
 very slow because otherwise you raise all the 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.739
 bridge and where to start again then 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.930
 small baskets then you will eventually see 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.980
 a more specific small image 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.829
 destinies to raise the gel and the bridge from the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.599
 fingertip then I take a file because 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:52.690
 I'm going to fix it any things that don't 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.940
 there is and not if maybe it is not para la go 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.299
 to fix and then we start with the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.299
 map 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.630
 perfect now let's start by arranging the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.030
 map I use these transparencies and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.500
 I'm going to arrange the map a bit 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.510
 see just how the system vi 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.330
 I refer to my video on reconstruction 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.910
 with the map, however, turn the roller door 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.590
 a little to make the form c is the I go to 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.049
 put in the bridge that we have 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.919
 created 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.840
 perfect set up a map 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.450
 let's proceed with the construction of the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.250
 of the nail of the stretch then 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.830
 you may proceed doing before all 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.870
 stretch and then do the camber 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.910
 instead I do hard bomb and stretch 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.160
 together this because only in 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.500
 because this case because it is a 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.030
 more natural, more harmonious effect 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.580
 while if I did both 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.950
 first one and then the other line an effect 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.020
 let's say we want a little more fake 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.430
 say it like that, so I'm better off doing 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.710
 both together 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.889
 but I repeat if you are the first weapons you can 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.250
 do very well before stretching and then 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.660
 do and the camber if you want to see 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.250
 how to make a stretch when in the 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.380
 I always refer you to the usual map 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.390
 video on the map if you want instead 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.430
 see how the camber is made just that 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.740
 ask me below or comment on them 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.870
 sooner or later if I succeed I will make you a 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.560
 video on the camber, however you see 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.750
 as it is proceeding I am doing the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.110
 cambering and slowly I'm bringing the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.950
 gel in the part of the map with 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.520
 a lot of perfect attention after 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.780
 having catalyzed here is the result 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.260
 ungraceful I recommend we take the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.030
 file and proceed with the arrangement 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.539
 I proceed by arranging the project margin 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.610
 side system and finally I go to 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.919
 file the camber make it more 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.039
 the system can be homogeneous a little 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.780
 you see enough system on the sides 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.760
 opaque well I do the filing 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.070
 nail too if you want 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.660
 see in particular how to do it at low 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.780
 that you ask me down in the comments neither 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.880
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.170
 filing in during crowning or 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.940
 during a reconstruction if you ask 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.010
 perfect after filing we proceed with 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.050
 remove all the powder that has 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.870
 created however but the most successful I 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.790
 I also go a little to degrease the con l 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.560
 degreaser now let's go and choose 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.840
 simply the color 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.820
 I will do two past of this celestino 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.260
 spectacular but forgive me I don't know of 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.180
 what brand is because you see that 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.919
 all white boxes because I don't 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.690
 remember anyway it goes to 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.490
 spread it like a nail polish 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.040
 so go easy not too much 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.290
 chubby and I recommend you don't touch 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.910
 the perfect girls cuticles for 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.800
 to finish it all will not be enough for you 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.780
 put a sealer I recommend 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.520
 put it well sealed above all 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.340
 on the tip so as to avoid 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.950
 possible raises or things like that 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.050
 then catalyze your hands to wash 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.180
 your customer put an oil for 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.160
 cuticles and here is that result I hope 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.390
 you like it I hope this video there 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.040
 was helpful 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.930
 I recommend let me know if there is 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.940
 it was useful if you have something if it's not there 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.380
 that you didn't understand anything us 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.790
 we see a kiss on the next video 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.790
 hello great beauties
