well<00:00:11.389> put<00:00:11.540> your<00:00:11.719> thinking<00:00:11.870> caps<00:00:12.230> on<00:00:12.410> because

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
well put your thinking caps on because

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.190 
well put your thinking caps on because
for<00:00:12.830> most<00:00:12.950> of<00:00:13.219> us<00:00:13.280> but<00:00:14.030> technical<00:00:14.809> reasons<00:00:15.080> why

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
for most of us but technical reasons why

for most of us but technical reasons why
Browns<00:00:15.500> gasworks<00:00:15.830> are<00:00:16.490> mighty<00:00:16.760> complicated

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
Browns gasworks are mighty complicated

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.000 
Browns gasworks are mighty complicated
to<00:00:17.390> understand<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.380> we're<00:00:18.500> going<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.680> break<00:00:18.890> it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
to understand so we're going to break it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.100 
to understand so we're going to break it
down<00:00:19.099> a<00:00:19.160> little<00:00:19.310> bit<00:00:19.520> Brown's<00:00:20.270> gas<00:00:20.570> begins

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
down a little bit Brown's gas begins

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.200 
down a little bit Brown's gas begins
with<00:00:21.320> water<00:00:21.560> ends<00:00:22.099> with<00:00:22.400> water<00:00:22.640> pretty<00:00:22.880> simple

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
with water ends with water pretty simple

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.960 
with water ends with water pretty simple
when<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:23.779> produces<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.259> flame<00:00:24.560> it<00:00:24.860> does<00:00:25.099> does<00:00:25.759> so

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
when it produces a flame it does does so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.030 
when it produces a flame it does does so

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
definition for a word you hoe tossed

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.210 
definition for a word you hoe tossed
around<00:00:31.910> when<00:00:32.540> something<00:00:32.780> is<00:00:33.110> sublimated<00:00:34.100> in

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
around when something is sublimated in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.310 
around when something is sublimated in
this<00:00:34.370> case<00:00:34.579> it<00:00:34.820> means<00:00:35.000> it's<00:00:35.360> being<00:00:35.840> directly

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
this case it means it's being directly

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.370 
this case it means it's being directly
changed<00:00:36.890> from<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.309> solid<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.880> a<00:00:38.120> gas<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:39.230> here

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
changed from a solid to a gas so here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.730 
changed from a solid to a gas so here
goes<00:00:40.300> what<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.390> professor<00:00:41.900> has<00:00:42.110> done<00:00:42.440> is

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
goes what the professor has done is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.120 
goes what the professor has done is
taking<00:00:43.550> ordinary<00:00:44.180> tap<00:00:44.510> water<00:00:44.980> separated<00:00:45.980> it

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
taking ordinary tap water separated it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.790 
taking ordinary tap water separated it
into<00:00:46.280> two<00:00:46.760> atomic<00:00:47.090> components<00:00:47.680> hydrogen<00:00:48.680> and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
into two atomic components hydrogen and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800 
into two atomic components hydrogen and
oxygen<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:50.150> have<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.450> clean-burning

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
oxygen and now we have a clean-burning

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.100 
oxygen and now we have a clean-burning
fuel<00:00:51.280> that's<00:00:52.280> renewable<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.270> reusable<00:00:53.840> and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
fuel that's renewable and reusable and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.870 
fuel that's renewable and reusable and
when<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:54.830> burn<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.280> goes<00:00:55.430> right<00:00:55.640> back<00:00:55.820> to

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
when you burn it it goes right back to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.950 
when you burn it it goes right back to
water<00:00:56.270> this<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.320> piece<00:00:57.650> of<00:00:58.329> pure<00:00:59.329> tungsten

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
water this is a piece of pure tungsten

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.289 
centigrade close to 59 60 to sublimate
which<00:01:09.710> would<00:01:09.920> take<00:01:10.100> approximately<00:01:10.280> 10<00:01:11.060> times

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
which would take approximately 10 times

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
which would take approximately 10 times
more<00:01:11.539> than<00:01:11.600> what<00:01:11.749> it<00:01:12.079> takes<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.469> weld<00:01:12.740> aluminum

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
more than what it takes to weld aluminum

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
more than what it takes to weld aluminum
without<00:01:14.040> any<00:01:14.310> adjustment<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.210> flame<00:01:15.479> I'm

without any adjustment of this flame I'm
holding<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.740> finger<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.399> we<00:01:18.149> can<00:01:18.420> sublimate

tungsten<00:01:19.710> still<00:01:20.009> instantly<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.060> back

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
tungsten still instantly go right back

tungsten still instantly go right back
to<00:01:21.420> gas<00:01:22.399> Browns<00:01:23.399> fuel<00:01:23.789> is<00:01:23.970> also<00:01:24.270> different

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
to gas Browns fuel is also different

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.090 
to gas Browns fuel is also different
because<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> temperature<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> its<00:01:25.829> flame

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because the temperature of its flame

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
because the temperature of its flame
varies<00:01:26.729> depending<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.869> burning

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
varies depending on what it's burning

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
varies depending on what it's burning
the<00:01:28.710> time<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> say<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.520> flame<00:01:29.759> temperature<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the time to say the flame temperature is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
the time to say the flame temperature is
due<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:30.960> interactive<00:01:31.619> combustion

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
due to an interactive combustion

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.630 
due to an interactive combustion
property<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.360> heat<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.140> produced<00:01:34.649> by<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
hotter the flame gets a reaction is so

what does all this mean what exactly
