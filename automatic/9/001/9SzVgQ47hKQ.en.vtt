00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
passionate about this book I didn't know

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.769 
passionate about this book I didn't know
exactly<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.060> gonna<00:00:18.210> fit<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
exactly what it was gonna fit into the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
exactly what it was gonna fit into the
pod<00:00:19.020> series<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.439> knew<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:19.710> gonna<00:00:19.830> fit<00:00:20.070> in

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
pod series I knew it was gonna fit in

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.620 
pod series I knew it was gonna fit in
there<00:00:20.340> somewhere<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.090> thought<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
there somewhere but I thought that this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.060 
there somewhere but I thought that this
might<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> good<00:00:22.260> time<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.470> start<00:00:22.740> talking

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
might be a good time to start talking

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
might be a good time to start talking
about<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> sense<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.090> uh<00:00:24.500> earlier

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
about it in the sense that uh earlier

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this week we discussed creating a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
this week we discussed creating a
organization<00:00:29.400> where<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.670> lead<00:00:30.269> with

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
organization where we lead with

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
organization where we lead with
questions<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.140> acquisitiveness<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
questions or acquisitiveness to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.780 
questions or acquisitiveness to
encourage<00:00:32.759> learning<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.480> dialogue

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
encourage learning as well as dialogue

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.310 
encourage learning as well as dialogue
and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.880> mentioned<00:00:36.329> mindset<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> mentioned<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and I mentioned mindset I mentioned a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.100 
and I mentioned mindset I mentioned a
fixed<00:00:37.649> mindset<00:00:38.270> in<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.390> book<00:00:39.570> she<00:00:39.719> discusses

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
fixed mindset in this book she discusses

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.889 
fixed mindset in this book she discusses
two<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.309> different<00:00:41.340> mindsets<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
two different two different mindsets the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.610 
two different two different mindsets the
growth<00:00:43.110> mindset<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.579> pursue<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
growth mindset which will pursue and the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.459 
growth mindset which will pursue and the
fixed<00:00:46.920> mindset<00:00:47.930> basically<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> growth

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
fixed mindset basically the growth

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.360 
fixed mindset basically the growth
mindset<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> mindset<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> learning<00:00:52.370> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
mindset is a mindset of learning and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
mindset is a mindset of learning and
basically<00:00:53.850> failure<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.840> learning<00:00:55.140> where<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
basically failure by learning where a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.810 
basically failure by learning where a
fixed<00:00:56.100> mindset<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.850> basically<00:00:57.629> failures

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
fixed mindset is basically failures

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
fixed mindset is basically failures
defining<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.969> success<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:00.870> failures

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
defining you success or failures

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.250 
defining you success or failures
failures<00:01:01.770> define<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.870> basically<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
failures define you but basically the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
failures define you but basically the
fact<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.000> there<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.330> there's<00:01:07.200> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
fact that there is this there's this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.550 
fact that there is this there's this
inertia<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.490> failure<00:01:09.150> being<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.780> bad<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
inertia of failure being so bad to the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
inertia of failure being so bad to the
fixed<00:01:11.040> mindset<00:01:11.189> person<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> never

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
fixed mindset person that they never

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.570 
fixed mindset person that they never
want<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> fail<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.070> they'll<00:01:14.430> do

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
want to fail and will do they'll do

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.039 
want to fail and will do they'll do
crazy<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> they'll<00:01:15.810> they'll

crazy things not to they'll they'll

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
crazy things not to they'll they'll
blame<00:01:16.320> they'll<00:01:16.770> cheat<00:01:17.040> they'll<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.460> lots<00:01:17.759> of

blame they'll cheat they'll do lots of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
blame they'll cheat they'll do lots of
different<00:01:17.970> things<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> fail<00:01:19.200> because

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
different things not to fail because

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.249 
different things not to fail because
there's<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.850> inertia<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.900> early

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
there's all of this inertia from early

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.789 
there's all of this inertia from early
on<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.920> training<00:01:24.470> Carley<00:01:25.470> genetic

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
on and in training Carley genetic

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
on and in training Carley genetic
probably<00:01:26.070> partly<00:01:26.280> environmental<00:01:26.850> play<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
probably partly environmental play the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably partly environmental play the
nature<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.479> nurture<00:01:27.600> thing<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
nature and nurture thing but but this is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
nature and nurture thing but but this is
inertia<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.750> failing<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> becomes

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
inertia about failing and so it becomes

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980 
inertia about failing and so it becomes
very<00:01:32.460> destructive<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> she<00:01:33.420> looks<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.840> lot

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
very destructive and she looks in a lot

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140 
very destructive and she looks in a lot
of<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.200> areas<00:01:34.770> within<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> book<00:01:35.939> both

us<00:01:47.990> basically<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.799> three<00:01:49.979> ways<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.579> what

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
us basically the three ways that what

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
us basically the three ways that what
we've<00:01:51.299> been<00:01:51.630> looking<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.170> week<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.740> will

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
we've been looking at this week and will

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.709 
we've been looking at this week and will
continue<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.610> look<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.799> in

continue to look at it is is one in

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.940 
continue to look at it is is one in
basically<00:01:57.719> looking<00:01:58.229> directly<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.829> our

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
basically looking directly into our
