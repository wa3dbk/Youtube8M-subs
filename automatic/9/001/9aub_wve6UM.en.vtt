00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.850
 hello to all and welcome to my first tutorial explain how 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.499
 to make a face change so cluster your face in face 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.070
 of what I did so we chose the picture no less than a man 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 the door 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.489
 so in the first place what are we going to do 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.749
 you look for 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.939
 actually look for 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 an image that you want to edit so not first you've opened 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.700
 this image 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 be cs4 and cs5 rather excellent 5 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.410
 this is the first picture 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.960
 and we will open 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 our second of image 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.010
 In another 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 in an other 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.760
 we'll start earlier so it's pretty simple 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 first place 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120
 you get by 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.760
 unlock your someone 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 we will take the assault 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.690
 to follow 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 part of the face so we take here 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 above by pulling 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 we continue 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.860
 of course 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.700
 and we have a vase 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 these parts kill wise is surrounded we're going to give it a progressive outline 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.900
 which is very important in you go to selection 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870
 improve the outline 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.720
 chicas phelps trimmings so you go in 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.030
 contour detection 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.720
 pixels benjamines 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 and to adjust the progressive contour to 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 28th captain 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 if you do ok 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.590
 opacity 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.870
 you do shift control 2 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.870
 alerted the section and you press delete all 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 in case of control 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.100
 selected 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.730
 he is in selection 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.550
 get the selection 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 face standing 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.109
 you're doing editing 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.379
 you go it's not too early calkins 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.349
 drop as 5% 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
 editions 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.509
 here is lotus here 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.340
 in the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.219
 shrink what is chicane 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.439
 for men 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.700
 at the level of the face 6 we count progressive you noticed he takes 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.719
 it gives an effect 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.589
 on the edge of the face 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 hofesh shechter 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:46.579
 you come back 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.729
 understand you put 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 no matter here 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.569
 you take a 100% method 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 you go down 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.099
 take your face 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.479
 you put in front 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 simple loquacity 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.789
 at 4 1% 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.089
 we are always a little eyes first understand 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.699
 I'm just one more time 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 you go down 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.449
 we arrive here it's still a little too big we go down 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.709
 and here we come 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.469
 like to say that you can 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.929
 - afp 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.369
 as we can see 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.479
 the face 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.479
 concord 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.349
 then in volume of milk anyway we go to the opposite because 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.309
 symmetrical horizontal axis 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.579
 when we have 100% 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.499
 and then we will settle 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.180
 hue and saturation 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.490
 so we go in the picture 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.360
 settings 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.889
 and saturation 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.889
 lisandro give him ap 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.740
 1-4 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 - 4 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.210
 we will go down below 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.110
 this 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.110
 in all the union in the color we want 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.900
 candles follow 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.860
 see their 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.180
 we will have to do something about right 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.669
 who gets married pretty much with the face 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.669
 and at worst falling ratio will increase so little crazy 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.860
 we go down to 100% 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.939
 we get an image 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.329
 roughly separates his super super godfathers 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.289
 neuroimage that match the equipment 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.709
 with the character we will move a little face they will go down 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.990
 we will then have what gives you 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.960
 a nice little rendering 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.069
 I hope that 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.199
 it's utopian 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.190
 you will have agreed
