00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:04.930
 Even if one week of airpen passes, it is abnormal overheating, though 

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.040
 How is the atmosphere of the team 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.400
 I have a nice weather 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 That Shiga I drew last year in that good atmosphere 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.289
 Pull first 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.990
 It creates a good atmosphere and new players are also good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.989
 but 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.900
 that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 It is always the best high ten 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.380
 As a man who is new but a child, he decides to open the goal 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.399
 Do you think it is good 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.220
 Officially decided within the current fiscal year 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.000
 In the statement 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.280
 It may be cheaper than I really believe 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.700
 Just make it a new theme 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.170
 Everyone has been a big week ago 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.630
 I'm Sekimachi 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.760
 Specifically, compare with this and try it now with warriors 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 My call 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.530
 I have thrown away the bodies of 2 people who can be used on aircraft 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.400
 Or 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 Well to some extent 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.460
 Because I live 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.980
 The role of slender is 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 I also carry out the rate of return by myself 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.940
 Well people are so much 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600
 Tougan ceo to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.710
 Without Chiba 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.600
 Went as usual 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.260
 that is 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.030
 Team influence at once 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.080
 I think it would be good if I could do it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 The camp with a heart to want to go out actually continues from here 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.660
 I think it will be a fairly long camp life 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.440
 How is it? 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 It even flies from the beginning and becomes representative 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 That long while thinking of my long head 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.570
 10 sen 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.270
 Port port communication plan 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 I'm thinking that I would like to bring more unity 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.119
 I think that I really hate low prices and Japan, but the war 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.640
 Rule had returned 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.540
 I agree 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.500
 After all in the pitch 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.030
 But in it really 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.870
 In the way I really do it 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.030
 url 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.820
 Because of the harbor 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.990
 First of all 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.739
 Not look 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.639
 I think I really want Atsuya 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.639
 Update personally but please tell us your goals etc. 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.139
 That's right 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.009
 Chiyo Oumi 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 To be able to fully demonstrate your power 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.739
 With the result left 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.749
 team 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.789
 catfish 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.829
 Mr. Taku who leaves good results in the team 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.429
 It is solid as a living sea 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.529
 Finally it belongs to supporters in Sendai 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.659
 Good luck together 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.169
 I can not get through the ground 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.529
 As warriors unite and work hard, we support 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:54.649
 Thank you
