that<00:00:25.650> would<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.070> would<00:00:26.250> modify<00:00:26.640> those<00:00:26.939> rifles

but<00:00:27.570> nothing<00:00:28.470> has<00:00:28.619> been<00:00:28.650> done<00:00:29.010> yet<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
but nothing has been done yet do you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.609 
but nothing has been done yet do you
think<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:30.480> didn't<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.900> anything<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
think they didn't do anything about this

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.720 
think they didn't do anything about this
on<00:00:31.830> purpose<00:00:33.950> well<00:00:34.950> essentially<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.370> think<00:00:35.640> they

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
on purpose well essentially I think they

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
on purpose well essentially I think they
thought<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> story<00:00:36.719> would<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.290> away<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
thought that the story would go away and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.430 
thought that the story would go away and
fizzle<00:00:37.980> itself<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.930> too<00:00:40.110> common

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
fizzle itself out it's a not too common

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
fizzle itself out it's a not too common
these<00:00:40.469> days<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.890> mainstream<00:00:41.399> press<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
these days that mainstream press that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
these days that mainstream press that
reaches<00:00:42.180> millions<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.350> audience<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:44.010> able

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
reaches millions of an audience is able

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180 
reaches millions of an audience is able
to<00:00:44.820> reveal<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> story<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to reveal a story like this and it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.660 
to reveal a story like this and it
suggests<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:49.520> government<00:00:50.520> itself

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
suggests that the government itself

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
suggests that the government itself
thought<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.510> would<00:00:51.629> probably<00:00:51.870> forget

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
thought that they would probably forget

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.350 
thought that they would probably forget
the<00:00:52.770> attention<00:00:53.190> span<00:00:53.219> seems<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.149> very

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the attention span seems to be very

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
the attention span seems to be very
short<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.410> days<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
short to these days and so I think it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.950 
short to these days and so I think it
was<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> matter<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.449> waiting<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
was just a matter of them waiting but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
was just a matter of them waiting but
now<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.260> they've<00:00:58.410> continued<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> apply<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
now that they've continued to apply the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.630 
now that they've continued to apply the
pressure<00:01:00.079> coming<00:01:01.079> from<00:01:01.230> different<00:01:02.010> movements

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
pressure coming from different movements

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.020 
pressure coming from different movements
to<00:01:03.000> try<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> force<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> remove<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
to try to force them to remove the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
to try to force them to remove the
Biblical<00:01:06.030> verses<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> you'll<00:01:07.140> see

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Biblical verses I think that you'll see

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
Biblical verses I think that you'll see
that<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.950> respond<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that they have to respond because the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.080 
that they have to respond because the
citizenry<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:09.979> woken<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> say<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
citizenry has woken up so to say to a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
citizenry has woken up so to say to a
degree<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.290> able<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> force<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
degree that they are able to force it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
degree that they are able to force it
and<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.509> curious<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.140> hear<00:01:16.350> from

you<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you about if you think this is just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
you about if you think this is just
ignorance<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> part<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> Defense

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
ignorance on the part of the Defense

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
ignorance on the part of the Defense
Department<00:01:21.090> perhaps<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.080> had<00:01:22.229> no<00:01:22.409> idea

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
could there be something more sinister

could there be something more sinister
behind<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.509> may<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.049> Defense

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
