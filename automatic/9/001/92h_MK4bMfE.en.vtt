00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
a little run tests before we attempt to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.519 
a little run tests before we attempt to
stick<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:04.859> back<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.310> car<00:00:06.350> just<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> make

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
stick it back in the car just to make

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
stick it back in the car just to make
sure<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.830> didn't<00:00:08.040> not<00:00:08.849> get<00:00:09.030> anything<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.330> of

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
sure we didn't not get anything out of

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.870 
sure we didn't not get anything out of
alignment<00:00:09.630> when<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> took<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.440> apart<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
alignment when I took it apart to

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.520 
alignment when I took it apart to
whittle<00:00:11.880> down<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.090> shape<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.719> adaptive

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
whittle down the shape of the adaptive

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.640 
whittle down the shape of the adaptive
lips<00:00:13.740> up<00:00:14.780> fingers<00:00:15.780> crossed<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.190> go

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.480 

it's<00:00:22.650> running<00:00:22.890> very<00:00:23.279> true<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.150> smooth

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it's running very true it's very smooth

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.680 
it's running very true it's very smooth
there<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.090> no<00:00:27.300> unusual<00:00:27.810> noises

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.680 

factually<00:00:31.590> okay

factually okay

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
factually okay
vibration<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.200> all<00:00:34.580> so<00:00:35.580> I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.760> we're

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
vibration in it at all so I think we're

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
vibration in it at all so I think we're
doing<00:00:36.240> very<00:00:36.660> well<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.470> this<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:37.830> back<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
doing very well get this put back in the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
doing very well get this put back in the
car<00:00:38.990> get<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.110> front<00:00:40.350> end<00:00:40.500> put<00:00:40.680> back<00:00:40.830> together

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
car get the front end put back together

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.800 
car get the front end put back together
and<00:00:41.490> then<00:00:41.700> we'll<00:00:41.850> give<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> another<00:00:42.180> test

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
and then we'll give it another test

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.080 
and then we'll give it another test
juice<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> watch<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.310> winds<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.880> wheel

important thing the passenger side motor

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.920 
important thing the passenger side motor
mount<00:02:56.130> have<00:02:56.880> your<00:02:57.120> room<00:02:57.270> obviously<00:02:57.480> because

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
mount have your room obviously because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.860 
mount have your room obviously because
it<00:02:58.050> didn't<00:02:58.910> there's<00:02:59.910> no<00:03:00.060> engine<00:03:00.420> therefore<00:03:00.780> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it didn't there's no engine therefore it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.780 
it didn't there's no engine therefore it
amount<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.860> we're<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.640> have

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
amount to so we're going to have to have

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.180 
amount to so we're going to have to have

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
hold that in the right place once we get

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.270 
hold that in the right place once we get
those<00:03:21.120> two<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.650> should<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
those two or that it should really be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.680 
those two or that it should really be
one<00:03:23.580> component<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:24.120> once<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.390> get<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
one component or once we get that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.470 
one component or once we get that
finished<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.160> we're<00:03:26.880> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> start

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
finished then we're going to start

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.090 
finished then we're going to start
putting<00:03:27.660> all<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> EV<00:03:28.230> components<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.830> we're

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
putting all the EV components in we're

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.860 
putting all the EV components in we're
going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.400> able<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.610> put<00:03:29.790> battery<00:03:30.600> racks

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
going to be able to put battery racks

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.810 
going to be able to put battery racks
place<00:03:31.260> all<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.530> batteries<00:03:31.739> lay<00:03:32.519> out<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
place all the batteries lay out the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.190 
place all the batteries lay out the
control<00:03:33.150> board<00:03:33.330> with<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.570> controller<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
control board with the controller and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.979 
control board with the controller and
contact<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.800> DC<00:03:35.100> DC<00:03:35.400> converter<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.840> that

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
contact or DC DC converter all of that

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.460 
contact or DC DC converter all of that
sort<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.380> thing<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:39.420> once<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.110> mounts

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
sort of thing so really once that mounts

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.259 
sort of thing so really once that mounts
finished<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.980> should<00:03:41.160> be<00:03:41.310> pretty<00:03:41.549> quick<00:03:41.820> going

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
finished it should be pretty quick going

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.240 
finished it should be pretty quick going
a<00:03:42.420> lot<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.780> wiring<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> lot<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> little

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
a lot of wiring to do a lot of little

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.180 
a lot of wiring to do a lot of little
things<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.880> figure<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
things to figure out but this is the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.729 
things to figure out but this is the
bulk<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> actual<00:03:48.420> physical<00:03:49.080> work<00:03:49.290> this

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
bulk of the actual physical work this

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.789 
bulk of the actual physical work this
stuff<00:03:50.100> right<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:51.200> getting<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.350> engine<00:03:52.650> out

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
stuff right here getting that engine out

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.530 
stuff right here getting that engine out
getting<00:03:53.400> everything<00:03:53.580> related<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.269> engine

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
getting everything related to the engine

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.960 
getting everything related to the engine
out<00:03:54.860> making<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.890> adapter<00:03:56.340> plate<00:03:56.549> getting<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
out making the adapter plate getting the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.280 
out making the adapter plate getting the
electric<00:03:57.269> motor<00:03:57.480> made<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
electric motor made it to the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.050 
electric motor made it to the
transmission<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.100> getting<00:03:59.310> babble<00:03:59.700> assembly

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
transmission and getting babble assembly

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.280 
transmission and getting babble assembly
back<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.720> every

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
back in and every

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.920 
back in and every
back<00:04:01.409> together<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.980> am<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:02.969> tempted<00:04:03.510> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
back together I am really tempted to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.020 
back together I am really tempted to
fire<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.860> up<00:04:04.980> give<00:04:05.189> some<00:04:05.400> juice<00:04:05.579> or<00:04:05.700> watch<00:04:05.849> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
fire it up give some juice or watch the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.479 
fire it up give some juice or watch the
wheel<00:04:06.209> spin<00:04:06.629> but<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.260> don't<00:04:08.159> want<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.459> that

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
wheel spin but I don't want to do that

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.420 
wheel spin but I don't want to do that
because<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.000> passenger<00:04:09.689> axel<00:04:10.140> isn't<00:04:10.680> isn't

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
because that passenger axel isn't isn't

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.729 
because that passenger axel isn't isn't
attached<00:04:11.969> properly<00:04:12.420> yet<00:04:12.689> so<00:04:12.900> I'm<00:04:13.049> going<00:04:13.680> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
attached properly yet so I'm going to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.559 
attached properly yet so I'm going to
hold<00:04:13.859> up<00:04:14.040> i'm<00:04:14.280> going<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.519> be<00:04:14.579> patient<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.299> i'm

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
hold up i'm going to be patient and i'm

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.509 
hold up i'm going to be patient and i'm
going<00:04:15.719> to<00:04:15.780> wait<00:04:15.900> till<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.259> right<00:04:16.470> then<00:04:17.340> we

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
going to wait till it's right then we

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.740 
going to wait till it's right then we
can<00:04:17.669> spin<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.910> up<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.209> we'll<00:04:18.299> see<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.570> wheels

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
can spin it up and we'll see the wheels

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.689 
can spin it up and we'll see the wheels
turn<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.620> we're<00:04:20.009> coming<00:04:20.190> along<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.549> nicely

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
turn so we're coming along pretty nicely

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.959 
turn so we're coming along pretty nicely
thanks<00:04:21.389> for<00:04:21.509> sticking<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:21.840> me
