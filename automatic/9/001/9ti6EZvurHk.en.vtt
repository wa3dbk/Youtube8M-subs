thought we'd play some good football at

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220 
thought we'd play some good football at
times<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:18.790> just<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.540> final<00:00:19.720> board<00:00:20.020> again

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230

but that'll come in you can see the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.890 
but that'll come in you can see the
confidence<00:00:21.790> back<00:00:22.150> with<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.390> team<00:00:22.599> and<00:00:22.750> I'm

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
attack all things like this so it's a

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.409 
attack all things like this so it's a
small<00:00:26.829> step<00:00:26.919> for<00:00:27.189> not<00:00:27.430> not<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.790> huge<00:00:28.060> one<00:00:28.090> but<00:00:28.360> a

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
small step for not not a huge one but a

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.510 
small step for not not a huge one but a
small<00:00:28.660> step<00:00:28.869> forward<00:00:29.079> and<00:00:29.230> it's<00:00:29.770> nice<00:00:29.919> to<00:00:30.130> win

watch<00:01:00.850> our<00:01:01.030> teams<00:01:01.239> playing<00:01:01.539> that's<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:02.649> they

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
watch our teams playing that's what they

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.110 
watch our teams playing that's what they
do<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.190> know<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.519> worked<00:01:03.699> right<00:01:03.850> from<00:01:04.030> the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
do you know it worked right from the

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.850 
do you know it worked right from the
front<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.449> mean<00:01:04.600> our<00:01:04.690> best<00:01:04.839> defender<00:01:05.199> is<00:01:05.409> James

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
front I mean our best defender is James

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.430 
front I mean our best defender is James
Collins<00:01:06.100> at<00:01:06.310> times<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:07.630> best<00:01:07.840> attack<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.290> our

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
Collins at times my best attack is our

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.830 
Collins at times my best attack is our
fallback<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:10.360> we<00:01:10.450> try<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.660> do

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
fallback so that's what we try and do

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.630 
fallback so that's what we try and do
but<00:01:11.050> I<00:01:11.500> thought<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:11.920> was<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.070> great<00:01:12.190> team<00:01:12.490> effort

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
but I thought it was a great team effort

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.160 
but I thought it was a great team effort
from<00:01:12.910> everyone<00:01:13.090> everyone<00:01:13.510> knew<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.660> jobs<00:01:14.020> and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
from everyone everyone knew the jobs and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.170 
from everyone everyone knew the jobs and
they<00:01:14.230> were<00:01:14.320> they<00:01:14.410> had<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.650> do<00:01:14.800> didn't<00:01:15.790> dive<00:01:15.940> in

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
they were they had to do didn't dive in

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.670 
they were they had to do didn't dive in
didn't<00:01:16.420> commit<00:01:16.600> themselves<00:01:16.840> work<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.440> socks

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
didn't commit themselves work the socks

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.740 
didn't commit themselves work the socks
off<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.250> got<00:01:18.520> toes<00:01:18.730> and<00:01:18.970> legs<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.330> arms<00:01:19.630> and

heads and all that in here everywhere

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.770 
heads and all that in here everywhere
that's<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.970> sort<00:01:22.150> of<00:01:22.180> thing<00:01:22.270> when<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.540> wonder

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
that's the sort of thing when you wonder

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.630 
that's the sort of thing when you wonder
laugh<00:01:22.930> when<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.170> go<00:01:23.260> down<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.440> 10<00:01:23.710> min<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.460> does

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
laugh when you go down to 10 min it does

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.450 
laugh when you go down to 10 min it does
make<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.850> more<00:01:25.150> resolve<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:26.010> not<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.160> concede

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
make you more resolve to not to concede

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.560 
make you more resolve to not to concede
it<00:01:27.760> does<00:01:27.940> make<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.120> feel<00:01:28.780> more<00:01:28.930> determined<00:01:29.440> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it does make you feel more determined to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.790 
it does make you feel more determined to
make<00:01:31.570> sure<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:31.900> Ross<00:01:32.320> County<00:01:32.440> don't<00:01:32.650> have<00:01:32.740> a
