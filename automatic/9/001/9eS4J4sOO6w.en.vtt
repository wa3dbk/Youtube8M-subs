the<00:00:23.070> intermediate<00:00:23.369> pipe<00:00:23.939> section<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the intermediate pipe section now you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
the intermediate pipe section now you
see<00:00:25.199> two<00:00:25.410> intermediate<00:00:25.949> pipes<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.970> kit

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
see two intermediate pipes here this kit

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.810 
see two intermediate pipes here this kit
will<00:00:27.449> work<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> VA<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> v6<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
will work for the VA or the v6 the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
will work for the VA or the v6 the
shorter<00:00:30.210> intermediate<00:00:30.720> pipe<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> v8

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
shorter intermediate pipe is for the v8

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.040 
shorter intermediate pipe is for the v8
and<00:00:32.219> since<00:00:32.790> ours<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> v6<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and since ours is a v6 we're going to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
and since ours is a v6 we're going to
use<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> longer<00:00:34.590> intermediate<00:00:35.190> pipe<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:36.000> also

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
use the longer intermediate pipe it also

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
use the longer intermediate pipe it also
comes<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.570> full<00:00:36.719> set<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> instructions<00:00:37.800> your

there's a few Isolators and a few bolts

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
there's a few Isolators and a few bolts
we've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> revealed<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.590> furthest<00:00:53.100> back

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we've got it revealed the furthest back

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
we've got it revealed the furthest back
isolator<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:55.250> we'll

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
isolator is right here in the back we'll

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
isolator is right here in the back we'll
remove<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> muffler<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.289> muffler

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.060 
unit from the isolator so now we're on
to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> next<00:01:03.719> isolator<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.650> one's<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to the next isolator this one's on the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.969 
to the next isolator this one's on the
backside<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> muffler<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.500> also<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
backside of the muffler and we also have

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.600 
backside of the muffler and we also have
two<00:01:08.820> bolts<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.229> backside<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> muffler

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
two bolts on the backside of the muffler

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
two bolts on the backside of the muffler
pipe<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.659> run<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> tailpipe<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
pipe that run to the tailpipe to do that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
pipe that run to the tailpipe to do that
we<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> remove<00:01:14.970> we've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> remove

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
we need to remove we've got to remove

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.440 
we need to remove we've got to remove
one<00:01:17.130> bolt<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.119> bolt<00:01:18.330> from

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
one bolt from here and one bolt from

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.859 
one bolt from here and one bolt from
here<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.619> backside<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> muffler<00:01:20.869> all

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
here on the backside of the muffler all

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
here on the backside of the muffler all
right<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> front<00:01:23.130> side<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
right so now on the front side of the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950 
right so now on the front side of the
muffler<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.060> another<00:01:24.270> hanger<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.840> an

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
muffler we have another hanger with an

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.120 
muffler we have another hanger with an
isolator<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> remove<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
isolator so we have to remove that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.210 
isolator so we have to remove that
isolator<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.259> then<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.470> more<00:01:28.680> isolator<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
isolator and then one more isolator a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.780 
isolator and then one more isolator a
little<00:01:29.549> further<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> intermediate<00:01:30.780> pipe

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
little further up the intermediate pipe

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.179 
little further up the intermediate pipe
so<00:01:32.790> we've<00:01:32.939> got<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.240> isolator<00:01:34.040> left<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
so we've got this one isolator left to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
so we've got this one isolator left to
take<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:36.140> two<00:01:37.140> bolts<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:37.650> our<00:01:37.829> intermediate

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
take out two bolts from our intermediate

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880 
take out two bolts from our intermediate
pipe<00:01:38.520> once<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.780> we'll<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.530> able<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
pipe once those are out we'll be able to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
pipe once those are out we'll be able to
remove<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> whole<00:01:41.460> exhaust<00:01:41.729> system<00:01:42.210> now

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
remove the whole exhaust system now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.899 
remove the whole exhaust system now
remember<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.250> easier<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> use<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
remember it's a lot easier to use a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
remember it's a lot easier to use a
little<00:01:45.180> penetrating<00:01:45.720> oil<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.229> bolts

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
little penetrating oil on these bolts

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
little penetrating oil on these bolts
and<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> Isolators<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> order<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> get

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and the Isolators in order to get

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.389 
and the Isolators in order to get
everything<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.810> smoothly<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.009> first<00:01:50.280> we're
