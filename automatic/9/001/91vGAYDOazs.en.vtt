00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
going to go over some changes that I
missed<00:00:21.870> last<00:00:22.170> time<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.610> very

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
missed last time but which are very

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.420 
missed last time but which are very
important<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.320> hunter<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> any<00:00:26.190> other

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
important to the hunter and any other

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.130 
important to the hunter and any other
class<00:00:26.779> change<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
class change and that is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.400 
class change and that is
pets<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:31.220> get<00:00:31.580> 40%<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.720> their<00:00:32.900> masters

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
pets now get 40% of their masters

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.950 
pets now get 40% of their masters
resilience<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.360> means<00:00:35.600> is<00:00:35.930> that

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
resilience and what that means is that

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.980 
resilience and what that means is that
pets<00:00:36.860> would<00:00:37.280> be<00:00:37.490> a<00:00:37.520> little<00:00:37.970> bit<00:00:38.270> more<00:00:38.510> viable

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
pets would be a little bit more viable

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.640 
pets would be a little bit more viable
in<00:00:39.320> PvP<00:00:40.040> before<00:00:41.030> pets<00:00:41.420> died<00:00:41.780> too<00:00:42.080> quickly<00:00:42.320> and

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
in PvP before pets died too quickly and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.310 
in PvP before pets died too quickly and
so<00:00:43.280> if<00:00:43.430> you're<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.640> beast<00:00:43.880> master<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.960> means<00:00:45.170> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
so if you're a beast master that means a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.860 
so if you're a beast master that means a
big<00:00:45.500> chunk<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.040> your<00:00:46.100> DPS<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:46.880> instantly<00:00:47.570> gone

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
big chunk of your DPS is instantly gone

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.780 
big chunk of your DPS is instantly gone
as<00:00:48.140> well<00:00:48.320> as<00:00:48.500> many<00:00:48.830> other<00:00:49.130> of<00:00:49.370> your<00:00:49.489> powerful

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
as well as many other of your powerful

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.070 
as well as many other of your powerful
skills<00:00:50.410> with<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:51.559> change<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.580> means

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
skills with this change that means

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.450 
skills with this change that means
resilience<00:00:54.080> can<00:00:54.260> go<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.710> pet<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.100> with

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
resilience can go on the pet and with

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.640 
resilience can go on the pet and with
the<00:00:55.610> new<00:00:55.760> changes<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.300> resilience<00:00:56.720> also<00:00:57.350> where

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
the new changes to resilience also where

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.610 
the new changes to resilience also where
it<00:00:57.830> decreases<00:00:58.489> damage<00:00:58.940> as<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.180> whole<00:00:59.540> pets<00:01:00.260> have

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
it decreases damage as a whole pets have

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.150 
it decreases damage as a whole pets have
a<00:01:00.650> lot<00:01:00.920> better<00:01:01.220> survivability<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.890> terms<00:01:03.890> of

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
a lot better survivability in terms of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.270 
a lot better survivability in terms of
arenas<00:01:04.759> and<00:01:05.000> battlegrounds<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.080> also<00:01:06.800> this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
arenas and battlegrounds and also this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.830 
arenas and battlegrounds and also this
will<00:01:07.759> help<00:01:08.210> some<00:01:09.140> aspects<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.950> PvE<00:01:10.390> where<00:01:11.390> if

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
will help some aspects of PvE where if

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.120 
will help some aspects of PvE where if
the<00:01:12.410> mob<00:01:13.130> does<00:01:14.050> critical<00:01:15.050> damage<00:01:15.259> on<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.890> I

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
the mob does critical damage on to you I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.219 
the mob does critical damage on to you I
believe<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:16.759> also<00:01:17.030> decreases<00:01:17.750> some<00:01:17.869> damage

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
believe that also decreases some damage

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.440 
believe that also decreases some damage
of<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.470> as<00:01:18.649> well

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
of that as well

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.389 
of that as well
another<00:01:21.080> change<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.830> isn't<00:01:22.280> really

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
another change this isn't really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.810 
another change this isn't really
affecting<00:01:23.180> any<00:01:23.450> hunters<00:01:24.259> who<00:01:25.100> really<00:01:25.430> spec

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
affecting any hunters who really spec

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.490 
affecting any hunters who really spec
properly<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.310> if<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:29.600> have<00:01:29.869> any<00:01:30.110> spell

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
properly that is if you have any spell

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.260 
properly that is if you have any spell
penetration<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.729> will<00:01:31.910> go<00:01:32.060> directly

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
penetration that will go directly

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.890 
penetration that will go directly
towards<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.350> pet<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.100> only<00:01:34.370> pet<00:01:35.120> or<00:01:35.390> only

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
towards the pet now the only pet or only

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.140 
towards the pet now the only pet or only
pets<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.409> know<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.370> would<00:01:37.610> benefit

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
pets that I know of that would benefit

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.469 
pets that I know of that would benefit
from<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:38.540> would<00:01:39.170> probably<00:01:39.440> be<00:01:40.130> either<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
from this would probably be either the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.280 
from this would probably be either the
spirit<00:01:41.990> beast<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.830> chimera<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.870> dragon

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
spirit beast the chimera and the dragon

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.730 
spirit beast the chimera and the dragon
hawk<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.770> only<00:01:46.340> if<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.119> hunter<00:01:47.750> spects<00:01:48.380> into

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
hawk and only if the hunter spects into

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.580 
hawk and only if the hunter spects into
spell<00:01:49.040> penetration<00:01:49.729> which<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.330> don't<00:01:50.690> think

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
spell penetration which I don't think

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.029 
spell penetration which I don't think
really<00:01:52.310> would<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:54.020> aside<00:01:54.320> from<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.619> let's<00:01:54.859> go

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
really would so aside from that let's go

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.880 
really would so aside from that let's go
on<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.909> new<00:01:56.719> stuff<00:01:57.439> that<00:01:57.770> came<00:01:58.130> out

think<00:03:42.920> these<00:03:43.700> masters<00:03:44.270> will<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:46.820> very<00:03:47.000> well

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
think these masters will do very well

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.780 
think these masters will do very well
maybe<00:03:47.930> they'll<00:03:48.170> do<00:03:48.350> well<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.800> outdoor<00:03:49.280> but

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
maybe they'll do well in outdoor but

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.910 
maybe they'll do well in outdoor but
they<00:03:50.030> won't<00:03:50.330> do<00:03:50.540> very<00:03:50.570> well<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.770> next

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
they won't do very well and the next

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.990 
they won't do very well and the next
rate<00:03:52.250> because<00:03:53.210> they<00:03:53.780> don't<00:03:53.960> scale<00:03:54.380> very<00:03:54.410> well

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
rate because they don't scale very well

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.600 
rate because they don't scale very well
the<00:03:56.000> reason<00:03:56.330> for<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.830> if<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.010> see<00:03:58.220> some<00:03:58.430> high

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
the reason for that if you see some high

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.350 
the reason for that if you see some high

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
skill since arcane shot is so cheap in

mana nowadays and glyph a freezing trap
which<00:06:00.979> might<00:06:01.700> be<00:06:01.910> pretty<00:06:02.300> good<00:06:02.450> for<00:06:02.990> PvP<00:06:03.889> only

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
which might be pretty good for PvP only

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.600 
which might be pretty good for PvP only
where<00:06:05.320> it<00:06:06.320> will<00:06:07.090> reduce<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.590> victims<00:06:09.610> speed

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
where it will reduce the victims speed

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.330 
where it will reduce the victims speed
moving<00:06:10.970> speed<00:06:11.180> by<00:06:11.449> 30%<00:06:12.350> for<00:06:12.500> 4<00:06:12.710> seconds<00:06:13.160> when

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
moving speed by 30% for 4 seconds when

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.230 
moving speed by 30% for 4 seconds when
the<00:06:13.789> trap<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.120> broken

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
the trap is broken

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.760 
the trap is broken
and<00:06:15.930> so<00:06:16.590> these<00:06:17.130> are<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:18.060> changes<00:06:18.720> made<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.080> the
