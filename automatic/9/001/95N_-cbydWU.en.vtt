00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.620
 exact 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.180
 but 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.260
 the talk is accompanied by a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.400
 movement body gymnastics with 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.400
 double bass that 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 yes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.270
 those souls that you find out already only 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 it's pitchers to keep it in mind where the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 fears of sitting alone 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.020
 a neighbor will sell you now 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 how long have you been drinking 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.160
 well 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.160
 the last of 2012 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.120
 and a half or so 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.040
 the salt jug 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.890
 which regulates the whole body 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.090
 what is under the eyes and what is 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 uploaded it low 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.970
 and this is what he talks about 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.080
 the magnificent one of the 2010 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.650
 not because I said this 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.010
 go to believe that is true tell us 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.010
 the numbers 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.840
 the creatinine that I had 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.319
 to 72 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.070
 I think it's yes 78 and a half 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.500
 of age has dropped to 1 column 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.860
 the child does not cure the medicine for her 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.020
 it's just water be slow or be 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.280
 natural with the natural no longer empty 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.850
 to 40 to 140 of 78 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.850
 I 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.080
 and with and with the jar 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.080
 the left one by one 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.409
 the doctor the doctor when I saw moment 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.409
 because it is a medical header 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.130
 he saw that every ticket was very much going 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.350
 to be work 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.180
 the most that can be in the insurance 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.250
 with 30 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.040
 and I'm going to have her home 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.890
 well 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.500
 I covered myself when I had done another 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.520
 hospital visit 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.650
 from the pile of right foot 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.260
 while and in fact I already had the 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.200
 claws 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.200
 I start to drink and when I come the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.430
 First visit because they give you 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.060
 it really comes in handy 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.450
 a month I go with all my analytics that 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.560
 I had done 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.560
 and if I 'm not happy 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.320
 Y 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.320
 what 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.030
 for such date you come for the reality 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.700
 right 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.800
 you look at the analytics I had already been 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.709
 drinking water and when I come to 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.709
 doctor had her at one with 30 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.420
 he says he gives me two more months he was 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.600
 one month two months drinking water 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.600
 and when I get to him 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.900
 without telling me anything breaks the primer 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.830
 the primer says if you need another and 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:42.330
 other 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.860
 and always the same does not need the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.590
 canteen 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.590
 and how 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.680
 in cash or combined 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.680
 mind 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.630
 well I say as I am saying you are 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.360
 more audio 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.380
 island has this car 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.280
 and so yes 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280
 to 11 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.139
 why I where do I talk about the 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.620
 cart 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.009
 because this is going to come out of a 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.210
 in fact it is like this 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.650
 that already knows everything many times 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.810
 visiting sugar will visit us flares 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.550
 why 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.270
 the cholesterol because I have it very well 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.570
 I would say tared 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 I do not tell myself almost anything to eat before 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.050
 high 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.810
 take yourself 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:55.560
 and it's not any organization before and 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.990
 now when I remember a peaceful 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.860
 because the doctor lets the pin or 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.509
 they do not leave you the pill 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.509
 says the by mary body 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.729
 but I 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.590
 i 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:36.640
 but you had before more sugar if 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:42.160
 and my sister my mother died of sugar in 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.160
 24 years the diabetic 30 years 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:52.280
 and then it contained making diabetics 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:57.409
 it was clear what I do most in sailing 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:01.119
 in my work and also walk a lot 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:07.009
 I had ideas of what to do after 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:09.729
 work throw me to others 8 km 10 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.729
 kilometers according 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:17.449
 Well, if I have a moment of time 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.879
 some minutes or I do push-ups or 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:23.449
 gymnastics because I have all the machines 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:27.460
 of gymnastics in my house I make an element 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:32.479
 of the tape like the book or little good 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:35.270
 my body while remarkable to touch I think 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.810
 that is all pretty well explained and 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:44.409
 so just give you the decent speed and 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.409
 that some thanks to you thanks 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.789
 friends
