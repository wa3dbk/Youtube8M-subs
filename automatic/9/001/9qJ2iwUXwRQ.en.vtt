00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.229 
want to do the knock off I'll explain it
but<00:00:34.680> I'll<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.890> setting<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.760> quick

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
but I'll be setting up for the quick

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
but I'll be setting up for the quick
kill<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.680> ahead<00:00:38.719> first<00:00:39.719> off<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.620> needs<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
kill so go ahead first off this needs to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
kill so go ahead first off this needs to
switch<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> storm<00:00:42.590> that's<00:00:43.590> important

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
switch over to storm that's important

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
switch over to storm that's important
that's<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.329> important<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.410> needs<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that's very very important this needs to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
that's very very important this needs to
become<00:00:46.950> storm<00:00:48.110> that<00:00:49.110> could<00:00:49.260> stay<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
become storm that could stay this can it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.549 
become storm that could stay this can it
I<00:00:52.079> believe<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:52.980> stay<00:00:54.559> usually

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
I believe this can actually stay usually

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.970 
I believe this can actually stay usually
I<00:00:55.620> keep<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:57.320> what<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> salts<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I keep this one on what the salts I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
I keep this one on what the salts I
don't<00:00:59.820> think<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.090> matters<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
don't think it really matters but I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
don't think it really matters but I
think<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.219> own<00:01:02.340> sake<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:02.670> just

think just for my own sake also just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.149 
think just for my own sake also just
double<00:01:03.120> its<00:01:03.239> assaults<00:01:03.539> fleet<00:01:04.500> feet<00:01:04.680> because
