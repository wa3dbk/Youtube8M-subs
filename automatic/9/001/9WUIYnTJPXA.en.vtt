is<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.769> box<00:03:20.950> again<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.220> might<00:03:21.549> need<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.910> for

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
is the box again I might need it for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:33.170 
is the box again I might need it for
some<00:03:22.390> reference<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:25.410> take<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.560> tape<00:03:26.769> off

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.699 

oh<00:03:39.150> there<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.299> go

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
oh there we go

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.270 
oh there we go
cut<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.070> tape<00:03:42.340> off<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.500> slice<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:44.830> bubble

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
cut the tape off and slice the in bubble

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920 
cut the tape off and slice the in bubble
wrap<00:03:45.310> back<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:47.280> there's<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> bubble<00:03:48.670> wrap<00:03:48.930> we

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
wrap back and there's the bubble wrap we

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.310 
wrap back and there's the bubble wrap we
don't<00:03:50.110> need<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.890> some<00:03:51.370> soft<00:03:52.180> foam<00:03:52.480> don't

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
don't need that and some soft foam don't

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880 
don't need that and some soft foam don't
need<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.590> as<00:03:53.709> well<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.850> check<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.450> clock

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
need it as well so like check the clock

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.770 
need it as well so like check the clock
so<00:03:56.890> it's<00:03:57.190> made<00:03:57.459> as<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.360> see<00:03:58.480> here's<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
so it's made as you can see here's the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.199 
so it's made as you can see here's the
no<00:03:59.739> labeled<00:04:00.549> first<00:04:00.850> austria<00:04:01.420> focus<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:03.209> it's

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
no labeled first austria focus and it's

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.610 
no labeled first austria focus and it's
come<00:04:05.079> on<00:04:05.640> very

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.170 

so<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:11.740> made<00:04:11.890> by<00:04:12.040> first<00:04:12.400> ostrich<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so it's made by first ostrich is the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.240 
so it's made by first ostrich is the
label<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.500> only<00:04:14.620> thing<00:04:14.830> else<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
label and the only thing else in the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.840 
label and the only thing else in the
front<00:04:15.460> is<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:16.060> display<00:04:16.840> itself<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.760> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
front is the display itself so on the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.240 
front is the display itself so on the
bottom<00:04:19.030> we<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.930> nothing<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.890> from<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
bottom we have nothing but from the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.360 
bottom we have nothing but from the
battery<00:04:22.000> compartment<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.780> uses<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:24.160> just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
battery compartment and it uses and just

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.620 
battery compartment and it uses and just
tell<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:25.980> cr2032<00:04:27.090> batteries<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
tell you cr2032 batteries that the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.460 
tell you cr2032 batteries that the
little<00:04:28.990> ones<00:04:29.200> just<00:04:29.610> five<00:04:30.610> watts<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:32.260> show

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
little ones just five watts just show

interesting stuff so that on/off button

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.030 
interesting stuff so that on/off button
for<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.350> projection<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:43.450> some<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:44.530> know<00:04:44.650> I'm

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
for the projection and some you know I'm

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.170 
for the projection and some you know I'm
set<00:04:45.370> along<00:04:45.850> one<00:04:46.150> band<00:04:47.140> for<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> radio<00:04:48.040> if<00:04:48.970> no<00:04:49.150> I

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
set along one band for the radio if no I

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.820 
set along one band for the radio if no I
didn't<00:04:49.420> have<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.660> use<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:49.990> clock<00:04:50.230> yet<00:04:50.500> but

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
didn't have to use this clock yet but

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.050 
didn't have to use this clock yet but
you<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:51.670> flip<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.180> projection<00:04:53.050> 180<00:04:53.350> degrees

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
you can flip the projection 180 degrees

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.140 
you can flip the projection 180 degrees
here's<00:04:55.060> DST<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.230> year<00:04:56.790> for<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.850> way<00:04:57.970> you

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
here's DST and the year for the way you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.250 
here's DST and the year for the way you
warm<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.510> presume<00:04:59.070> it<00:05:00.070> says<00:05:00.280> mode<00:05:00.610> here<00:05:00.970> no<00:05:01.930> idea

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
warm I presume it says mode here no idea

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.800 
warm I presume it says mode here no idea
what<00:05:02.410> mode<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:03.520> has<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.510> snooze<00:05:04.780> button

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
what mode it has and the snooze button

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.650 
what mode it has and the snooze button
which<00:05:05.230> is<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.500> largest<00:05:05.830> one<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.390> course

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
which is the largest one and of course

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.620 
which is the largest one and of course
we<00:05:07.840> must<00:05:07.870> look<00:05:08.290> at<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.500> projection<00:05:09.570> how<00:05:10.570> do

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
we must look at the projection how do

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.860 
we must look at the projection how do
you<00:05:10.750> use<00:05:10.960> this<00:05:11.460> now<00:05:12.460> there<00:05:12.669> is<00:05:12.760> just<00:05:13.330> up<00:05:13.600> and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
you use this now there is just up and

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.110 
you use this now there is just up and
down<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:15.130> focus<00:05:15.669> wheel<00:05:15.910> here<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:18.120> folks

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
down and the focus wheel here so folks

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.270 
down and the focus wheel here so folks
seen<00:05:19.419> folks<00:05:19.840> closer<00:05:21.150> that's<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:24.130> go

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
seen folks closer that's that you go

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.280 
seen folks closer that's that you go
join<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.050> back<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:27.990> volume<00:05:28.990> up<00:05:29.110> and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
join it in the back and volume up and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.980 
join it in the back and volume up and
down<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.890> can<00:05:30.880> set<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.570> demon<00:05:31.990> Ohio<00:05:32.470> Auto<00:05:32.980> and

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
down you can set the demon Ohio Auto and

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.460 
down you can set the demon Ohio Auto and
he's<00:05:34.990> there<00:05:35.530> for<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:36.550> radio<00:05:36.820> tuning<00:05:37.440> so<00:05:38.440> I

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
he's there for the radio tuning so I

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.250 
he's there for the radio tuning so I
should<00:05:38.950> plug<00:05:39.250> this<00:05:39.460> in<00:05:39.730> but<00:05:40.030> since<00:05:40.810> I<00:05:40.960> have<00:05:41.080> no

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
should plug this in but since I have no

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.390 
should plug this in but since I have no
time<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.740> won't<00:05:42.270> so<00:05:43.270> on<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.650> says<00:05:44.830> this<00:05:45.100> has

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
time I won't so on and says this has

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.580 
time I won't so on and says this has
been<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.940> unboxing<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.750> again<00:05:47.500> FA<00:05:49.230> 2421<00:05:50.230> -
