00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
I'm a little bit disappointed on the

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.249 
I'm a little bit disappointed on the
packaging<00:07:07.060> because<00:07:07.210> all<00:07:07.599> of<00:07:07.630> the<00:07:07.810> powder<00:07:08.020> has

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
packaging because all of the powder has

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.950 
packaging because all of the powder has
risen<00:07:08.470> to<00:07:08.770> the<00:07:08.889> top<00:07:09.130> layer<00:07:09.729> you<00:07:10.240> know<00:07:10.360> and<00:07:10.659> you

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
risen to the top layer you know and you

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.870 
risen to the top layer you know and you
know<00:07:11.440> when<00:07:11.560> they<00:07:11.830> have<00:07:11.979> like<00:07:12.220> two<00:07:12.400> layers<00:07:12.610> and

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
know when they have like two layers and

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.730 
know when they have like two layers and
the<00:07:13.150> bottom<00:07:13.630> part<00:07:13.840> is<00:07:13.930> all<00:07:14.080> the<00:07:14.199> product<00:07:14.500> image

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
the bottom part is all the product image

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.499 
the bottom part is all the product image
and<00:07:14.919> then<00:07:15.370> there's<00:07:15.550> holes<00:07:15.819> in<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.150> second

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:16.509 
and then there's holes in the second

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.510 
and then there's holes in the second
layer<00:07:16.659> to<00:07:16.990> bring<00:07:17.169> it<00:07:17.289> to<00:07:17.620> bring<00:07:17.800> the<00:07:17.919> powder<00:07:18.130> up

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
layer to bring it to bring the powder up

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.189 
layer to bring it to bring the powder up
to<00:07:18.639> the<00:07:18.759> next<00:07:18.909> layer<00:07:19.120> well<00:07:19.780> all<00:07:19.930> of<00:07:20.139> the

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
to the next layer well all of the

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.600 
to the next layer well all of the
products<00:07:20.590> like<00:07:20.710> half<00:07:21.039> of<00:07:21.159> it<00:07:21.280> has<00:07:21.400> already

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
products like half of it has already

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.010 
products like half of it has already
come<00:07:21.969> up<00:07:22.090> to<00:07:22.180> the<00:07:22.270> top<00:07:22.449> which<00:07:22.629> is<00:07:22.750> really

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
come up to the top which is really

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.809 
come up to the top which is really
annoying<00:07:23.229> so<00:07:23.379> I<00:07:23.530> think<00:07:23.590> the<00:07:23.830> holes<00:07:24.039> are<00:07:24.400> a

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:24.819 
annoying so I think the holes are a

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.189 
annoying so I think the holes are a
little<00:07:24.940> bit<00:07:25.090> too<00:07:25.240> big<00:07:25.539> or<00:07:25.719> something<00:07:25.750> I<00:07:26.139> don't

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
little bit too big or something I don't
