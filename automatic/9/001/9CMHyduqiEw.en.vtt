00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello everyone is like back with me and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 today I wanted to offer you 3 hairstyles are 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.760
 really very simple to make and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.070
 I find the film really a lot 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 sparkling the ideal for summer then 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 I hope you like that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 may you produce maybe you do me 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.429
 to know in the comments if you do them and that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.619
 other at the end of the video I will leave you one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.989
 small review on a product that i 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.700
 was sent from a site is a plate 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 for hair with which I did among other things 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.340
 these in these islands you see 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 today and i like it and i don't like it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 some positive things other negative things 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.129
 it is therefore really peculiar 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.329
 I'll tell you more about it in detail on 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.719
 end of the video 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 now I leave you tutorials and see you 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.360
 then I start I 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.129
 simply made a ponytail 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 as you can see I cut a little 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.940
 front tuft so I go to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.609
 collect a very simple twist 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.339
 and the stop with hell you will need it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.380
 a handful of these classics 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.030
 transparent because I split the tail 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 in two strands an upper one 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 lower private pretty fast 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 because I realized in tea 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 thing that pretty much I'm out of the room 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 so I'll explain it but you will see it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 further on 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.049
 I make a mini tail in the upper tail 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 and then let us pass inside 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.790
 dividing it precisely in half the tail 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.400
 lower and so I continue 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
 now, however, surely I am just coming down 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 you will see the passage better with your hands 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 in fact we slow down for a moment and there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.090
 I show you see I do this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 mini tail with transparent elastic la 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.880
 I open the 2 with my fingers to do it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.100
 then pass the queue in the middle 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.159
 below then the lower part then 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.649
 obviously I tighten then you still see 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 I make this mini tail with the elastic 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.520
 transparent a couple of centimeters below 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.829
 and then off with your fingers so to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.610
 create a little hole and let us pass 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.349
 inside the tail that has passed underneath 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 previously and so then continuous 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.709
 let's say for the whole 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 for the whole length for the whole 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.610
 mass in fact continuous and here we go a 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.300
 little bit faster so the procedure 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.040
 it is always the same for all hair and 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.400
 then I go to finish closing the two flaps 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.140
 so let's say that they stay together in a 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 elastic dream one hundred 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.349
 now it goes a little bit to get him out 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.380
 extremes of the rapporteur to make sure 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.660
 that is a little bulky a little more than 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.340
 hutton cell that we like best because 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.349
 more volume a bit short, the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.180
 braid bit more than size and this is the 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.830
 very original second final result 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.630
 Now let's move on to the second one 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.360
 hairstyle and I was inspired for 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.030
 this one has a protagonist of the game 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.130
 of thrones the blonde with braids 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.220
 now I don't see the name anyway I go 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.780
 simply to make a braid 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.390
 attached to the head for all meetings 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.500
 so instead of braiding braids 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.019
 towards above 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.560
 the plot towards below, however, always the same 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.019
 same procedure and I collect hair 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.750
 I always gather more hair towards the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.209
 upper side so you see I do the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.730
 braid the moment he arrived at the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.660
 external limbo the one towards the regio 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.160
 towards the nape we say not towards the face 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.890
 I add other hair and so on 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.500
 I continue throughout the whole 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.230
 short braid until it came in half 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.290
 and the story more hair but rather 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.510
 I continue with the classic three-way interlacing 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 strands the only difference precisely vi 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.390
 I said that it goes from weaving strands 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.489
 towards below and not towards above I read the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.109
 all however not transparent elastic 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.600
 and then I do the exact same thing 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.380
 on the other side going then to the races 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.930
 23 cine in a tail on the back 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.390
 of the nape I now do the same same 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.380
 identical thing just below then a 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.650
 greece 3 intertwining towards below and 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.039
 adding more and more hair to the side 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.110
 upper then on the back side 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.270
 towards the nape and not towards the face 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.590
 as we usually do with the others 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.810
 hairstyles in three what I have you 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.240
 previously proposed and therefore 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.580
 I always continue like this for the whole 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.530
 length of greece always a 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.690
 half say just behind the ear e 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.669
 then I stop collecting more hair 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.669
 from the back and continuous like the weaving 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.690
 classic just going as I told you 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.370
 towards below and not towards above continuous 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.310
 so that plot for 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.620
 the whole length of the hair precisely 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.479
 of the lock we made e 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.250
 then I go to do the same course 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.460
 identical thing on the other side as I have 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.729
 done first I then read them in a tail 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.650
 at the back of the neck and then I go to 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.930
 dissolve these transparent elastic bands 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.610
 it is not so much they are attacked I go 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.710
 then to dissolve precisely by creating a 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.990
 codina then use precisely here is the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.030
 plate that was sent to me from this 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.340
 van wood site of which I just told you 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.560
 I will talk to you in a video separately 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.510
 because otherwise this lasted too long 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.880
 video and then we make a video 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.570
 hairstyle and a video review e 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.180
 this is precisely the hairstyle like 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.240
 appears at the end of the 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.770
 very pretty realization I like it 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.350
 much 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.419
 Now let's go for the third hairstyle 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.180
 to comb all hair well and 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.150
 I apply to you here I am doing a row 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.130
 laterally I comb everything well and then 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.950
 apply a bit of volumizing now I go to 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.660
 take 3 what looks great a lot 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.729
 more substantial than those we have taken 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.950
 previously for the two children 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.110
 small and therefore I take three what 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.300
 just beautiful pretty big and started to 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.479
 make a classic weave of a 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.180
 treccia a tre e so I start by passing 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.630
 the first flap in the middle the second 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.490
 still in the center and then just done the 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.360
 first weave I add more and more 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.470
 hair from both the front and the side 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.990
 back side 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.849
 so while we were adding hair before 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.280
 only from the back side 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:31.180
 now let's add hair from in exchange i 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.370
 sides so I get more hair as I go 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.340
 that I go down from the front side 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.500
 that from the back side see how like 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.780
 I'm doing the important thing here is that 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.030
 descend well with your hands 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.530
 every time you intertwine why 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.930
 otherwise maybe if you have hair 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.669
 long months intertwine in the end to me is 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.090
 happened I had to redo it because yes 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.070
 a node was created practically and therefore 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.729
 I advise you to come down, see 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.189
 hand in hand for 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.710
 keep your hair in place 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.050
 untangled and therefore so continuous for 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.849
 all the rest of the mass until 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.499
 did not come just below the ear in the 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.509
 my case because the hair is anyway 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.189
 quite long arrival below 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.139
 to the ear and therefore I do not collect then 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:16.249
 all hair up to that 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:18.770
 I practically create three unique things 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:20.059
 therefore from this moment on it will not have 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.680
 more need to add hair 

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:24.409
 because precisely I took them all we say 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.020
 I hope I explained myself well maybe 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.210
 images will help and then it is wide 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.819
 simply the braid to make in 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.849
 way of giving it anyway 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.339
 volume and to have a little more body than 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.349
 however we like it better is otherwise if 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.949
 you already have beautiful and voluminous hair 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:45.289
 too dishes like me will definitely be 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.879
 but this is already a beautiful volume 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:49.279
 it is a passage that you can juggle 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.689
 you if you want it a little thinner or a 

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:53.210
 little more chi ashton cell though 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:55.610
 according to me for this type of braid e 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.559
 nice to have the bulky then leave a 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.270
 bit of games out you can either leave 

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:02.029
 a somewhat more orderly effect then 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:05.689
 without letting out what is known instead 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:08.449
 let him do so precisely and then 

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:09.979
 nothing this is the final tanning io 

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:11.209
 I hope you enjoyed the video and there 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:14.949
 let's see with very little 

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.949
 review a kiss hello
