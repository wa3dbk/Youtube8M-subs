00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.460
 at the start of the training today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 was an applause for the three new ones 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 international memphis depay zaccaria 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 bakkali and santiago arias 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
 who debuted last week for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 their countries the netherlands belgium and colombia 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 and further times the all internationals 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 completely back in Eindhoven 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.039
 international fast but good 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 come back and have some debut 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.769
 made 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 yeah that's just a great moment for that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.410
 both players fall but that also applies 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.619
 in front of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 santiago arias has made your debut 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.670
 and I think that's already a very special one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 moments are for 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 for the players with jeroen sweet and karim 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 rekik did an excellent job of training 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 again with goalkeeper coach ruud hes and also 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 karim rekik appears on the way back 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.489
 both jeroen the whole can do things outside 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 do like karimi 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.890
 yes according to plan actually 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 expires and happy 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 the training sessions are a bit off with 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 him that's a good sign but like you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.789
 as one says beautiful football terms 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 groningen comes too early how those two 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 ya certainly know for sure next week 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.680
 I don't think it is a risk either 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 take both 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.530
 no there are it off and so worry that is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 really 100% fit for the sa before they 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.009
 and can also flow in and also 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 with it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.610
 I should be able to follow the rhythm of the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 games again so we do look 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 good to where it goes well with the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 an injury of such a park are a big one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.439
 worry about the injury of georgino 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 Wijnaldum it as more than to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.700
 was thought before 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.409
 yes , they demand longer and longer 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.790
 I also indicated that the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.270
 calculated that it should still be 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.159
 what 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.049
 which may take longer and has 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.369
 mainly to do with the fact that if you do 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.130
 as a player 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.560
 four five weeks actually out of the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 rotation is yes then you also need one 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 several weeks of training to get back up to standard 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.090
 to be connected and therefore how 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 the longer that period, the longer we will 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.130
 You also need to join the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.170
 to add a group and it will be 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.790
 normally some time cover to the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 This morning also Luciano Narsingh 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 at training that was logical 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.049
 He plays against young PSV tonight 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.239
 helmond sport 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.350
 but I think very well with special 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.570
 will train on time 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
 then does it mention that he too 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.960
 have the feeling that they can compete 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.900
 are going to play 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.640
 he does that calmly on building 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670
 from a helmet to 60 minutes with a 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 70 minutes I must not forget that he 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 has been out of circulation for eight nine months 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.370
 when you get back then think so too 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.580
 It is wise that you first have some 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.490
 plays at young psv before 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 you're at the highest level 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.030
 participate but it is certainly going very badly 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.350
 well with him we are happy with that 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.610
 then of course it's Sunday afternoon the 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.260
 away match against Groningen 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.300
 traditionally always difficult but 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.130
 psv usually comes with a good one 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.850
 result home to groningen yes 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.020
 it is a 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.180
 She's bothering for free so we have to 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.660
 ensure good team performance to get there 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.770
 good result this is the sunday 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.210
 but keep in mind a whole 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.260
 opportunistic team in its own 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.410
 stadium to 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.870
 to definitely sit on the agree 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.210
 in the team but they also want to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.100
 play football from backwards but that is 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.620
 something always in the teams and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.500
 groningen has been sitting and then with it 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.460
 home public years it will be one anyway 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.460
 nice trip
