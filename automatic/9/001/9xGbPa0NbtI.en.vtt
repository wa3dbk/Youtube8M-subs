focus<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.680> flexible<00:00:59.190> OLED<00:00:59.399> display

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
focus on this flexible OLED display

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
focus on this flexible OLED display
because<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.640> cool

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
because it's it's actually really cool

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
because it's it's actually really cool
it's<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.539> flexible<00:01:04.050> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.230> flexible<00:01:04.620> OLED

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's it's flexible it's a flexible OLED

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's it's flexible it's a flexible OLED
display<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.940> those<00:01:06.480> curved<00:01:07.050> TVs<00:01:07.560> as

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
display so they have those curved TVs as

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
display so they have those curved TVs as
well<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:08.670> special<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.090> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
well but something special about this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.170 
well but something special about this
display<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:10.979> curve<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
display is that it can actually curve on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.950 
display is that it can actually curve on
demand<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.009> it<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:15.150> curves<00:01:15.600> towards

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
demand so a it actually curves towards

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
demand so a it actually curves towards
you<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.920> set<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.490> flat<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.270> your

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you or you can set it to be flat on your

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
you or you can set it to be flat on your
demand<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.710> sure<00:01:19.829> exactly<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.579> works

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
demand I'm not sure exactly how it works

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310 
demand I'm not sure exactly how it works
maybe<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.600> sort<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.079> button

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
maybe it's just one sort of one button

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.819 
maybe it's just one sort of one button
and<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.790> automatically<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.780> curves<00:01:25.380> itself

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
and it automatically just curves itself

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.999 
and it automatically just curves itself
but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.720> futuristic<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.740> I'm

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but it's really futuristic and I'm

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
but it's really futuristic and I'm
surprised<00:01:29.520> something<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.420> even

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
surprised something like that was even

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.440 
surprised something like that was even
possible<00:01:30.780> until<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.009> keep<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> mind<00:01:33.270> it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
possible until now keep in mind it's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
possible until now keep in mind it's
still<00:01:33.689> prototype<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.649> LG<00:01:35.220> doesn't<00:01:35.520> really

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
still prototype so LG doesn't really

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.030 
still prototype so LG doesn't really
have<00:01:35.909> any<00:01:36.180> release<00:01:36.720> information<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.649> terms<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
have any release information in terms of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
have any release information in terms of
pricing<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.729> real<00:01:38.970> estate<00:01:39.110> availability

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
pricing or real estate availability

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.060 
pricing or real estate availability
however<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> production<00:01:43.770> right

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
however it is it is in production right

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
however it is it is in production right
now<00:01:44.250> LG<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.880> working<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:46.020> assuming

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
now LG is working on it and I'm assuming

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
now LG is working on it and I'm assuming
they're<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.219> releasing<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.969> at

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
they're going to be releasing this at

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
they're going to be releasing this at
some<00:01:48.390> point<00:01:48.719> I<00:01:49.259> wouldn't<00:01:49.920> keep<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.250> hopes<00:01:50.460> up

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
some point I wouldn't keep your hopes up

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
some point I wouldn't keep your hopes up
for<00:01:50.939> 2014<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.960> looks<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> something

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
for 2014 it looks like more of something

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
for 2014 it looks like more of something
that's<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.549> come<00:01:53.790> later<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.450> down<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> line

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that's gonna come later on down the line

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.100 
that's gonna come later on down the line
I<00:01:55.469> think<00:01:55.619> LG<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.520> showcasing<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.270> what

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
I think LG is just showcasing of what

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
I think LG is just showcasing of what
this<00:01:58.320> technology<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.369> their<00:01:59.579> technology

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this technology or what their technology

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.410 
this technology or what their technology
is<00:02:00.270> capable<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.280> terms<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> TV<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
is capable of but in terms of the TV it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.709 
is capable of but in terms of the TV it
looks<00:02:04.009> absolutely<00:02:05.009> fantastic<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:06.060> 4k<00:02:06.479> so

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
looks absolutely fantastic it's 4k so

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.130 
looks absolutely fantastic it's 4k so
you<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.140> nice<00:02:08.030> colors<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:09.930> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you get nice colors it's just well I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
you get nice colors it's just well I
guess<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.619> OLED<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
guess it's OLED and because of that you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.450 
guess it's OLED and because of that you
get<00:02:12.240> nice<00:02:12.630> colors<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.320> it's<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
get nice colors it's it's really the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.130 
get nice colors it's it's really the
blacks<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:15.090> actual<00:02:15.990> box

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
blacks are actual box

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.530

they're really deep you get bright

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.780 
they're really deep you get bright
colors<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.710> 4k<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
colors and then because of the 4k the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.360 
colors and then because of the 4k the
resolution<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:22.660> crisp<00:02:23.100> images<00:02:24.100> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
