motor so let's look at the following
three<00:02:53.900> applications<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.140> our<00:02:55.620> reverse<00:02:56.190> heat

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
three applications of our reverse heat

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.400 
three applications of our reverse heat
engine<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.150> let's<00:02:57.420> begin<00:02:57.660> with<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
engine and let's begin with the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.010 
engine and let's begin with the
refrigerator<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.020> refrigerators

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
refrigerator so refrigerators

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.970 
refrigerator so refrigerators
essentially<00:03:01.890> use<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.520> motor<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.720> pump<00:03:04.110> warm<00:03:04.650> air

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
essentially use a motor to pump warm air

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.330 
essentially use a motor to pump warm air
inside<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.970> fridge<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:06.990> outside<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.160> the

fridge<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.970> example<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.720> room<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.590> inside

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
fridge for example the room now inside

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
fridge for example the room now inside
the<00:03:11.520> fridge<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:12.210> are<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.870> lower<00:03:13.170> temperature

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the fridge we are at a lower temperature

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.160 
the fridge we are at a lower temperature
and<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.580> outside<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> fridge<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.960> room

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and the outside of the fridge the room

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.890 
and the outside of the fridge the room
is<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.950> higher<00:03:17.310> temperature<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.690> an

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
is at a higher temperature so an

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.130 
is at a higher temperature so an
electric<00:03:19.620> motor<00:03:19.950> does<00:03:20.310> work<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:21.209> pump<00:03:21.540> some<00:03:21.930> of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
electric motor does work to pump some of

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.460 
electric motor does work to pump some of
that<00:03:22.290> heat<00:03:22.680> inside<00:03:23.310> our<00:03:23.670> object<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.200> at

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that heat inside our object which is at

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.280 
that heat inside our object which is at
a<00:03:25.590> lower<00:03:25.860> temperature<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.300> outside<00:03:27.870> which

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
a lower temperature to the outside which

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.520 
a lower temperature to the outside which
is<00:03:28.320> at<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> higher<00:03:29.430> temperature<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:30.420> we<00:03:31.020> define

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
is at a higher temperature and we define

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.190 
is at a higher temperature and we define
something<00:03:32.100> called<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.910> coefficient<00:03:33.420> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
something called the coefficient of

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.400 
something called the coefficient of
performance<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:35.610> be<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> ratio<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
performance to be the ratio of the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.070 
performance to be the ratio of the
amount<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:38.070> heat<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.940> pumped<00:03:39.390> out<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.570> our

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
amount of heat that is pumped out of our

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.620 
amount of heat that is pumped out of our
fridge<00:03:40.520> divided<00:03:41.520> by<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.730> work<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.600> done

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
fridge divided by the work that is done

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.300 
fridge divided by the work that is done
by<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.560> motor<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.730> pump<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.690> heats<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.890> this

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
by the motor to pump that heats so this

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
by the motor to pump that heats so this
ratio<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:48.360> basically<00:03:49.170> or<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.530> basically<00:03:50.010> tells

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
ratio is basically or it basically tells

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.940 
ratio is basically or it basically tells
us<00:03:50.730> how<00:03:51.239> much<00:03:51.540> heat<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.080> fridge<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.620> pump

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950

person<00:03:53.940> given<00:03:54.420> unit<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.230> work<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:56.280> recall

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
person given unit of work now recall

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.620 
person given unit of work now recall
from<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.840> equation<00:03:58.620> work<00:03:59.160> plus<00:03:59.640> QL<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.360> equal

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
from this equation work plus QL is equal

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.160 
from this equation work plus QL is equal
to<00:04:01.230> Q<00:04:01.590> H<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.580> we<00:04:02.730> can<00:04:02.940> rearrange<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:03.780> equation

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
to Q H so we can rearrange this equation

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.150 
to Q H so we can rearrange this equation
and<00:04:04.770> we<00:04:04.980> get<00:04:05.220> work<00:04:05.550> as<00:04:05.820> equal<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.450> Q<00:04:06.780> H<00:04:07.020> minus<00:04:07.680> QL

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
and we get work as equal to Q H minus QL

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.449 
and we get work as equal to Q H minus QL
so<00:04:08.880> if<00:04:09.150> we<00:04:09.420> replace<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.110> work<00:04:10.350> with<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.890> we

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
so if we replace the work with this we

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.080 
so if we replace the work with this we
get<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.940> following<00:04:11.970> equation<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.709> the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
get the following equation so the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.640 
get the following equation so the
coefficient<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.239> performance<00:04:16.140> for<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
non-ideal system is equal to QL divided

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.150 
non-ideal system is equal to QL divided

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
equation so we simply replace the ql

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.210 
equation so we simply replace the ql
with<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.340> temperature<00:04:46.000> lo<00:04:46.210> +<00:04:46.510> qh<00:04:47.380> with<00:04:48.010> the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
with the temperature lo + qh with the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.909 
with the temperature lo + qh with the
temperature<00:04:48.820> hi<00:04:49.060> where<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.080> temperature<00:04:50.680> H

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
temperature hi where the temperature H

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.950 
temperature hi where the temperature H
is<00:04:51.280> simply<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:51.790> temperature<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.510> is<00:04:52.690> higher

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
is simply the temperature that is higher

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.070 
is simply the temperature that is higher
and<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.410> TL<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.520> Hilo<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.479> temperature

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and the TL is that Hilo the temperature

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.950 
and the TL is that Hilo the temperature
that<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.590> lower<00:04:56.979> so<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:58.210> equation<00:04:58.780> only

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
that is lower so this equation only

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.280 
that is lower so this equation only
works<00:04:59.410> for<00:05:00.130> an<00:05:00.220> ideal<00:05:00.760> system<00:05:01.210> now<00:05:01.810> let's<00:05:02.080> move

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
works for an ideal system now let's move

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.580 
works for an ideal system now let's move
on<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.030> air-conditioner<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
on to the air-conditioner the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.230 
on to the air-conditioner the
air-conditioner<00:05:05.590> pumps<00:05:06.070> warm<00:05:06.460> air<00:05:06.790> at<00:05:07.090> a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
air-conditioner pumps warm air at a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.650 
air-conditioner pumps warm air at a
lower<00:05:07.600> temperature<00:05:08.020> by<00:05:08.710> doing<00:05:09.160> work<00:05:09.400> and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
lower temperature by doing work and

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.909 
lower temperature by doing work and
discharging<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:11.169> heat<00:05:11.500> into<00:05:11.800> the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
discharging the heat into the

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.370 
discharging the heat into the
surroundings<00:05:12.700> which<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.600> at<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.960> higher

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
surroundings which is at a higher

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.070 
surroundings which is at a higher
temperature<00:05:14.410> so<00:05:15.400> let's<00:05:15.970> suppose<00:05:16.180> we<00:05:16.690> have<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
temperature so let's suppose we have the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.650 
temperature so let's suppose we have the
following<00:05:17.290> room<00:05:17.889> our<00:05:18.130> system<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.600> is

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
following room our system and this is

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.570 
following room our system and this is
our<00:05:19.990> air<00:05:20.289> conditioner<00:05:21.039> so<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.400> air

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
our air conditioner so the air

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.870 
our air conditioner so the air
conditioner<00:05:22.470> essentially<00:05:23.470> does<00:05:23.710> work<00:05:24.039> on<00:05:24.340> our

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
conditioner essentially does work on our

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.870 
conditioner essentially does work on our
system<00:05:25.600> on<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.020> room<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:27.070> takes<00:05:27.370> some<00:05:27.729> of

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
system on the room and it takes some of

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.290 
system on the room and it takes some of
that<00:05:28.060> heat<00:05:28.419> from<00:05:28.840> our<00:05:29.139> system<00:05:29.860> which<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.729> at<00:05:30.970> a

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
that heat from our system which is at a

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.840 
that heat from our system which is at a
lower<00:05:31.570> temperature<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.590> it<00:05:32.919> takes<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.460> heat

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
lower temperature and it takes that heat

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.750 
lower temperature and it takes that heat
and<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.210> pumps<00:05:34.479> it<00:05:34.720> outside<00:05:35.380> which<00:05:35.860> is<00:05:36.130> at<00:05:36.340> a

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
and it pumps it outside which is at a

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.260 
and it pumps it outside which is at a
higher<00:05:37.060> temperature<00:05:37.690> so<00:05:38.440> we<00:05:38.590> have<00:05:38.770> ql<00:05:39.490> +<00:05:39.760> work

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
higher temperature so we have ql + work

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.260 
higher temperature so we have ql + work
is<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:41.050> amount<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.740> energy<00:05:42.340> that<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:43.000> released

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
is the amount of energy that is released

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.020 
is the amount of energy that is released
into<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.380> surroundings<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.340> is<00:05:45.520> released

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
into the surroundings that is released

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.010 
into the surroundings that is released
into<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:47.590> place<00:05:48.400> where<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.240> temperature<00:05:49.840> is

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
into the place where the temperature is

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.650 
into the place where the temperature is
higher<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.800> finally<00:05:51.729> let's<00:05:52.060> look<00:05:52.389> at<00:05:52.599> the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
higher and finally let's look at the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.560 
higher and finally let's look at the
heat<00:05:53.139> pump<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.979> heat<00:05:54.310> pump<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.880> essentially<00:05:55.539> a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
heat pump the heat pump is essentially a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.650 
heat pump the heat pump is essentially a
device<00:05:55.960> that<00:05:56.740> is<00:05:56.950> used<00:05:56.979> to<00:05:57.580> warm<00:05:57.820> a<00:05:58.000> house<00:05:58.240> in

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
device that is used to warm a house in

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.610 
device that is used to warm a house in
the<00:05:58.900> winter<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.610> uses<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.820> motor<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.900> pump<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
the winter it uses a motor to pump the

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.510 
the winter it uses a motor to pump the
heat<00:06:03.010> given<00:06:03.580> by<00:06:03.910> ql<00:06:04.570> from<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.080> outside<00:06:05.830> which

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
heat given by ql from the outside which

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.060 
heat given by ql from the outside which
is<00:06:06.550> at<00:06:06.789> a<00:06:06.880> lower<00:06:07.150> temperature<00:06:07.620> into<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.770> house

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
is at a lower temperature into the house

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.940 
is at a lower temperature into the house
which<00:06:09.580> is<00:06:09.729> at<00:06:09.880> a<00:06:09.910> high<00:06:10.479> temperature<00:06:11.139> so<00:06:11.770> the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
which is at a high temperature so the

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.700 
which is at a high temperature so the
entire<00:06:12.280> premise<00:06:13.000> of<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.330> heat<00:06:13.660> pump<00:06:13.960> is<00:06:14.229> to

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
entire premise of a heat pump is to

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.640 
entire premise of a heat pump is to
bring<00:06:15.010> heat<00:06:15.460> into<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.479> house<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:17.200> warm<00:06:17.440> the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
bring heat into the house to warm the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.580 
bring heat into the house to warm the
house<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.669> if<00:06:18.970> this<00:06:19.180> is<00:06:19.389> our<00:06:19.599> house<00:06:19.900> and<00:06:20.289> this

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
house so if this is our house and this

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.640 
house so if this is our house and this
is<00:06:20.770> our<00:06:20.950> heat<00:06:21.310> pump<00:06:21.639> the<00:06:22.270> heat<00:06:22.630> pump<00:06:22.990> does<00:06:23.289> work

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
is our heat pump the heat pump does work

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270 
is our heat pump the heat pump does work
on<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.250> air<00:06:24.580> on<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.210> outside<00:06:25.650> bring<00:06:26.650> some<00:06:27.130> of

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
on the air on the outside bring some of

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.110 
on the air on the outside bring some of
that<00:06:27.340> energy<00:06:27.970> inside<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.530> house

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
that energy inside and so the house

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.420 
that energy inside and so the house
becomes<00:06:31.120> warmer<00:06:31.870> and<00:06:32.050> in<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.590> same<00:06:32.889> exact<00:06:33.310> way

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
becomes warmer and in the same exact way

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.839 
becomes warmer and in the same exact way
we<00:06:33.880> can<00:06:34.090> also<00:06:34.360> define<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:35.050> coefficient<00:06:36.039> of

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
we can also define the coefficient of

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.749 
we can also define the coefficient of
performance<00:06:37.169> for<00:06:38.169> a<00:06:38.200> heat<00:06:38.590> pump<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.219> be

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
performance for a heat pump to be

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.390 
performance for a heat pump to be
the<00:06:40.240> amount<00:06:40.629> of<00:06:40.930> energy<00:06:41.259> that<00:06:41.710> is<00:06:42.069> brought

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
the amount of energy that is brought

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.719 
the amount of energy that is brought
into<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:42.969> house<00:06:43.330> per<00:06:44.229> given<00:06:44.589> work<00:06:45.009> done<00:06:45.370> by

into the house per given work done by
that<00:06:46.120> heat<00:06:46.689> pump<00:06:47.020> so<00:06:47.289> how<00:06:47.830> much<00:06:48.159> heat<00:06:48.520> can<00:06:48.759> be

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:48.819 
that heat pump so how much heat can be
