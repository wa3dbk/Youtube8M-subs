yo what is up guys this is exotic
centenary<00:00:11.490> guys<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> double<00:00:12.330> nuclear<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
centenary guys a double nuclear on the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.039 
centenary guys a double nuclear on the
map<00:00:13.110> Plaza<00:00:13.410> using<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> 94<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.960> know

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
map Plaza using the a 94 and you know

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.840 
map Plaza using the a 94 and you know
plazas<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> map<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.430> don't<00:00:17.580> see

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
plazas the map that you really don't see

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.279 
plazas the map that you really don't see
on<00:00:17.970> youtube<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.330> much<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.140> pretty

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
on youtube that much so it's pretty

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.990 
on youtube that much so it's pretty
awesome<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.340> double<00:00:20.699> nuclear

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
awesome to see you know double nuclear

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.689 
awesome to see you know double nuclear
on<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.210> map<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.660> using<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> 94<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
on this map and using the a 94 which is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.570 
on this map and using the a 94 which is
a<00:00:23.730> really<00:00:24.240> great<00:00:24.449> assault<00:00:24.900> rifle<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
a really great assault rifle so for the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
a really great assault rifle so for the
first<00:00:26.730> nuclear<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.800> fast

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
first nuclear it's a really really fast

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
first nuclear it's a really really fast
nuclear<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> minute<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.779> 45

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
nuclear it's about a minute in like 45

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.740 
nuclear it's about a minute in like 45
seconds<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.940> fast<00:00:33.180> i<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.600> hope

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
seconds really really fast i really hope

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
seconds really really fast i really hope
you<00:00:33.870> guys<00:00:33.960> enjoy<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.410> i<00:00:34.649> mean<00:00:34.770> i<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:35.010> pretty

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you guys enjoy it i mean i was pretty

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.209 
you guys enjoy it i mean i was pretty
much<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> enemy<00:00:36.000> spawn<00:00:36.829> 24-7<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.950> mean<00:00:38.100> they

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
much in the enemy spawn 24-7 I mean they

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.100 
much in the enemy spawn 24-7 I mean they
kept<00:00:38.399> spawning<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.210> orbital<00:00:39.570> vsat<00:00:39.750> up

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
kept spawning I had my orbital vsat up

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
kept spawning I had my orbital vsat up
in<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.350> EMP<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:41.850> much<00:00:42.030> invisible

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in my EMP so I was pretty much invisible

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.270 
in my EMP so I was pretty much invisible
these<00:00:42.899> guys<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:43.530> clue<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
these guys had no clue that I was you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
these guys had no clue that I was you
know<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.579> front<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.149> behind<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.780> or

know in front of them or behind them or
you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.649> didn't<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.280> type

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you know they just didn't have any type

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.240 
you know they just didn't have any type
of<00:00:47.910> clue<00:00:48.300> where<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.160> know

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of clue where I was so I'm you know

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.189 
of clue where I was so I'm you know
that's<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.579> helped<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.899> quick

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that's what helped me out and one quick

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
that's what helped me out and one quick
tip<00:00:52.230> guys<00:00:52.680> I've<00:00:52.920> seen<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.550> YouTube<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
tip guys I've seen like on YouTube you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
tip guys I've seen like on YouTube you
know<00:00:54.270> people<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.110> nuclear's<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
know people going for nuclear's and you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
know people going for nuclear's and you
know<00:00:56.430> p<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.000> course<00:00:57.239> everyone<00:00:57.780> has<00:00:57.809> their<00:00:58.199> own

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
know p of course everyone has their own

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760 
know p of course everyone has their own
opinion<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:59.390> scorestreaks<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.629> people<00:01:01.530> say

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
opinion on scorestreaks so people say

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
opinion on scorestreaks so people say
that<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> best<00:01:02.399> score<00:01:02.699> streaks<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that the best score streaks to go for a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.859 
that the best score streaks to go for a
nuclear<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.799> using<00:01:05.250> UAV<00:01:05.700> counter<00:01:06.210> UAV<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
nuclear is using UAV counter UAV and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
nuclear is using UAV counter UAV and
visa<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.189> um<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.060> used<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.420> run<00:01:09.630> those

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
visa but um you know I used to run those

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
visa but um you know I used to run those
score<00:01:10.110> streaks<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.159> came<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> notice<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
score streaks and I came to notice that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
score streaks and I came to notice that
the<00:01:12.299> EMP<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:14.010> better<00:01:14.540> then<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.930> course<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the EMP is way better then of course is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
the EMP is way better then of course is
way<00:01:16.470> better<00:01:16.619> than<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> counter<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> know

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
way better than the counter but you know

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
way better than the counter but you know
it<00:01:17.909> takes<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.420> kills<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it takes way more kills to get but you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
it takes way more kills to get but you
know<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.880> best<00:01:21.299> score<00:01:21.630> streak<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
know you the best score streak to go for

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.410 
know you the best score streak to go for
a<00:01:22.409> nuclear<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> pretty<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.520> for

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a nuclear and this is pretty much for

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
a nuclear and this is pretty much for
everyone<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.140> opinion<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> vivir<00:01:26.460> set

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
everyone my opinion is you a vivir set

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
everyone my opinion is you a vivir set
and<00:01:26.909> EMP<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> reasoning<00:01:28.049> behind<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.470> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and EMP and the reasoning behind that is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.850 
and EMP and the reasoning behind that is
because<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> EMP<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:31.110> does<00:01:31.320> take<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> little

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
because the EMP it does take a little

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
because the EMP it does take a little
bit<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> v<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.390> probably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
bit more than the v set it's probably

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
bit more than the v set it's probably
like<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:35.009> kill<00:01:35.250> after<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> v

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like one more kill after you get the v

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840 
like one more kill after you get the v
set<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.040> by<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.280> i<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.549> i<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
set and by the way i think i get the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.190 
set and by the way i think i get the
nuclear<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> climb<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
nuclear right here when I climb up this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.219 
nuclear right here when I climb up this
this<00:01:40.650> roof<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.790> anyway<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.630> course<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this roof but anyway so of course you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
this roof but anyway so of course you
know<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> MP<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.860> harder<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know the MP is harder to get in the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
know the MP is harder to get in the
counter<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> MP<00:01:46.380> you're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
counter but once you get the MP you're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
counter but once you get the MP you're
pretty<00:01:47.100> much<00:01:47.250> invisible<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.060> enemy<00:01:48.390> does<00:01:48.600> not

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pretty much invisible the enemy does not

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
pretty much invisible the enemy does not
know<00:01:49.079> where<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> get

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
know where you are and right here I get

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.690 
know where you are and right here I get
the<00:01:50.460> nuclear<00:01:50.880> by<00:01:51.509> am<00:01:51.720> giving<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.140> nuclear<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the nuclear by am giving that nuclear so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840 
the nuclear by am giving that nuclear so
um<00:01:53.909> yeah<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.229> saying<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> EMP<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
um yeah so like I was saying the EMP of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
um yeah so like I was saying the EMP of
course<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.329> harder<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> counter

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
course is harder to get in the counter

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
course is harder to get in the counter
but<00:01:58.409> once<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.700> even

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
but once you get it which is not even

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
but once you get it which is not even
hard<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> visa<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.590> pretty

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
hard if you get the visa you're pretty

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
hard if you get the visa you're pretty
it's<00:02:02.340> pretty<00:02:02.399> easy<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> EMPs<00:02:03.540> like

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it's pretty easy to get the EMPs like

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
it's pretty easy to get the EMPs like
one<00:02:03.869> kill<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.320> said<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:05.219> kill<00:02:05.430> after<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
one kill like I said one kill after the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210 
one kill like I said one kill after the
V<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.229> invisible<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
V set you're pretty much invisible and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.029 
V set you're pretty much invisible and
you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> enemy<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:10.080> can't<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you know the enemy they can't see the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.910 
you know the enemy they can't see the
radar<00:02:11.629> pretty<00:02:12.629> much<00:02:12.810> their<00:02:13.050> whole<00:02:13.200> screen<00:02:13.590> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
radar pretty much their whole screen is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
radar pretty much their whole screen is
and<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.069> fuzzy<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:14.580> whatever<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.209> they're

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and a fuzzy or whatever and they're

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
and a fuzzy or whatever and they're
pretty<00:02:15.870> much<00:02:15.900> disoriented<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
pretty much disoriented you know so you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250 
pretty much disoriented you know so you
pretty<00:02:17.849> much<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.330> whole<00:02:18.750> advantage

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
pretty much have the whole advantage

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.490 
pretty much have the whole advantage
over<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.620> enemy<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.810> yeah<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.319> guys

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
over the enemy and yeah so if you guys

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500 
over the enemy and yeah so if you guys
are<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.190> know<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.489> for<00:02:23.700> nuclear's<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.420> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
are you know going for nuclear's and you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.010 
are you know going for nuclear's and you
guys<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.140> UAV<00:02:26.010> counter<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.730> v<00:02:26.910> set<00:02:27.209> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
guys think that UAV counter and v set is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.729 
guys think that UAV counter and v set is
the<00:02:28.260> best<00:02:28.500> way<00:02:28.849> try<00:02:29.849> UAV<00:02:30.390> v<00:02:30.900> set<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.470> EMP

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the best way try UAV v set and EMP

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.070 
the best way try UAV v set and EMP
because<00:02:32.340> i<00:02:32.520> know<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:32.880> i<00:02:33.060> get<00:02:33.120> impede<00:02:33.810> i

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
because i know when i get impede i

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.650 
because i know when i get impede i
pretty<00:02:34.650> much<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:35.250> kind<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.850> give<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
pretty much like kind of give up on the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.930 
pretty much like kind of give up on the
game<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.520> gonna<00:02:38.640> say

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
game like I just like I'm not gonna say

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.440 
game like I just like I'm not gonna say
I<00:02:38.970> stopped<00:02:39.450> trying<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.980> lose<00:02:41.790> interest<00:02:42.269> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
I stopped trying but I lose interest in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.059 
I stopped trying but I lose interest in
the<00:02:42.540> game<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.260> oh<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:43.620> god<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:43.890> is

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
the game like I'm like oh my god this is

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.070 
the game like I'm like oh my god this is
you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.300> might<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.870> be

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you know I don't know it might just be

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.710 
you know I don't know it might just be
me<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.470> when<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> get<00:02:47.640> EMP<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.630> just

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
me but when I get EMP I just I just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.720 
me but when I get EMP I just I just
stopped<00:02:49.230> trying<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.680> guess<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.130> don't<00:02:50.459> know<00:02:50.550> it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
stopped trying I guess I don't know it's

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.059 
stopped trying I guess I don't know it's
just<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.150> lose<00:02:51.600> motivation<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> game<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
just I lose motivation in the game and I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.940 
just I lose motivation in the game and I
kind<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.180> might<00:02:55.080> leave<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.530> game<00:02:55.769> even

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
kind of just I might leave the game even

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.800 
kind of just I might leave the game even
because<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.819> know<00:02:56.850> EMP<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.450> pretty

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
because it's you know EMP is pretty

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.860 
because it's you know EMP is pretty
pretty<00:02:58.769> annoying<00:02:59.069> in<00:02:59.280> my<00:02:59.430> opinion<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.000> yeah

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
pretty annoying in my opinion and yeah

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.240 
pretty annoying in my opinion and yeah
so<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.230> guys<00:03:01.350> are<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.739> nuclear's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so if you guys are going for nuclear's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.009 
so if you guys are going for nuclear's
if<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> guys<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> youtube<00:03:03.480> channel<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
if you guys have a youtube channel and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.590 
if you guys have a youtube channel and
you<00:03:04.110> guys<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:05.130> going<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.549> nuclear's<00:03:05.970> why

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you guys like going for nuclear's why

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.509 
you guys like going for nuclear's why
not<00:03:06.810> try<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.140> scorestreak<00:03:07.920> set<00:03:08.100> up<00:03:08.220> who

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
not try this scorestreak set up who

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.430 
not try this scorestreak set up who
knows<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.330> get<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> double<00:03:09.840> nuclear<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
knows you can get a double nuclear you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.250 
knows you can get a double nuclear you
can<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> super-fast<00:03:11.400> nuclear<00:03:11.880> or<00:03:12.150> um<00:03:12.810> you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
can get a super-fast nuclear or um you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.949 
can get a super-fast nuclear or um you
know<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.560> yeah<00:03:14.069> man<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.540> said<00:03:15.600> one

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
know just yeah man so like I said one

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.390 
know just yeah man so like I said one
more<00:03:16.080> time<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.650> those<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.160> for

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
more time for those of you going for

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.670 
more time for those of you going for
nuclear's<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.390> my<00:03:18.660> opinion<00:03:18.959> hands<00:03:19.590> down<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
nuclear's in my opinion hands down the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.069 
nuclear's in my opinion hands down the
UAV<00:03:22.680> V<00:03:22.890> set<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.340> EMP<00:03:23.640> scorestreaks<00:03:24.600> setup<00:03:24.930> is

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
up dying but I do get the nuclear

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.909 
up dying but I do get the nuclear
watching<00:04:36.539> I'm<00:04:36.629> just<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:37.409> forth<00:04:37.469> behind

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
that was my nuclear care i'll turn

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.980 
that was my nuclear care i'll turn
around<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.330> know<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.569> guy<00:04:42.689> spawn

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
behind me but i do get the nuclear right

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.429 
behind me but i do get the nuclear right
here<00:04:45.389> as<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:45.569> guys<00:04:45.689> can<00:04:45.870> see<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.139> metals

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
here as you guys can see the metals

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.399 
here as you guys can see the metals
headshot<00:04:46.979> survivor<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.000> then<00:04:48.539> bam<00:04:48.930> give<00:04:49.349> me

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
headshot survivor and then bam give me

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.010 
headshot survivor and then bam give me
that<00:04:49.500> nuclear<00:04:49.949> so<00:04:50.729> that's<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.389> double<00:04:51.569> nuclear

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
that nuclear so that's a double nuclear
