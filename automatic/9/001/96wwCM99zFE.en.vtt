00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
still very successful but maybe when we

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.090 
still very successful but maybe when we
start<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.620> players<00:00:49.860> are

taking people out silent you know and I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.890 
taking people out silent you know and I
think<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.310> would<00:03:10.400> be<00:03:10.489> really<00:03:10.640> cool<00:03:10.910> because<00:03:11.150> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
think it would be really cool because it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.210 
think it would be really cool because it
would<00:03:12.049> kind<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.350> be<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.709> mixture<00:03:13.130> of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
would kind of be like a mixture of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.069 
would kind of be like a mixture of
splinter<00:03:13.700> cell<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.090> cold<00:03:14.359> duty<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.840> mean

splinter cell and cold duty I mean

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.210 
splinter cell and cold duty I mean
that's<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:15.470> me<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.650> think<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.100> would<00:03:16.160> be

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
that's just me I think that would be

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.849 
that's just me I think that would be
really<00:03:16.310> cool<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:17.030> brand<00:03:17.660> new<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.590> course

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
really cool and brand new but of course

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.620 
really cool and brand new but of course
