necessarily<00:00:30.699> providing<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.659> error<00:00:32.200> correction

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
necessarily providing a error correction

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.060

in<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.890> form<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.370> what<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.120> white<00:00:34.329> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
in the form of what is it white and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.560 
in the form of what is it white and
provided<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.160> koi<00:00:36.340> problem<00:00:36.580> what<00:00:37.240> we<00:00:37.360> found

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
provided the koi problem what we found

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060 
provided the koi problem what we found
that<00:00:37.750> works<00:00:37.960> pretty<00:00:38.110> well<00:00:38.260> is<00:00:38.620> we<00:00:38.770> just<00:00:38.920> keep

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
that works pretty well is we just keep

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.290 
that works pretty well is we just keep
presenting<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.640> until<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:39.970> get<00:00:40.150> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
presenting it until we get the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.900 
presenting it until we get the
changeover<00:00:41.050> now<00:00:41.380> it<00:00:41.530> may<00:00:41.710> affect<00:00:41.890> appear<00:00:42.730> that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
changeover now it may affect appear that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.850 
changeover now it may affect appear that
it<00:00:42.970> could<00:00:43.210> shape<00:00:43.630> up<00:00:43.810> guess<00:00:44.110> into<00:00:44.500> something

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
it could shape up guess into something

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.140 
it could shape up guess into something
dirty<00:00:44.980> we<00:00:45.190> haven't<00:00:45.460> found<00:00:45.580> that<00:00:45.790> to<00:00:45.910> be<00:00:45.940> the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
dirty we haven't found that to be the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.960 
dirty we haven't found that to be the
case<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.620> here's<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:48.220> white<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.550> reason<00:00:48.820> why

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
case and here's the white the reason why

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.060 
case and here's the white the reason why
I<00:00:49.000> have<00:00:49.870> kind<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.260> thought<00:00:50.470> about<00:00:50.560> doing<00:00:50.830> it

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
I have kind of thought about doing it

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.060 
I have kind of thought about doing it
this<00:00:51.190> way<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.380> fact<00:00:53.740> that<00:00:53.890> the

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
this way is the is the fact that the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.520 
this way is the is the fact that the
responses<00:00:54.730> are<00:00:54.910> in<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.120> repertoire<00:00:55.720> in<00:00:56.290> other

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
responses are in the repertoire in other

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590 
responses are in the repertoire in other
words<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.280> name<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.880> color<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.300> both

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
words the the name and the color of both

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.120 
words the the name and the color of both
in<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.840> child's<00:00:59.170> repertoire<00:00:59.650> where<00:00:59.860> we<00:00:59.980> would

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
in the child's repertoire where we would

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.010 
in the child's repertoire where we would
have<00:01:00.310> would<00:01:01.210> have<00:01:01.240> moved<00:01:01.540> in<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:01.870> particular

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
have would have moved in this particular

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.380 
have would have moved in this particular
direction<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.430> they're<00:01:03.610> very<00:01:03.880> strong

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
direction so they're very strong

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.020 
direction so they're very strong
responses<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.650> repertoire<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:06.880> have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
responses in the repertoire and I have

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.660 
responses in the repertoire and I have
found<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.780> those<00:01:08.409> cases<00:01:08.829> sometimes<00:01:09.280> you

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
found that in those cases sometimes you

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.039 
found that in those cases sometimes you
may<00:01:09.850> make<00:01:10.060> somebody<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.479> little<00:01:10.689> bit<00:01:10.780> prompt

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
may make somebody a little bit prompt

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.590 
may make somebody a little bit prompt
depending<00:01:11.560> on<00:01:11.859> traffic<00:01:12.189> so<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.939> just<00:01:13.420> keep

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
depending on traffic so I just keep

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.899 
depending on traffic so I just keep
going<00:01:13.929> plus<00:01:14.319> they've<00:01:14.560> also<00:01:14.770> sets<00:01:15.219> up<00:01:15.429> a<00:01:15.670> little

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
going plus they've also sets up a little

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.300 
going plus they've also sets up a little
negative<00:01:16.090> reinforcement<00:01:16.869> paradigm<00:01:17.319> where

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
negative reinforcement paradigm where

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.760 
negative reinforcement paradigm where
you<00:01:19.060> don't<00:01:19.240> move<00:01:19.479> on<00:01:19.749> until<00:01:20.139> you<00:01:20.439> get<00:01:20.619> it<00:01:20.740> right

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
you don't move on until you get it right

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.010 
you don't move on until you get it right
which<00:01:21.579> provides<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:22.119> little<00:01:22.270> incentive<00:01:22.689> for

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
which provides a little incentive for

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.010 
which provides a little incentive for
getting<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.850> moving<00:01:24.850> on<00:01:25.119> would<00:01:25.359> act<00:01:25.539> as<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.719> form

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
getting it moving on would act as a form

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.649 
getting it moving on would act as a form
of<00:01:26.109> reinforcement<00:01:26.829> and<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.039> usually<00:01:27.189> does

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
of reinforcement and it usually does

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.550 
of reinforcement and it usually does
because<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:28.749> ultimately<00:01:28.869> leads<00:01:29.350> you

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
because it ultimately leads you

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.739 
because it ultimately leads you
reinforcer<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.639> sets<00:01:30.999> up<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.329> little<00:01:31.569> bit

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
reinforcer it sets up a little bit

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.480 
reinforcer it sets up a little bit
negative<00:01:32.020> reinforcement<00:01:32.799> paradigm<00:01:33.189> it's<00:01:33.399> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
negative reinforcement paradigm it's a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.160 
negative reinforcement paradigm it's a
person<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.999> be<00:01:34.119> wrong<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.749> doesn't<00:01:35.020> keep<00:01:35.109> me

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
person to be wrong you doesn't keep me

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.199 
person to be wrong you doesn't keep me
ask<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.619> same<00:01:35.799> question<00:01:35.829> over<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.520> over<00:01:36.639> now

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
ask the same question over and over now

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.149 
ask the same question over and over now
I<00:01:37.240> don't<00:01:37.450> suggest<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.200> many<00:01:38.619> kids<00:01:38.889> no

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
I don't suggest that many kids no

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.129 
I don't suggest that many kids no
invisible<00:01:39.429> accepting<00:01:40.329> more<00:01:40.479> advanced<00:01:40.840> kids

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
invisible accepting more advanced kids

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.599 
invisible accepting more advanced kids
because<00:01:41.649> they<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.950> lots<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.280> problem

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
because they get lots of problem

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.300 
because they get lots of problem
behavior<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.929> get<00:01:44.139> all<00:01:44.229> kind<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.799> all<00:01:45.039> kinds

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
behavior and get all kind of a all kinds

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.800 
behavior and get all kind of a all kinds
of<00:01:45.369> problem<00:01:45.700> behavior<00:01:45.819> at<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.359> point<00:01:46.630> if

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
of problem behavior at that point if

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.029 
of problem behavior at that point if
you're<00:01:46.959> not<00:01:47.049> careful<00:01:47.319> with<00:01:47.619> that<00:01:47.649> sort<00:01:48.009> of

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
something I found that to work a little

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.679 
something I found that to work a little
better<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.770> mean<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.670> guess<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.450> know<00:02:02.539> it's

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
better I mean I I guess you know it's

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.170 
better I mean I I guess you know it's
open<00:02:02.990> for<00:02:03.289> some<00:02:03.649> empirical<00:02:04.009> more<00:02:04.670> honorable

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
open for some empirical more honorable

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.959 
open for some empirical more honorable
support<00:02:05.570> but<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.869> seems<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.649> me<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.579> works<00:02:07.820> a

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
support but it seems to me it works a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.869 
support but it seems to me it works a
little<00:02:08.060> bit<00:02:08.269> little<00:02:08.780> bit<00:02:08.869> better<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.890> let's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879
