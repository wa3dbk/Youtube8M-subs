older<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.590> doesn't<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.580> thing

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

that<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.630> me<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.260> younger<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
that I did for me when I was younger I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.770 
that I did for me when I was younger I
think<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> main<00:01:11.909> problems<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.600> had

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
think one of the main problems I had

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.010 
think one of the main problems I had
with<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.189> he<00:01:14.970> defined<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
with it was that he defined a lot of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
with it was that he defined a lot of
words<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.009> helped<00:01:17.220> me<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
words which really helped me when I was

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.219 
words which really helped me when I was
younger<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.299> example<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
younger an example of this is on the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.499

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
nerves I just ended up skipping the
portions<00:01:42.689> where<00:01:42.960> he<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.350> define<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> words

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
portions where he would define the words

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
portions where he would define the words
also<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.060> wasn't<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> lot<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> story<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
also there wasn't a lot of story in this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
also there wasn't a lot of story in this
book<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.100> makes<00:01:47.399> sense<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.240> only

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
book which makes sense because it's only

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
book which makes sense because it's only
165<00:01:49.439> pages<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.700> why<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> was

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
expecting so much story in such a little

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249

book<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:54.240> big<00:01:54.390> thought<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.229> lot
