00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
the in the gutters and you can't really

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
the in the gutters and you can't really
hit<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> bad<00:00:51.570> note<00:00:51.899> almost<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> play<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
hit a bad note almost when you play a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
hit a bad note almost when you play a
chord<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.420> note<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> sing<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
chord the note you have to sing is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.889 
chord the note you have to sing is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
encompassed in that chord but with bass

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
encompassed in that chord but with bass
it's<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> two-dimensional<00:00:59.730> drawing

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's more like a two-dimensional drawing

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's more like a two-dimensional drawing
as<00:01:00.329> opposed<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> three-dimensional

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
as opposed to a three-dimensional

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
as opposed to a three-dimensional
drawing<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.719> going

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
drawing where you have have this going

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.980 
drawing where you have have this going
on<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.250> ever<00:01:06.090> playing<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.780> sing

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on and you're not ever playing or sing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
on and you're not ever playing or sing

1
two<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.200> three<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:51.649> four<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:52.280> have<00:01:52.310> these

two and three and four and we have these
eighth<00:01:52.729> notes<00:01:53.030> going<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.770> basically<00:01:55.189> it's

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
eighth notes going on so basically it's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.730 
eighth notes going on so basically it's
like<00:01:55.460> tapping<00:01:55.759> your<00:01:56.090> foot<00:01:56.299> one<00:01:56.600> two<00:01:57.140> three

same time and which notes hit in the
spaces<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.560> want<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.889> do<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.129> same<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.489> your

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
spaces you want to do the same with your

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.759 
spaces you want to do the same with your
singing<00:04:02.849> so<00:04:03.659> if<00:04:03.780> there's<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.989> bass<00:04:04.260> part<00:04:04.590> that

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
