this under 20 seconds 20 seconds
guaranteed<00:01:15.810> Wow<00:01:16.170> took<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.740> longer<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.100> mix

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
guaranteed Wow took me longer to mix

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
guaranteed Wow took me longer to mix
this<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> play<00:01:18.869> behind<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.200> back
