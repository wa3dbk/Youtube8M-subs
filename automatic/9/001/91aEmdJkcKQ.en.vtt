bumpers<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.000> guess<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.450> wasn't

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
bumpers I guess it really wasn't

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
bumpers I guess it really wasn't
necessary<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.680> did<00:01:07.890> anyway<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.400> good

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
necessary but we did anyway for good

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
necessary but we did anyway for good
measure<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.060> green<00:01:09.330> ones<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> top<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.470> then

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
measure two green ones the top and then

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.270 
measure two green ones the top and then
white<00:01:10.830> LEDs<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.119> rest<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> playfield<00:01:13.280> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
white LEDs the rest of the playfield the

white LEDs the rest of the playfield the
back<00:01:15.030> glass<00:01:15.300> was<00:01:15.660> got<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.440> touch-up

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
back glass was got a little touch-up

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.050 
back glass was got a little touch-up
it's<00:01:17.970> uh<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> tough<00:01:19.140> glass<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:20.820> was

it's uh this is a tough glass this was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.680 
it's uh this is a tough glass this was
sealed<00:01:21.480> I<00:01:22.550> painted<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.730> sealed<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.510> not

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
sealed I painted and sealed actually not

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.470 
sealed I painted and sealed actually not
by<00:01:24.900> us<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.550> touched<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.330> got

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
by us so this was touched up when we got

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.360 
by us so this was touched up when we got
the<00:01:27.630> machine<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:28.980> did<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.190> pretty

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
the machine in and they did a pretty

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.100 
the machine in and they did a pretty
good<00:01:29.640> job<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.030> color<00:01:30.300> matched<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.870> pretty

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
good job they color matched it pretty

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
good job they color matched it pretty
well<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:33.120> know<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.480> we'll

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
well this can be I don't know if we'll

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
well this can be I don't know if we'll
ever<00:01:33.690> put<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> back<00:01:34.410> into<00:01:34.710> production<00:01:35.040> again

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
ever put this back into production again

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
ever put this back into production again
but<00:01:35.610> we've<00:01:35.730> color-coded<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
but we've color-coded you'll see when I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
but we've color-coded you'll see when I
put<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:39.300> red<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> blue<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
put it back in the red and blue and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.370 
put it back in the red and blue and
white<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.980> matches<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
white and it matches up pretty well the

back the soundboard has three new
capacitors<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.490> running<00:01:47.760> really<00:01:48.030> good

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
capacitors that's running really good

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.100 
capacitors that's running really good
all<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.250> displays<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.520> been<00:01:50.640> reheated
