00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.309
 beauty video if i'm testing what 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 autofocus that will be heard 3 5 this 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.299
 all of the fox 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 let's see how to work today 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.380
 show and tell 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 have a haiku biogel once it if you haven't 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.650
 have seen 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.830
 if you haven't used it yet 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 it will be really interesting because 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.340
 two months ago I ordered myself a4 and o 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.070
 gels now show here in these shades 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.829
 these are all shades or 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.520
 eggs of wild birds and if translated to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 Russian 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.789
 I was surprised that it was Russian 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 production is really Russian varnishes 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.649
 that is, I had a problem so that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 find them and order me these four 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.170
 shade brought sister nsa that his 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.940
 thanks and now i'm sorry i don't 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.579
 said more because two months I 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.800
 I only use these four 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.960
 biogel by them 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 no basecoats any top 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.869
 coatings holding it somewhere around two 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.189
 weeks ie 10 days if not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.920
 still some active work will think about 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 which is related to what you wash 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 dishes still something that is what that goes 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.090
 action on this biogel then he 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.009
 really keeps there until two and even if 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 some household work doing this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.450
 here there are five six days that's for sure 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.549
 there is really very long holding 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.710
 basic coverage is not necessary because 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.150
 there are substances that penetrate 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.689
 elbow and they strengthen and nourish and not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.130
 works with my nails now Cyprus 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.350
 white-white very strong and can not 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 say they grow faster but they 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.530
 all walls are really stronger 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.320
 I have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 from this carry the eggs of wild birds to me 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 It seems to be a great match. 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 because they have such everywhere 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.290
 here are small patches here these points 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.430
 I think they are 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.100
 the advice here is this feeling after all this 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.380
 single series is your article 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.500
 in general, to be honest, I first bought 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.720
 just this original external 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.950
 kind of and only then learned that it 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.800
 really works very cool for 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.080
 nails and really it is very fast and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.610
 very simple and do not need to change so often 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.160
 lac thousand and it really keeps very 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.110
 long a very cool thing and what else 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.030
 wanted to show you the connection with nails so 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.340
 the thing is vod-ok nail polish remover 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 even if you want to feel 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.420
 any difference before just buy 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.940
 some kind of professional life up 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.280
 removing varnish here for example api and it's throat 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.720
 some other brands that do 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.820
 precisely nail polishes and all that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.830
 need for nail care ie 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.730
 the difference is simply huge 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.550
 like heaven and earth 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 This is a gift from my girlfriend for what 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.590
 thank you so much really very cool 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.230
 try it and you just see the difference in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.750
 compared with some cheap 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.750
 means despite the fact that the expense of him 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.750
 compare more will be less than that of more 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.100
 cheap analogues because not so 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 quickly disappears I do not know for some reason 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.050
 they are spent as it is more needed 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.120
 more you and more of this means 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.530
 despite being cheap to me 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.790
 it seems that everything is not very convenient 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.910
 one more thing 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.860
 this is oil from orly 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.570
 I think we have 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.290
 and for some reason I spend very much 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.840
 economically effect every manicure i have it 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.770
 using and really for some reason I have it 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.050
 ends still lasts and lasts it 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.220
 all the cool things that i tell you 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.850
 show maybe something was 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.780
 I wonder if you have any experience 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.300
 communicating with people for you stupid something 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.280
 new with them yes i mean you can something 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.650
