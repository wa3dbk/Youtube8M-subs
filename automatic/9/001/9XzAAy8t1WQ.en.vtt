00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.149
 I already finished 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.710
 made 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.030
 otherwise cooking videos should be that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.840
 is exactly all clear here 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.160

 Take a look at the ingredients today 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.059
 I need today at the fall I want 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.800
 namely a nice soup and cook 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.299
 for that we need the following I know 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.909
 Not because of the amount so I guess 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.219
 I'll drop you off while watching a video 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.049
 someday explain and indeed need 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.289
 I need potatoes 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.899
 it's best if you take it mealy 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.329
 boiling onions all over the bunch 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.529
 fresh garlic bought here now 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.630
 then we need to be so beat here 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:27.749
 I have a lot later bread 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.069
 bought that then just look 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:33.279
 heaps of apologies I'm totally 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.979
 Ill belong to heaps of carrots 

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.179
 So here's 1000 grams in there 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.270
 I do not think much used 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.609
 always watch meat broth and I cook 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.479
 ever a whole liter of hot 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.679
 water on later for the cooking pot then 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.929
 here to the spices 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.929
 Today we need his hit like 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.099
 always some nutmeg preferably also 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.829
 freshly grated I have too 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.299
 some do not ask me where now 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.049
 lemon measure fresh lemons I have 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.359
 Of course not 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.749
 I'm totally about practical human 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.369
 then here chives and what I have now 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:09.970
 we forgot about it soon 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.370
 came a bit chili so i got mine 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.180
 two of these dice purely done a 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.500
 hot water boiled up 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
 there is now only here purely lets 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.760
 dissolve by itself 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.959
 The glasses need for later 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.280
 to deglaze such a big chunk of butter 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.950
 normal mother 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.049
 and let yourself in the big dog 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.719
 pot do not melt in the middle of dismissed 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.700
 Renault to go so close a snap 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.230
 you a garlic clove I'm kidding 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.730
 Of course, forgetting that this way 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.469
 individual things are the whole thing 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.859
 trimmed because that makes now please 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.079
 not by cutting the whole one 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.700
 small it will be repaired and again 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.669
 then you try with a knife so 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.069
 bit against it then comes 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.810
 they very whole juice then another one 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.870
 a bit out and soon 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.659
 in the pot so all these things 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.900
 out of the coalition because they are the whole 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.790
 Room under touch that they in 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.750
 salander case better said and a lot 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.409
 say off because that's very important now 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.150
 maybe you can also a pinch 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.359
 To go sugar then the whole thing will be 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.950
 easy on caramelized in time 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.019
 might now like to be diligent 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.489
 peel whole kilo carrots first and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:25.120
 cut into small cubes when time 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.069
 where they caramelize a bit 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.930
 so will start now very light brown 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.449
 you just take your whole 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.310
 There are also small chopped 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:43.599
 quoted for 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.510
 18 so if you start it gradually 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.939
 Appearance makes as if the carrots 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 sent for small tecan call you 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:55.150
 Just choose something soft then do it 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.299
 she almost now about next 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.769
 the same a lot of cut 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.870
 potatoes now action thinnest to 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.280
 now synonymous with such a good eight minutes with 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.250
 this one from the outset already 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.230
 a bit muddy from the eaves 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
 next long so 5 to 8 minutes only 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.840
 still with certain when closed 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.299
 Lid naturally occurs so I had 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.690
 kilos of potatoes would be about 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.910
 half a bag of potatoes 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.620
 I appreciate the thing from 500 grams 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.669
 read solved so if the fairy tales now 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.949
 just before being right through are behind 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.690
 down the pot and now we see 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.419
 Our saanen just kick like that 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590
 to 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.120
 which makes now first everything so far 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.500
 purely so now we have two cup 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.000
 Have you ever done it now? 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.000
 everything else as far as it goes 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.080
 puree 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.760
 that all this gives a nice crowd like that 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.710
 if everything is cured so far 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.240
 We cream our last bags because 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.610
 now very thick now 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.870
 we have to stop to give the last 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.789
 mug to cook all over again 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.280
 very short and if it still too 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.630
 then you should be fat 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.370
 again the same process with this 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.510
 cooked meat broth and water 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.990
 just dilute that 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.970
 little 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.560
 and then we will be ready soon 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.800
 great as it all looks like now 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.470
 from beautiful lake me really liquid but 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.490
 still nice for it as a soup 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.289
 let it pass through so much steam 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.050
 Now it's time to get canned now 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.520
 Just do it with salt 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:46.030
 pepper nutmeg and a shot 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:48.070
 Lemon juice buzz so my love that 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.389
 the miracle is really nothing 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.099
 There may be spectacular too 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.520
 here on youtube but what the hell 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.430
 this is my kind of potatoes 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.349
 carrot veloutÃ© up here have papa 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.789
 her on it and I have ours 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.789
 Bus already cut fresh berlocq 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.530
 threatens the regime ulrich total is like 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.789
 bear message is available in real 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.950
 tastes totally awesome 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.240
 we do not need what we do 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.110
 can make an alternative that I have 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.159
 I have already informed myself 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.080
 just shrimp taken the 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.380
 fried and then you can just 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.880
 in the soup with pure dark and then 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.639
 he finds just a few channels happy there 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.659
 he is always up to date with them 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.870

 or not let me thumb because or 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.090
