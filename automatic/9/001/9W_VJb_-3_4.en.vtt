of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> deck<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.289> separate<00:00:58.649> them

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the deck and you can separate them

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
of the deck and you can separate them
red<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.129> black<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
red and black if you want to it just

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
red and black if you want to it just
makes<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.440> makes<00:01:01.679> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:01.949> easier

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
makes it just makes a little bit easier

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.210 
makes it just makes a little bit easier
to<00:01:02.309> set<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.470> go<00:01:04.470> ahead<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.190> one

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to set it up so go ahead and take one

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
to set it up so go ahead and take one
red<00:01:06.060> ace<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.480> doesn't<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.810> matter<00:01:07.050> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
red ace it doesn't really matter and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.100 
red ace it doesn't really matter and
just<00:01:07.980> stick<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> bottom<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.960> deck

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
just stick it on the bottom of the deck

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990 
just stick it on the bottom of the deck
face<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.280> other<00:01:11.430> cards<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.880> face

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
face up so all the other cards are face

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
face up so all the other cards are face
down<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:13.079> you<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.619> card<00:01:13.890> face<00:01:14.130> up

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
down then you get that one card face up

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.730 
down then you get that one card face up
at<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> bottom<00:01:14.810> should<00:01:15.810> look<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> but

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
at the bottom should look like that but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
at the bottom should look like that but
make<00:01:16.890> sure<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.220> red<00:01:17.400> ace<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> second<00:01:19.229> part

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
make sure it's red ace the second part

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580 
make sure it's red ace the second part
is<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> take<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.460> ace<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.060> spades<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.930> put

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is to take the ace of spades and put

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 
is to take the ace of spades and put
this<00:01:22.770> third<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> top<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:25.290> take

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this third from the top and then take

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.490 
this third from the top and then take
the<00:01:25.979> ace<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.579> hearts<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> ace<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the ace of hearts and then the ace of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.450 
the ace of hearts and then the ace of
clubs<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> should<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.680> ace<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.950> spades

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
clubs so you should have ace of spades

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
clubs so you should have ace of spades
hearts<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.570> clubs<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> deck

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
hearts and clubs all on top of the deck

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.740 
hearts and clubs all on top of the deck
when<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:35.790> face<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> make

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
when they're face down you want to make

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
when they're face down you want to make
sure<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> ace<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> clubs<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.399> one<00:01:38.520> on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sure that the ace of clubs is the one on

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
sure that the ace of clubs is the one on
top<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.290> you're<00:01:40.469> actually<00:01:40.740> ready

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
top so from here you're actually ready

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
top so from here you're actually ready
to<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.100> ahead<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.670> actually<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.420> start<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to go ahead and actually just start the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
to go ahead and actually just start the
trick<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.250> point<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.700> have

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
trick so from this point you can have

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
trick so from this point you can have
the<00:01:44.969> spectators<00:01:45.420> pick<00:01:45.659> any<00:01:45.899> card<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the spectators pick any card but you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.690 
the spectators pick any card but you
want<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> middle

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
want to make sure it's from the middle

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.459 
want to make sure it's from the middle
you<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.180> picking<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.960> top<00:01:49.170> card

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
you don't want them picking the top card

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.859 
you don't want them picking the top card
and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> spread<00:01:50.640> too<00:01:51.479> far<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and you don't want to spread too far to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
and you don't want to spread too far to
the<00:01:51.960> bottom<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:53.460> sure<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.969> just

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the bottom so just make sure you just

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
the bottom so just make sure you just
kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> force<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.170> middle<00:01:55.649> card<00:01:55.890> on

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
this and now from this point you're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430 
this and now from this point you're
actually<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.450> doing<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.020> double<00:02:48.140> lift

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620 
actually going to be doing a double lift
obviously<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.580> Ace<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.760> Hearts<00:02:49.970> is

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
obviously because the Ace of Hearts is

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.390 
obviously because the Ace of Hearts is
on<00:02:51.140> top<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.680> don't<00:02:51.710> want<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.040> reveal<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
yet so you say okay so now I also have

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.400

the<00:02:56.030> ace<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.300> spades<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.900> flip<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the ace of spades and you flip the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.830 
the ace of spades and you flip the
double<00:02:57.770> lift<00:02:57.950> over<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.210> reveal<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.720> them

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
double lift over and you reveal to them

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.170 
double lift over and you reveal to them
the<00:02:59.900> ace<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.590> spades<00:03:00.830> I'm<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:01.940> going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.120> be

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the ace of spades I'm not going to be

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.490 
the ace of spades I'm not going to be
going<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.690> depth<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.110> double<00:03:03.380> lift

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
going to in depth the double lift

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.930 
going to in depth the double lift
obviously<00:03:04.100> because<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.610> would<00:03:04.700> make<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
obviously because it would make the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.550 
obviously because it would make the
video<00:03:05.060> really<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:05.870> long<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.260> I'm<00:03:06.380> not

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
video really really long so I'm not

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.660 
video really really long so I'm not
going<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.800> be<00:03:06.890> going<00:03:07.070> into<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.400> but

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to be going into that but

here's<00:04:45.060> your<00:04:45.210> cards<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:45.660> between<00:04:45.750> them<00:04:46.140> you

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
here's your cards in between them you

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.500 
here's your cards in between them you
know<00:04:46.380> just<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.710> make<00:04:46.830> them<00:04:46.980> feel<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.880> little<00:04:48.150> bit

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
know just to make them feel a little bit

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.510 
know just to make them feel a little bit
more<00:04:48.570> secure<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.140> guess<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:50.040> ask<00:04:50.190> them<00:04:50.370> go

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
more secure I guess you ask them go

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.720 
more secure I guess you ask them go
ahead<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.940> push<00:04:51.240> these<00:04:51.510> cards<00:04:51.960> into<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:53.400> Aces

ahead and push these cards into the Aces

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.010 
ahead and push these cards into the Aces
so<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.910> ask<00:04:54.120> them<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.300> push<00:04:54.570> their<00:04:54.750> selected

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
so you ask them to push their selected

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.110 
so you ask them to push their selected
card<00:04:55.170> in<00:04:55.590> between<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.520> Aces<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:56.970> say
