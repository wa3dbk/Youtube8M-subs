withers and the gullet and you want some

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.050 
withers and the gullet and you want some
some<00:02:13.870> space<00:02:14.170> between<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.640> top<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
withers here in the gullet if you have

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.990 
withers here in the gullet if you have
like<00:02:17.620> only<00:02:17.860> about<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.130> finger<00:02:18.459> worth<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> space

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
like only about a finger worth of space

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.210 
like only about a finger worth of space
then<00:02:19.360> your<00:02:19.540> saddle<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.080> probably<00:02:20.440> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> be

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
then your saddle is probably going to be

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.380 
then your saddle is probably going to be
a<00:02:21.250> core<00:02:21.550> fit<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.810> horse<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.360> a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
a core fit for that horse if you have a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
a core fit for that horse if you have a
whole<00:02:25.780> bunch<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.170> space<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.650> saddle<00:02:27.010> sits<00:02:27.250> way

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
whole bunch of space the saddle sits way

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
whole bunch of space the saddle sits way
up<00:02:27.610> like<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:29.080> you're<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
up like this then you're going to have a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
up like this then you're going to have a
rockin<00:02:30.400> saddle<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.820> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> become

every<00:02:47.410> horse<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.640> make<00:02:48.790> do

but you got to understand that what to
look<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:54.610> poor<00:02:54.820> saddle<00:02:55.209> fit<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.630> you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
look for for poor saddle fit so you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.460 
look for for poor saddle fit so you
don't<00:02:56.170> impact<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.950> your<00:02:57.100> horses<00:02:57.370> ride<00:02:57.640> ability

don't impact on your horses ride ability
but<00:02:59.470> anyway<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.980> got<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.340> saddle<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:00.910> here<00:03:01.120> I'm

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
but anyway I got the saddle up here I'm

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.789 
but anyway I got the saddle up here I'm
checking<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.690> bars<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.200> make<00:03:02.320> sure<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.650> on

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
checking the bars and make sure it's on

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.550 
checking the bars and make sure it's on
the<00:03:03.160> horse<00:03:03.400> has<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.030> back<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.110> scapula

the horse has to be back in the scapula
you<00:03:05.830> don't<00:03:05.980> want<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> bars<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.640> saddle<00:03:07.269> over

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
you don't want the bars that saddle over

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.039 
you don't want the bars that saddle over
the<00:03:08.080> scapula<00:03:09.360> sometimes<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.510> saddle<00:03:10.930> will

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the scapula sometimes the saddle will

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.979 
the scapula sometimes the saddle will
fit<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.470> little<00:03:11.980> higher<00:03:12.160> up<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.269> if<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
over the scapula I think that's okay

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it's like this all pulls over so you can

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.810 
neoprene cinch or something that's not
soft<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.440> always<00:04:16.650> use<00:04:16.829> these<00:04:17.039> these<00:04:17.280> fleece<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.539 
soft I always use these these fleece and
fronts<00:04:18.449> inches<00:04:18.810> but<00:04:18.989> we<00:04:19.590> pull<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.010> up<00:04:20.099> too<00:04:20.310> far

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
fronts inches but we pull it up too far

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.430 
fronts inches but we pull it up too far
forward<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.780> rub<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.199> horse<00:04:22.410> here<00:04:23.360> so

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
forward it can rub on the horse here so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.659 
forward it can rub on the horse here so
make<00:04:25.440> sure<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.680> goes<00:04:25.770> right<00:04:25.949> behind<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.400> elbow

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
make sure it goes right behind the elbow

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.180 
make sure it goes right behind the elbow
if<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.630> d-ring<00:04:28.020> your<00:04:28.199> saddle<00:04:28.620> move

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
if you have the d-ring your saddle move

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.249 
if you have the d-ring your saddle move
a<00:04:29.220> little<00:04:29.400> bit<00:04:29.490> far<00:04:29.759> backs<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.930> your<00:04:31.080> sense

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
a little bit far backs so your sense

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.290 
a little bit far backs so your sense
comes<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.910> may<00:04:33.060> cause<00:04:33.270> a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
comes in like that that may cause a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.800 
comes in like that that may cause a
little<00:04:33.720> bit<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:35.389> discomfort<00:04:36.389> to<00:04:36.539> them<00:04:36.660> or

little bit of a discomfort to them or

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.850 
little bit of a discomfort to them or
more<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:38.720> unstability<00:04:39.720> with<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.080> saddle<00:04:40.470> if
