managers<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.930> essentially<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.070> trash<00:00:32.340> fish

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640

really<00:00:34.440> fished<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.070> him<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> managers

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
really fished for him so the managers

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850 
really fished for him so the managers
didn't<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.450> spend<00:00:36.809> time<00:00:37.020> collecting<00:00:37.680> data

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
in the early 1900s they're vulnerable

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.719 
in the early 1900s they're vulnerable
because<00:02:00.749> like<00:02:01.020> gar<00:02:01.319> it<00:02:01.649> takes<00:02:01.919> them<00:02:02.159> years<00:02:02.189> to

so far we don't want to get in the

so far we don't want to get in the
situation<00:02:13.500> where<00:02:13.680> we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
situation where we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.370

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
have to react to overharvest I fished a

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.290 
have to react to overharvest I fished a
lot<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.190> I've<00:02:17.400> never<00:02:17.580> really<00:02:17.819> fished<00:02:18.120> for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
lot and I've never really fished for

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.059 
lot and I've never really fished for
alligator<00:02:18.690> gar<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> tell<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:19.890> after

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
alligator gar but I tell you what after

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
alligator gar but I tell you what after
working<00:02:20.459> with<00:02:20.610> them<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.090> would<00:02:21.720> definitely

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
working with them I would definitely

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.020 
working with them I would definitely
fish<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.620> alligator<00:02:22.950> gar<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.280> would<00:02:23.430> recommend

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
fish for alligator gar I would recommend

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.809 
fish for alligator gar I would recommend
anyone<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:26.069> Texas<00:02:26.400> Parks<00:02:26.430> &amp;

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
anyone to do that for Texas Parks &amp;

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.550 
anyone to do that for Texas Parks &amp;
Wildlife<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.160> Abe<00:02:29.490> Moore
