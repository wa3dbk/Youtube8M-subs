have one for a because I can only find

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.970 
have one for a because I can only find
one<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.270> could<00:00:33.420> hit<00:00:33.540> consistently<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.469> that

one that could hit consistently and that
one<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.579> over<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> left<00:00:37.530> side<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
one is over here on the left side of the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.380 
one is over here on the left side of the
map<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.469> corner<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.790> big

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
map and it's on this corner of this big

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
map and it's on this corner of this big
dumpster<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.520> look

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
dumpster here and then just look

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
dumpster here and then just look
straight<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 

and<00:00:50.910> then<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.830> over<00:00:52.860> between

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and then for be just run over between

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.570 
and then for be just run over between
the<00:00:53.550> sign<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.240> and<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> train<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.370> look<00:00:56.370> up

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
the sign here and the train and look up

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.250 
the sign here and the train and look up
and<00:00:56.790> let<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.240> knife<00:00:57.480> fly<00:01:02.600> second<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.840> B<00:01:03.990> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and let a knife fly second one for B is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
and let a knife fly second one for B is
in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> back<00:01:04.920> spawn<00:01:05.190> between<00:01:05.580> these<00:01:05.760> two

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
in the back spawn between these two

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.280 
in the back spawn between these two
wooden<00:01:06.870> boxes<00:01:07.290> here

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.730 

and<00:01:16.270> then<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.480> first<00:01:17.720> month<00:01:17.960> or<00:01:18.050> see<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.470> think

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
and then the first month or see I think

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.470 
and then the first month or see I think
we'll<00:01:19.010> be<00:01:19.130> using<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.610> couple<00:01:19.880> more<00:01:20.030> times<00:01:20.240> after

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
we'll be using a couple more times after

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.810 
we'll be using a couple more times after
this<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.410> just<00:01:21.860> go<00:01:21.980> in<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.220> corner<00:01:22.640> between

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
this so just go in this corner between

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:33.700 
this so just go in this corner between
these<00:01:23.180> front<00:01:23.480> chairs<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.050> pool<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:32.710> then

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
these front chairs and the pool and then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.220 
these front chairs and the pool and then
the<00:01:33.980> other<00:01:34.010> 14<00:01:34.520> c<00:01:34.730> is<00:01:34.940> simply<00:01:35.630> at<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.810> corner

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
the other 14 c is simply at the corner

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:45.330 
the other 14 c is simply at the corner
of<00:01:36.260> this<00:01:36.500> building

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.160 

now<00:01:46.340> because<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.180> lack<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.390> camping<00:01:47.930> spots

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
now because of the lack of camping spots

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.230 
now because of the lack of camping spots
in<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.410> map<00:01:48.620> I<00:01:48.770> was<00:01:48.950> only<00:01:49.070> able<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.730> find<00:01:49.970> one

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
in this map I was only able to find one

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.840 
in this map I was only able to find one
spot<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.620> one<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.890> by<00:01:52.370> going<00:01:52.640> behind

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
spot and that one is by going behind

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.940 
spot and that one is by going behind
this<00:01:53.150> vending<00:01:53.480> machine<00:01:53.810> look<00:01:54.440> up<00:01:54.620> and<00:01:54.830> have

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950

guys<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.689> think<00:04:14.959> that's<00:04:15.139> it<00:04:15.290> for<00:04:15.319> underground<00:04:15.980> I

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
guys I think that's it for underground I

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.890 
guys I think that's it for underground I
know<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.400> was<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.579> really<00:04:16.910> short<00:04:17.329> episode<00:04:17.870> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
know it was a really short episode I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.479 
know it was a really short episode I
didn't<00:04:18.199> have<00:04:18.320> much<00:04:18.530> time<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.859> make<00:04:19.039> this<00:04:19.280> video

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
