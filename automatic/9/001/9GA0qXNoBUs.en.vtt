00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
thing which needs 30 seconds own I have

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
thing which needs 30 seconds own I have
a<00:00:25.220> seven<00:00:26.220> turns<00:00:26.720> long<00:00:28.039> algorithm<00:00:30.529> very<00:00:31.529> nice<00:00:31.859> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
a seven turns long algorithm very nice I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
a seven turns long algorithm very nice I
figured<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> yesterday<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:35.329> yeah<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

and upload it yeah okay um first I will
get<00:00:45.829> into<00:00:46.879> penalty<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
get into penalty and so and that was the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.799 
get into penalty and so and that was the
party<00:00:52.469> other<00:00:52.649> room<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
party other room so if you get to this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.790 
party other room so if you get to this
case<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> first

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
case if you have this this is the first

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.450 
case if you have this this is the first
case<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.780> officer<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.890> saw<00:01:02.129> what

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
case where these officer I just saw what

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.740 
case where these officer I just saw what
I'm<00:01:03.589> for<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.790> case<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:12.330> last

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I'm for it to this case for your last

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:31.160 
I'm for it to this case for your last
class<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:28.200> last<00:01:28.470> case<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.840> solve

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
class so all this last case so you solve

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.120 
class so all this last case so you solve
it<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:32.119> em<00:01:33.680> like<00:01:34.680> normal<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.680> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> solve

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
it like em like normal and if you solve

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320 
it like em like normal and if you solve
this<00:01:38.430> old

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.260 

then<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.960> get<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:45.650> first<00:01:46.400> coding<00:01:46.880> that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
then you get to this first coding that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.620 
then you get to this first coding that
parity<00:01:47.780> case<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.620> these<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:49.100> small<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.360> oh

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
parity case but these are small so oh

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:01.870 
parity case but these are small so oh
it's<00:01:51.260> all<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:56.680> now<00:01:57.680> maybe<00:01:58.520> cuz<00:01:59.000> yeah<00:02:00.430> these<00:02:01.430> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's all so now maybe cuz yeah these and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.920 
it's all so now maybe cuz yeah these and
these<00:02:02.780> are<00:02:03.050> not<00:02:03.260> slopped<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:05.360> hold<00:02:05.630> it

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
these are not slopped so you hold it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.050 
these are not slopped so you hold it
that<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:08.229> here<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.460> here<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:13.010> here<00:02:13.520> yeah

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
that it's here and here here here yeah

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.990 
that it's here and here here here yeah
and<00:02:15.130> hold<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:16.670> left<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.300> front<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:19.000> get

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and hold it right left and front and get

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.280 
and hold it right left and front and get
you<00:02:22.780> locust<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.810> two<00:02:25.090> are<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:27.640> f2<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.290> only

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you locust you two are to f2 then only

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.210 
you locust you two are to f2 then only
the<00:02:30.620> muck<00:02:30.830> slice<00:02:31.840> youtube<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:35.020> after<00:02:36.220> our

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the muck slice youtube then after our

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.940 
the muck slice youtube then after our
gym<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.500> now<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.950> it's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
gym you and now you can see it's

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.520 
gym you and now you can see it's
completely<00:02:43.700> solved<00:02:45.280> yeah<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.330> maybe<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.470> can
