00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
the bottom here there's a little metal

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.200 
the bottom here there's a little metal
tray<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.920> can<00:00:27.010> actually<00:00:27.310> remove<00:00:27.610> this<00:00:27.880> and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
tray you can actually remove this and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.000 
tray you can actually remove this and
then<00:00:28.480> just<00:00:28.840> below<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.110> is<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.350> reservoir<00:00:29.740> for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
then just below it is a reservoir for

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.590 
then just below it is a reservoir for
catching<00:00:30.400> additional<00:00:31.150> water<00:00:31.270> that<00:00:31.480> might

catching additional water that might

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.540 
catching additional water that might
drip<00:00:31.870> out<00:00:31.930> of<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.079> machine<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:33.309> can<00:00:33.430> also

drip out of the machine you can also
remove<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.030> entirely<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.809> then<00:00:34.929> you<00:00:35.019> can<00:00:35.170> fit

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
remove it entirely and then you can fit

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.829 
remove it entirely and then you can fit
in<00:00:35.589> larger<00:00:36.249> cups<00:00:36.640> now<00:00:37.149> something<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.570> can't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
in larger cups now something you can't

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.790 
see is that there's a little lip under
here<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.699> that<00:00:40.149> lip<00:00:40.359> actually<00:00:40.780> holds<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
here and that lip actually holds the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.099 
here and that lip actually holds the
tray<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.429> it<00:00:42.940> allows<00:00:43.120> you<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.390> put<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.629> smaller

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109

bit<00:01:32.979> larger<00:01:33.310> than<00:01:33.399> espresso<00:01:33.759> one<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.180> that's

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
bit larger than espresso one so that's

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.480 
bit larger than espresso one so that's
part<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.689> it<00:01:34.840> but<00:01:35.409> Nespresso<00:01:35.859> says<00:01:36.189> that<00:01:36.399> it

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
part of it but Nespresso says that it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.480 
part of it but Nespresso says that it
takes<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:37.450> brews<00:01:38.109> to<00:01:38.350> each<00:01:38.560> pod

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
takes it brews to each pod

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.789 
takes it brews to each pod
I<00:01:39.520> suppose<00:01:40.299> dependent<00:01:40.810> upon<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.200> coffee<00:01:41.469> and

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
I suppose dependent upon the coffee and

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.800 
I suppose dependent upon the coffee and
so<00:01:42.789> why<00:01:42.969> don't<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.119> take<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.509> through<00:01:43.750> them

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
so why don't we take you through them

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.060 
so why don't we take you through them
we'll<00:01:44.170> hit<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.409> button<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.829> can<00:01:44.950> see

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
we'll hit the button and you can see

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.340 
we'll hit the button and you can see
what<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.280> looks<00:01:45.429> like<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:46.630> listen<00:01:46.929> carefully

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
what it looks like now listen carefully

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.569 
what it looks like now listen carefully
and<00:01:47.439> you'll<00:01:47.560> begin<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.829> hear<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.399> there's

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
and you'll begin to hear that there's

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.520 
and you'll begin to hear that there's
something<00:01:49.329> going<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.170> you'll<00:01:50.320> hear

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
something going on in there you'll hear

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.130 
something going on in there you'll hear
what<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:50.979> Center<00:01:51.789> fuge<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.450> that's<00:01:52.899> called

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
what is a Center fuge and that's called

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.539 
what is a Center fuge and that's called
Center<00:01:53.469> fusion<00:01:53.770> technology<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.429> this<00:01:54.490> is

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
Center fusion technology and this is

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.730 
Center fusion technology and this is
actually<00:01:55.060> I'd<00:01:55.179> assume<00:01:55.479> its<00:01:55.630> proprietary<00:01:56.200> in

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
actually I'd assume its proprietary in

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.800 
actually I'd assume its proprietary in
espresso<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.609> that's<00:01:57.759> what<00:01:57.969> gives<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.539> its

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
espresso and that's what gives it its

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.410 
espresso and that's what gives it its
its<00:01:59.710> crema<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.460> you'll<00:02:00.729> see<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.179> just<00:02:01.210> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
its crema and you'll see that in just a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.750 
its crema and you'll see that in just a
second

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
second

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.390 
second
smells<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.390> coffeehouse<00:02:04.040> sting<00:02:05.040> faster

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
smells like a coffeehouse sting faster

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.330 
smells like a coffeehouse sting faster
and<00:02:05.520> faster<00:02:06.410> so<00:02:07.410> there<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and faster so there you have it there is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
and faster so there you have it there is
a<00:02:08.369> cup<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.940> coffee<00:02:09.150> from<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.750> Nespresso<00:02:10.140> bar

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.030 
to alignment now when you're finished
brewing<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.450> cup<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.720> coffee<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.710> go<00:02:13.830> back

brewing your cup of coffee you go back

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.040 
brewing your cup of coffee you go back
up<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.280> turn<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.450> unlocks<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
up here turn the right this unlocks the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.600 
up here turn the right this unlocks the
machine<00:02:16.350> now<00:02:16.500> watch<00:02:16.710> carefully<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> top

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
machine now watch carefully at the top

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.220 
machine now watch carefully at the top
you'll<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.060> pot<00:02:18.270> actually<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.750> inserted

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
you'll see the pot actually get inserted

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.230 
you'll see the pot actually get inserted
to<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.440> bin<00:02:19.650> over<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.790> happens

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
to the bin over here and that happens

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.150 
to the bin over here and that happens
through<00:02:21.330> some<00:02:21.720> guides<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.140> top<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.950> just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
through some guides at the top and just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.920 
through some guides at the top and just
drops<00:02:23.370> them<00:02:23.520> there<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.570> makes<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> an

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
drops them there so what makes it an

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.450 
drops them there so what makes it an
espresso<00:02:25.170> bar<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.620> our<00:02:25.710> line<00:02:25.890> special<00:02:26.340> well

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
espresso bar to our line special well

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.800 
espresso bar to our line special well
first<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.880> look<00:02:27.030> underneath<00:02:27.300> here<00:02:27.630> you'll

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
first if you look underneath here you'll

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.600 
first if you look underneath here you'll
see<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.200> there's<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.620> little<00:02:28.980> dial<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.550> on

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
see that there's a little dial and on

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.130 
see that there's a little dial and on
that<00:02:29.760> dial<00:02:29.970> there's<00:02:30.210> spikes<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.960> put

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that dial there's spikes so when you put

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.450 
that dial there's spikes so when you put
the<00:02:31.230> pot<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.890> close<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.190> it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
the pot in there and you close it it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.610 
the pot in there and you close it it
punctures<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.630> what<00:02:33.810> happens<00:02:34.440> actually

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
punctures it but what happens actually

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.830 
punctures it but what happens actually
during<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.130> brewing<00:02:35.310> process<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.180> water

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
during the brewing process is that water

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.620 
during the brewing process is that water
hot<00:02:37.320> water<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.830> put<00:02:38.130> into<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.640> pod<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.210> that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
hot water is put into the pod and that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.660 
hot water is put into the pod and that
pot<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> actually<00:02:40.500> being<00:02:40.740> spun<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.520> being

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
pot is actually being spun it's being

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.570 
pot is actually being spun it's being
spun<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> 7,000<00:02:42.840> rpms<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.560> that's<00:02:44.280> what

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
spun up to 7,000 rpms and that's what

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.490 
spun up to 7,000 rpms and that's what
results<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.510> crema<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.320> very

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
results in this crema which is very

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
results in this crema which is very
difficult<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.100> come<00:02:47.310> by<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.330> know

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
difficult to come by and it you know

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.480 
difficult to come by and it you know
it's<00:02:49.290> pretty<00:02:49.500> phenomenal<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.400> is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
it's pretty phenomenal that there is

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330 
it's pretty phenomenal that there is
this<00:02:50.760> much<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.720> cup<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.020> coffee<00:02:52.200> from<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.100> home

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
this much in a cup of coffee from a home

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.590 
this much in a cup of coffee from a home
brewed<00:02:53.910> cup<00:02:54.300> or<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> home<00:02:55.050> brewing<00:02:55.440> machine<00:02:56.600> so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
brewed cup or a home brewing machine so

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.550 
brewed cup or a home brewing machine so
let<00:02:57.630> me<00:02:57.810> give<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> some<00:02:58.110> thoughts<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
let me give you some thoughts and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
let me give you some thoughts and
espresso<00:02:58.800> through<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> sewer<00:02:59.280> line<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.270> we'll

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
espresso through a sewer line so we'll

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.750 
espresso through a sewer line so we'll
start<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> COG<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.640> machine

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
start the COG on so you know the machine

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.120 
start the COG on so you know the machine
doesn't<00:03:03.060> clean<00:03:03.300> itself<00:03:03.630> after<00:03:03.780> each<00:03:04.140> use<00:03:04.410> you

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
doesn't clean itself after each use you
