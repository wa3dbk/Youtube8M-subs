differently every time they go through
it<00:00:55.430> but<00:00:55.520> for<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.760> most<00:00:55.880> part<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:57.489> revolves

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
it but for the most part it revolves

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.910 
it but for the most part it revolves
around<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.760> same<00:00:58.940> basics<00:00:59.420> okay<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.710> when<00:01:00.860> they

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
around the same basics okay so when they

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680 
around the same basics okay so when they
make<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.250> F<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.300> kind<00:01:02.450> of<00:01:02.480> how<00:01:02.570> they

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
make this F this is kind of how they

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.120 
make this F this is kind of how they
pluck<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.050> okay<00:01:03.230> they<00:01:03.350> go<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.830> they<00:01:06.950> basically

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130

all right the next time through it

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.340 
all right the next time through it
switches<00:05:50.730> up<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.060> little<00:05:51.240> bit<00:05:51.390> instead<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.200> a

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
switches up a little bit instead of a
