five seasons and he's been mastered for
like<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.700> season<00:01:19.510> he'll<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.500> easy<00:01:20.740> for<00:01:20.979> him

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.210 
to get into platinum or master probably
get<00:01:55.750> into<00:01:55.930> bronze<00:01:56.170> or<00:01:56.380> silver<00:01:56.410> this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.070> his

get into bronze or silver this is his

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.910 
get into bronze or silver this is his
first<00:01:57.430> time<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.470> they're<00:01:59.470> going<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.619> make<00:01:59.680> him

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
first time and they're going to make him

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.430 
first time and they're going to make him
work<00:02:00.100> his<00:02:00.280> way<00:02:00.490> up<00:02:00.660> for<00:02:01.660> example<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.259> seen

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
work his way up for example if you seen

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.790 
work his way up for example if you seen
a<00:02:02.560> shot<00:02:02.770> he<00:02:03.700> started<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.479> new<00:02:04.630> account<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.200> he

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
a shot he started a new account and he

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.290 
a shot he started a new account and he
played<00:02:06.039> League<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> he<00:02:06.850> create<00:02:07.119> put

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
played League on that and he create put

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.820 
played League on that and he create put
him<00:02:07.390> into<00:02:07.479> bronze<00:02:07.960> because<00:02:08.289> that's<00:02:08.560> his<00:02:08.649> first

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
him into bronze because that's his first

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.699 
him into bronze because that's his first
season<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.540> host<00:02:10.540> did<00:02:11.019> pretty<00:02:11.170> much<00:02:11.230> different

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
season I host did pretty much different

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.440 
season I host did pretty much different
for<00:02:11.830> everyone<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.850> got<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.090> keep<00:02:13.120> playing

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
for everyone so you got to keep playing

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.960 
for everyone so you got to keep playing
again<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.830> play<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.310> gayby<00:02:15.580> season

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
again you have to play a gayby season

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.550 
again you have to play a gayby season
and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.100 
and
when<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.630> example<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.959> first

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
when and like for example the first

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.260 
when and like for example the first
season<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.440> play<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.130> Gold<00:02:20.340> next

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
season you play you go to Gold next

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.000 
season you play you go to Gold next
season<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.480> play<00:02:21.780> they'll<00:02:22.410> probably<00:02:22.620> put<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
season you play they'll probably put you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.240 
season you play they'll probably put you
into<00:02:23.160> gold<00:02:23.489> instead<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> iron<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.770> if

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
into gold instead of iron and then if

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
into gold instead of iron and then if
you<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.520> into<00:02:26.750> platinum<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.140> season<00:02:29.069> after

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
you get into platinum and season after

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.470 
you get into platinum and season after
that<00:02:29.370> you'll<00:02:29.489> probably<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.880> platinum<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that you'll probably get a platinum and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.640 
that you'll probably get a platinum and
probably<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.020> win<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> couple<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.470> games

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
probably have to win a couple of games

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
probably have to win a couple of games
and<00:02:31.860> you'll<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.550> into<00:02:32.790> master<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.269> here<00:02:33.480> also

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and you'll get into master for here also

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.809 
and you'll get into master for here also
about<00:02:34.319> how<00:02:34.530> much<00:02:34.650> points<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.099> get<00:02:35.280> well<00:02:35.670> I've

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
about how much points you get well I've

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.320 
about how much points you get well I've
time<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.150> win<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.230> depends<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:38.330> who

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
time you win that's all depends on who

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.089 
time you win that's all depends on who
you<00:02:39.510> play<00:02:39.690> against<00:02:40.140> if<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.470> play<00:02:40.620> gets<00:02:40.830> really

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
you play against if you play gets really

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.979 
you play against if you play gets really
good<00:02:41.220> players<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.390> shit<00:02:42.630> people<00:02:42.810> in

your team and if you want that game you
go<00:02:44.970> 150<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:46.590> facing<00:02:46.769> against<00:02:47.099> like
