let's talk about dog allergies now dogs
get<00:00:13.090> allergic<00:00:13.390> to<00:00:13.780> many<00:00:14.230> of<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.440> same<00:00:14.680> things

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
get allergic to many of the same things

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.970 
get allergic to many of the same things
that<00:00:15.580> we<00:00:16.029> get<00:00:16.240> alerts<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:16.720> as<00:00:16.810> people<00:00:17.140> the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
that we get alerts to as people the

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.279 
that we get alerts to as people the
difference<00:00:18.400> is<00:00:18.579> they<00:00:18.999> manifest<00:00:19.749> it<00:00:19.960> in<00:00:20.109> a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
difference is they manifest it in a

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.429 
difference is they manifest it in a
different<00:00:20.619> way<00:00:20.859> instead<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.720> getting<00:00:22.929> the

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
different way instead of getting the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.989 
different way instead of getting the
symptoms<00:00:23.859> of<00:00:24.070> hay<00:00:24.640> fever<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:26.730> runny<00:00:27.730> nose

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
symptoms of hay fever and runny nose

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.249 
symptoms of hay fever and runny nose
congestion<00:00:30.149> richey<00:00:31.149> is<00:00:31.359> that<00:00:31.810> sort<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.169> thing

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
congestion richey is that sort of thing

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.509 
congestion richey is that sort of thing
they<00:00:33.040> get<00:00:33.370> primarily<00:00:34.149> symptoms<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.140> skin

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
they get primarily symptoms of the skin

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.770 
they get primarily symptoms of the skin
so<00:00:36.519> they<00:00:36.670> may<00:00:36.820> be<00:00:36.879> allergic<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.570> same

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
so they may be allergic to the same

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.779 
so they may be allergic to the same
things<00:00:38.079> they<00:00:38.590> just<00:00:38.620> manifest<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.460> differently

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
things they just manifest it differently

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:46.020 
things they just manifest it differently
