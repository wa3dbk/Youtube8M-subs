to<00:00:08.760> talk<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.179> scope<00:00:09.570> reticles<00:00:10.019> now

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
to talk to you about scope reticles now

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.720 
to talk to you about scope reticles now
we're<00:00:10.740> all<00:00:10.830> familiar<00:00:10.950> when<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.490> looking

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we're all familiar when we're looking

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.190 
we're all familiar when we're looking
through<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.910> scope<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.509> crosshair<00:00:12.840> in

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
through a scope with that crosshair in

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.560 
through a scope with that crosshair in
the<00:00:13.320> center<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.799> that's<00:00:14.759> basically<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.420> we

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the center and that's basically what we

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.359 
the center and that's basically what we
use<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.900> align<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> scope<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> target

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
use to align the scope with the target

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.340 
use to align the scope with the target
now<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.449> might<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.750> know<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.230> there

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
now some of you might not know but there

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080 
now some of you might not know but there
are<00:00:19.470> many<00:00:19.680> different<00:00:20.220> types<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.789> scope

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
are many different types of scope

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
going to drop and do a holdover let's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
going to drop and do a holdover let's
say<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> deer<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.920> 200<00:00:56.370> yards<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
say you see a deer at 200 yards if you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
say you see a deer at 200 yards if you
have<00:00:57.449> 100<00:00:57.899> yards<00:00:58.140> zero<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> set<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
have 100 yards zero and set up just

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.860 
have 100 yards zero and set up just
adjusting<00:00:59.910> those<00:01:00.000> turrets<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> actually

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
adjusting those turrets you can actually

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
adjusting those turrets you can actually
just<00:01:01.140> holdover<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> second<00:01:02.309> thought<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
just holdover on the second thought and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
just holdover on the second thought and
take<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> shot<00:01:03.899> without<00:01:04.110> wasting<00:01:04.589> time<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
take that shot without wasting time and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
take that shot without wasting time and
the<00:01:05.100> possibility<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> game<00:01:06.360> pivot<00:01:06.659> away

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
