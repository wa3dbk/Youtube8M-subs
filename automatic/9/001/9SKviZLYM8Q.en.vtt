well<00:00:04.180> hello<00:00:04.450> from<00:00:04.690> dr.<00:00:05.080> brew<00:00:05.290> we'd<00:00:06.279> like<00:00:06.460> to

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
well hello from dr. brew we'd like to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.020 
well hello from dr. brew we'd like to
run<00:00:07.810> a<00:00:07.870> little<00:00:07.930> concept<00:00:08.620> by<00:00:08.799> you<00:00:08.860> today<00:00:09.129> of<00:00:09.520> how

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
run a little concept by you today of how

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.850 
run a little concept by you today of how
to<00:00:10.090> brew<00:00:10.420> that<00:00:10.450> perfect<00:00:11.080> cup<00:00:11.200> of<00:00:11.320> coffee<00:00:11.530> and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
to brew that perfect cup of coffee and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.180 
to brew that perfect cup of coffee and
part<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:12.700> that<00:00:12.880> is<00:00:13.210> just<00:00:13.660> simply<00:00:14.530> letting<00:00:14.950> a

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
part of that is just simply letting a

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.010 
part of that is just simply letting a
brew<00:00:15.519> come<00:00:16.240> to<00:00:16.360> completion<00:00:16.960> as<00:00:17.110> we<00:00:18.009> brew<00:00:18.550> today

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
brew come to completion as we brew today

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.999 
brew come to completion as we brew today
we're<00:00:20.020> going<00:00:20.169> to<00:00:20.380> take<00:00:20.560> our<00:00:20.770> brew<00:00:20.919> funnel

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
we're going to take our brew funnel

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.460 
we're going to take our brew funnel
insert<00:00:24.009> our<00:00:24.250> amount<00:00:25.090> of<00:00:25.210> coffee<00:00:25.390> leveling<00:00:26.349> it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
insert our amount of coffee leveling it

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.429 
insert our amount of coffee leveling it
so<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.800> bed<00:00:26.980> is<00:00:27.189> level<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.730> as<00:00:28.660> we<00:00:28.840> place<00:00:29.140> the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
so the bed is level and as we place the

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.010 
so the bed is level and as we place the
funnel<00:00:30.189> into<00:00:30.399> the<00:00:30.489> brewer<00:00:30.820> will<00:00:31.599> turn<00:00:31.869> the

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
funnel into the brewer will turn the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.520 
funnel into the brewer will turn the
warmer<00:00:32.380> on<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:32.860> begin<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.730> brewing<00:00:34.030> process

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
warmer on and begin the brewing process

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.220 
warmer on and begin the brewing process
the<00:00:35.530> brewing<00:00:35.860> process<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:37.570> evolves

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
the brewing process actually evolves

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.710 
the brewing process actually evolves
just<00:00:38.560> as<00:00:38.680> if<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:39.010> were<00:00:39.040> baking<00:00:39.700> a<00:00:39.790> cake<00:00:40.030> there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
just as if you were baking a cake there

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.700 
just as if you were baking a cake there
is<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.010> mixing<00:00:42.010> process<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.410> fluids<00:00:44.410> and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
is a mixing process of the fluids and

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.280 
is a mixing process of the fluids and
the<00:00:45.160> material<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.120> we<00:00:46.240> want<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.540> bake<00:00:46.780> just

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
the material that we want to bake just

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.020 
the material that we want to bake just
like<00:00:47.470> we're<00:00:47.710> blending<00:00:47.950> here<00:00:48.370> water<00:00:48.730> with

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
like we're blending here water with

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.200 
like we're blending here water with
coffee<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.660> we<00:00:50.260> want<00:00:50.500> this<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:51.130> come<00:00:51.970> to<00:00:52.180> a

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
coffee and we want this to come to a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.990 
coffee and we want this to come to a
complete<00:00:52.870> end<00:00:53.170> just<00:00:53.829> as<00:00:54.010> if<00:00:54.160> we<00:00:54.340> were<00:00:54.460> baking<00:00:54.700> a

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
complete end just as if we were baking a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.479 
complete end just as if we were baking a
cake<00:00:55.210> if<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:55.900> pull<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.200> early<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:57.070> end<00:00:57.280> up

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
cake if you pull it early you end up

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.160 
cake if you pull it early you end up
with<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.670> less<00:00:58.030> than<00:00:58.210> desirable<00:00:58.540> product

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
with a less than desirable product

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.060 
with a less than desirable product
brewing<00:00:59.920> coffee<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.460> much<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.730> same<00:01:00.910> way

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
brewing coffee is much the same way

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.859 
brewing coffee is much the same way
during<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.370> brew<00:01:03.610> process<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.629> brew

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
during this brew process the brew

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.440 
during this brew process the brew
actually<00:01:05.560> comes<00:01:06.189> through<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.640> phases<00:01:07.240> where

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
actually comes through in phases where

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.750 
actually comes through in phases where
you<00:01:07.540> have<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.810> strong<00:01:08.260> intense<00:01:08.860> flavor<00:01:09.220> profile

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
you have a strong intense flavor profile

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.610 
you have a strong intense flavor profile
in<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.150> first<00:01:10.420> third<00:01:10.720> then<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.110> begins<00:01:11.350> to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
in the first third then it begins to

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.490 
in the first third then it begins to
lighten<00:01:11.979> up<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.729> tail<00:01:12.940> end<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.450> very<00:01:14.110> pale

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
lighten up and the tail end is very pale

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.430 
lighten up and the tail end is very pale
and<00:01:14.800> you've<00:01:15.580> extinguished<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.540> good<00:01:17.080> parts

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
and you've extinguished the good parts

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.620 
and you've extinguished the good parts
of<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.650> coffee<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.220> want<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.549> take<00:01:18.760> right

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
of the coffee that we want to take right

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.719 
of the coffee that we want to take right
now<00:01:19.659> we<00:01:19.900> have<00:01:20.260> approximately<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:21.100> cup<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.670> a

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
now we have approximately a cup and a

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.380 
now we have approximately a cup and a
half<00:01:22.350> brewed<00:01:23.350> into<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.799> decanter<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:25.210> what

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
half brewed into the decanter so what

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.440 
half brewed into the decanter so what
we're<00:01:25.540> going<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.810> do<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.350> demonstrate<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:27.190> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
we're going to do to demonstrate this is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
we're going to do to demonstrate this is
capture<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> portion<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.020> compare

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
capture a portion and use it to compare

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.760 
capture a portion and use it to compare
with<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.820> middle<00:01:34.119> brew<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.750> near<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.320> end<00:01:35.470> of

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
with the middle brew and near the end of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.420 
with the middle brew and near the end of
the<00:01:35.860> proof

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990 

here<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.580> have<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> sample<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.310> front<00:01:47.640> third

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here we have a sample of the front third

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.620 
here we have a sample of the front third
of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.300> brew<00:01:48.480> cycle<00:01:48.930> we'll<00:01:49.530> set<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:49.830> aside

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.540 

and<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:55.080> brew<00:01:55.229> cycle<00:01:55.500> continues<00:01:56.190> here

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and as the brew cycle continues here

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.310 
and as the brew cycle continues here
we'll<00:01:56.910> take<00:01:57.120> another<00:01:57.420> sample<00:01:57.690> at

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
we'll take another sample at

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
we'll take another sample at
approximately<00:01:59.040> half<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.400> decanter<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.270> brew

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
approximately half a decanter the brew

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.219 
approximately half a decanter the brew
cycle<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.110> approximately<00:02:07.800> half<00:02:08.039> complete

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
cycle is now approximately half complete

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.610 
cycle is now approximately half complete
we'll<00:02:10.229> capture<00:02:10.500> another<00:02:10.920> sample<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
we'll capture another sample and as you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.610 
we'll capture another sample and as you
can<00:02:13.739> see<00:02:13.800> already<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.580> color<00:02:15.480> compared<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
can see already the color compared to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220 
can see already the color compared to
the<00:02:16.739> first<00:02:16.950> cup<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.489> drew<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.480> considerably

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the first cup we drew is considerably

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:29.750 
the first cup we drew is considerably
lighter<00:02:27.800> we'll<00:02:28.800> set<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.190> one<00:02:29.370> aside<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
lighter we'll set this one aside and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.270 
lighter we'll set this one aside and
wait<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.390> last<00:02:30.570> one

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.190 

one<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> important<00:02:37.480> parts<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
one of the important parts of this and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.660 
one of the important parts of this and
I'm<00:02:38.320> sure<00:02:38.590> you've<00:02:38.830> seen<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.340> your<00:02:39.490> office

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that has a pause sequence so you can

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.150 
that has a pause sequence so you can
draw<00:02:45.430> coffee<00:02:45.820> early<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.570> you'll<00:02:47.440> find<00:02:47.800> that

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.670 

and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:36.070> we'll<00:03:36.250> use<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.640> as<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.820> comparison
