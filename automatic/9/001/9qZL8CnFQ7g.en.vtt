take<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> look<00:00:02.879> at<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> H&amp;K<00:00:04.009> 417<00:00:05.359> this<00:00:06.359> model

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
take a look at the H&amp;K 417 this model

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.290 
take a look at the H&amp;K 417 this model
rifle<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.099> favorite<00:00:08.700> choice<00:00:08.970> when

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
rifle is one of my favorite choice when

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.839 
rifle is one of my favorite choice when
it<00:00:09.330> comes<00:00:09.599> down<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:10.019> battle<00:00:10.530> rifles<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
it comes down to battle rifles and the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.879 
it comes down to battle rifles and the
reason<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.240> simple<00:00:12.269> many<00:00:12.780> battle<00:00:13.110> rifles<00:00:13.559> are

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
reason is simple many battle rifles are

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.939 
reason is simple many battle rifles are
good<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.610> long<00:00:14.910> range<00:00:15.269> engagements<00:00:15.480> are<00:00:16.289> very

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
good for long range engagements are very

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
good for long range engagements are very
good<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.550> medium<00:00:18.029> range<00:00:18.180> engagements<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
good for medium range engagements and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.109 
good for medium range engagements and
can<00:00:19.560> still<00:00:19.830> perform<00:00:20.070> very<00:00:20.490> good<00:00:20.760> at<00:00:20.910> close

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
can still perform very good at close

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.570 
can still perform very good at close
range<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.960> problem<00:00:22.529> might<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
range and the problem might be the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
range and the problem might be the
weight<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.420> still<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.320> huge<00:00:26.189> weight

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
weight that we still have a huge weight

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.570 
weight that we still have a huge weight
on<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.939> weapon<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.380> recoil<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.310> what's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
on this weapon and the recoil but what's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
on this weapon and the recoil but what's
good<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.300> weapon<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.869> recoil<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
good about this weapon the recoil it's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.910 
good about this weapon the recoil it's
really<00:00:32.160> easy<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> manage<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:34.200> an<00:00:34.530> assault

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
really easy to manage not as an assault

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
really easy to manage not as an assault
rifle<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.489> still<00:00:36.000> something<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.719> can

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
rifle but still something that you can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.290 
rifle but still something that you can
manage<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.950> full-out<00:00:38.280> without<00:00:38.850> boring

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
manage and go full-out without boring

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.650 
manage and go full-out without boring
too<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> say<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.879> let's<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> look

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
too much so say that let's take a look

00:00:42.660 --> 00:01:18.930 
too much so say that let's take a look
at<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> weapon<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> action<00:00:43.469> against<00:00:44.280> zombies

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.610 

this<00:01:19.940> weapon<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.600> my<00:01:20.750> opinion<00:01:21.230> it's<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.590> very

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
this weapon in my opinion it's a very

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.890 
this weapon in my opinion it's a very
good<00:01:22.250> overall<00:01:22.640> weapon<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.480> barrel<00:01:23.780> rifle

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
good overall weapon it's a barrel rifle

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.320 
good overall weapon it's a barrel rifle
very<00:01:24.380> accurate<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.730> medium<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.300> long

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
very accurate the medium to long

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.690 
very accurate the medium to long
distance<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.770> very<00:01:27.980> good<00:01:28.190> for<00:01:28.430> closer

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
distance it's a very good for closer

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580 
distance it's a very good for closer
range<00:01:28.970> because<00:01:29.300> you<00:01:29.420> can<00:01:29.600> drop<00:01:29.780> somebody<00:01:30.080> very

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
range because you can drop somebody very

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.220 
range because you can drop somebody very
easily<00:01:30.890> good<00:01:31.670> rate<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:31.970> fire<00:01:32.120> with<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> recoil

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
easily good rate of fire with the recoil

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.230 
easily good rate of fire with the recoil
that<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.650> manageable<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.760> go<00:01:34.940> full

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
that is manageable so you can go full

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.690 
that is manageable so you can go full
out<00:01:35.480> or<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.710> take<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.220> feeling<00:01:37.610> on

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
out or and if you take the feeling on

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.490 
out or and if you take the feeling on
the<00:01:37.820> gun<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.210> don't<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.750> worry<00:01:38.990> much

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
the gun you don't have to worry much

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.890 
the gun you don't have to worry much
about<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.979> recoil<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.060> my<00:01:41.240> main<00:01:41.479> problem

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
about the recoil but my main problem

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.350 
about the recoil but my main problem
with<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.229> weapon<00:01:42.440> with<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> rifle<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.520> when

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
with this weapon with this rifle is when

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.510 
with this weapon with this rifle is when
you<00:01:44.540> aim<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.050> moving<00:01:45.320> targets<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.280> don't

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
you aim and moving targets and you don't

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520 
you aim and moving targets and you don't
have<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> scope<00:01:47.090> because<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.990> Harmon<00:01:48.290> sight

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
have a scope because the Harmon sight

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.740 
have a scope because the Harmon sight
take<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> lot<00:01:49.130> of<00:01:49.220> visibility<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:50.240> this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
take a lot of visibility you have this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.600 
take a lot of visibility you have this
little<00:01:51.170> circle<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.680> can<00:01:52.009> watch<00:01:52.250> through

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
little circle that you can watch through

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.430 
little circle that you can watch through
so<00:01:53.119> if<00:01:53.210> you're<00:01:53.360> watching<00:01:53.540> your<00:01:53.840> target<00:01:54.290> and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
so if you're watching your target and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.560 
so if you're watching your target and
your<00:01:54.530> target<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.009> not<00:01:55.250> moving<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.330> not<00:01:56.540> a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
your target is not moving this is not a

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.560 
your target is not moving this is not a
problem<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.740> target<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.280> moving<00:01:58.610> very

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
problem but the target is moving very

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.109 
problem but the target is moving very
fast<00:02:00.020> without<00:02:00.619> any<00:02:00.860> weapon<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.729> moving

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
fast without any weapon or just moving

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.499 
fast without any weapon or just moving
you<00:02:03.080> have<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.320> put<00:02:03.560> your<00:02:03.970> weapon<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.090> little<00:02:05.390> bit

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you have to put your weapon a little bit

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.630 
you have to put your weapon a little bit
more<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.200> side<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.740> take<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> little<00:02:07.250> shot

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
more to the side to take a little shot

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
more to the side to take a little shot
and<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.920> order<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.790> when<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.840> do<00:02:12.019> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and in order to do that when you do that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.800 
and in order to do that when you do that
you<00:02:12.410> lose<00:02:12.440> visibility<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.730> your<00:02:13.910> target<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.630> if

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
you lose visibility or your target so if

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
you lose visibility or your target so if
they<00:02:15.050> switch<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> another<00:02:15.709> direction<00:02:16.310> or

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
they switch to another direction or

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.150 
they switch to another direction or
there<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.330> low<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.570> little<00:02:18.019> bit<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.500> won't<00:02:18.830> see

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
there is low a little bit you won't see

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120 
there is low a little bit you won't see
it<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.700> maybe<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.720> will<00:02:20.900> miss<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> shots<00:02:21.590> so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
it and maybe you will miss the shots so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.949 
it and maybe you will miss the shots so
that's<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.610> only<00:02:22.730> problem<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.780> have

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
that's the only problem but if you have

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.040 
that's the only problem but if you have
