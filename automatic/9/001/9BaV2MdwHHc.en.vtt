dollars<00:03:52.849> at<00:03:53.030> wholesale<00:03:54.639> so<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:57.049> know<00:03:57.169> we're

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
dollars at wholesale so you know we're

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.809 
dollars at wholesale so you know we're
not<00:03:57.409> quite<00:03:57.680> at<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.889> half<00:03:58.009> a<00:03:58.129> billion<00:03:58.340> yet<00:03:58.639> but

not quite at the half a billion yet but

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.439 
not quite at the half a billion yet but
we're<00:03:58.970> creeping<00:03:59.479> towards<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:02.180> think

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
we're creeping towards it and I think

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.030 
we're creeping towards it and I think
you<00:04:02.540> know<00:04:02.599> from<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.109> scope<00:04:03.379> perspective<00:04:03.919> it

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
you know from a scope perspective it

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.039 
you know from a scope perspective it
gives<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.280> pretty<00:04:04.430> good<00:04:04.549> idea<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.810> fact

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
