00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
could look like in bare fiber glass

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.560 
could look like in bare fiber glass
before<00:00:12.330> fillers<00:00:13.309> primers<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.020> paint<00:00:16.020> go<00:00:16.529> on

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570

this is Mark Pulaski's sin 1960 car and
as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.680> we've<00:00:22.830> changed<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.400> hood

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
as you can see we've changed the hood

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.839 
as you can see we've changed the hood
surround<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.720> got<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> original<00:00:25.849> color

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to it it was changed at the factory seam

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.350 
to it it was changed at the factory seam
so<00:00:30.390> there's<00:00:30.570> no<00:00:30.779> other<00:00:30.900> seams<00:00:32.090> other<00:00:33.090> than

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so there's no other seams other than

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
so there's no other seams other than
what<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> factory<00:00:34.079> used<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.280> lower<00:00:35.460> valance

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
what the factory used the lower valance
