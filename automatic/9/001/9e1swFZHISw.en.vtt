00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
collection

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.170 
collection
it<00:00:14.580> even<00:00:14.880> has<00:00:15.059> gold-plated<00:00:16.020> eyelets<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.830> it

it even has gold-plated eyelets on it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
it even has gold-plated eyelets on it
but<00:00:18.180> what's<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.600> cool<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
but what's really cool about this is the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
but what's really cool about this is the
quality<00:00:20.520> construction<00:00:21.060> even<00:00:21.510> though<00:00:21.630> these

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
quality construction even though these

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.840 
quality construction even though these
are<00:00:22.020> made<00:00:22.170> overseas<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.859> believe<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.460> quality

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
are made overseas I believe the quality

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630 
are made overseas I believe the quality
construction<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.779> first-rate<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> their

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
construction is first-rate and their

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.279 
construction is first-rate and their
leather<00:00:26.849> line<00:00:27.180> they've<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.689> deerskin

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
leather line they've got deerskin

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.980 
leather line they've got deerskin
leather<00:00:28.560> lining<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
leather lining and so I think this is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
leather lining and so I think this is
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> great<00:00:31.619> shoe<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> end

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
going to be a great shoe and at the end

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
going to be a great shoe and at the end
of<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.149> video<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.870> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
since like the 1930s or some ridiculous

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
since like the 1930s or some ridiculous

nice soul to resist slipping and falling
and<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.799> forth

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and so forth

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.810 
and so forth
good<00:01:54.270> high<00:01:54.450> quality<00:01:54.479> boat<00:01:55.140> shoe<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.610> good

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
way to go and of course the Sperry

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
way to go and of course the Sperry
top-siders<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.450> about<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.079> good<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.619> get

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
top-siders are about as good as they get

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
top-siders are about as good as they get
so<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> definitely<00:02:03.390> recommend<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> take

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
so I definitely recommend that you take

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
so I definitely recommend that you take
a<00:02:04.829> look<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> gold<00:02:05.579> cup<00:02:05.880> series<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a look at the gold cup series I think it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
a look at the gold cup series I think it
is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> step<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> regular<00:02:08.160> Sperry

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
is a step up from the regular Sperry

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.650 
is a step up from the regular Sperry
top-siders

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
top-siders

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.710 
top-siders
and<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.129> will<00:02:11.340> enjoy<00:02:11.730> them<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and I think that you will enjoy them of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.850 
and I think that you will enjoy them of
course<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> regular

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
course the regular

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.280 
course the regular
top-siders<00:02:14.310> might<00:02:15.180> handle<00:02:15.570> getting<00:02:15.750> wet<00:02:16.050> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
top-siders might handle getting wet and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
top-siders might handle getting wet and
drying<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.100> forth<00:02:17.370> easier<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:17.880> they

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
drying and so forth easier because they

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060 
drying and so forth easier because they
don't<00:02:18.240> have<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.540> leather<00:02:18.780> liner<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.530> think

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
don't have that leather liner so think

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.320 
don't have that leather liner so think
about<00:02:20.160> what<00:02:20.430> you're<00:02:20.580> using<00:02:20.760> them<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.240> if

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
about what you're using them for if

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.250 
about what you're using them for if
you're<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:21.600> gonna<00:02:21.750> be<00:02:21.840> using<00:02:21.990> them<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
you're really gonna be using them on a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
you're really gonna be using them on a
boat<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.740> real<00:02:22.920> wet<00:02:23.130> environment<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.850> might

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
boat in a real wet environment you might

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.610 
boat in a real wet environment you might
think<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.630> there<00:02:25.380> are<00:02:25.470> those

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
think about that there are those

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.260 
think about that there are those
timberlands<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.310> told<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.640> about<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.090> these
