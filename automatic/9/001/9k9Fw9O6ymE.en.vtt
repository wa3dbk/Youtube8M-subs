live<00:02:00.360> longer<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
live longer now I you're right but I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
live longer now I you're right but I
like<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:05.040> considering<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
like to think that at considering the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.020 
like to think that at considering the
study<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> over<00:02:06.710> 65,000<00:02:07.710> people<00:02:07.860> yeah<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
study of over 65,000 people yeah I that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.729 
study of over 65,000 people yeah I that
there's<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.450> validity<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.560> of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
there's some validity to this and of

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.080 
there's some validity to this and of
course<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.580> either<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.819> us<00:02:12.030> would

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
course I don't think either of us would

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
course I don't think either of us would
argue<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.780> eating<00:02:13.290> more<00:02:13.500> fruits<00:02:13.770> in

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
argue that eating more fruits in

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.400 
argue that eating more fruits in
vegetables<00:02:14.430> uh<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.390> part<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.959> daily<00:02:16.110> diet

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
vegetables uh as part of your daily diet

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.760 
vegetables uh as part of your daily diet
will<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.430> huge<00:02:18.239> health<00:02:18.750> benefit<00:02:19.260> well<00:02:19.739> I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
will have a huge health benefit well I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.380 
will have a huge health benefit well I
think<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.880> don't<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.360> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
think that we don't know that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.330 
think that we don't know that
necessarily<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.590> study<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> other

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
necessarily from this study the other

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.979 
necessarily from this study the other
the<00:02:23.760> other<00:02:23.790> question<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> study

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the other question I have with the study

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.870 
the other question I have with the study
is<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.319> is<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> baseline<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
is what is the baseline right all of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
is what is the baseline right all of
these<00:02:27.060> numbers<00:02:27.620> talk<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.220> risk<00:02:29.520> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
these numbers talk about your risk of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
these numbers talk about your risk of
death<00:02:30.170> relative<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.200> having<00:02:31.739> less<00:02:32.040> than<00:02:32.370> one

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
death relative to having less than one

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.790 
death relative to having less than one
serving<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.390> fruits<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.930> vegetables<00:02:34.500> each

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
serving of fruits and vegetables each

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.990 
serving of fruits and vegetables each
day<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:36.180> relative<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:38.000> increases

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
day and that relative to that increases

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.430 
day and that relative to that increases
in<00:02:39.150> fruit<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.569> vegetable<00:02:40.050> consumption

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
in fruit and vegetable consumption

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.710 
in fruit and vegetable consumption
reduce<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.100> risk<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.459> death<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
reduce your risk of death but that's the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.050 
reduce your risk of death but that's the
question<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.349> ask<00:02:43.590> our<00:02:44.010> most<00:02:44.700> people

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
question we have to ask our most people

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.960 
question we have to ask our most people
eating<00:02:45.569> less<00:02:46.290> than<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.830> serving<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.550> both

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
eating less than one serving of both

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.420 
eating less than one serving of both
fruits<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.660> vegetables<00:02:49.230> combined<00:02:49.800> per<00:02:50.160> day<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
fruits and vegetables combined per day I

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.090 
fruits and vegetables combined per day I
know<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.450> probably<00:02:51.900> know<00:02:52.290> people<00:02:52.680> who

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
know we all probably know people who

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.979 
know we all probably know people who
don't<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.549> vegetables<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.330> probably<00:02:54.690> don't

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
don't like vegetables and probably don't

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.170 
don't like vegetables and probably don't
eat<00:02:55.110> too<00:02:55.230> many<00:02:55.350> fruits<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.910> really

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
eat too many fruits but is it really

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180 
eat too many fruits but is it really
true<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.049> baseline<00:02:58.620> here<00:02:58.980> should<00:02:59.160> be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
true that the baseline here should be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.210 
true that the baseline here should be
compared<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.910> eating<00:03:00.299> none<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.780> those<00:03:00.989> things

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
compared to eating none of those things

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.130 
compared to eating none of those things
people<00:03:02.220> who<00:03:02.340> are<00:03:02.489> eating<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:03.450> fruits<00:03:03.930> or

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
people who are eating no fruits or

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.949 
people who are eating no fruits or
vegetables<00:03:04.319> each<00:03:04.950> day<00:03:05.150> probably<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.720> very

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
vegetables each day probably are in very

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.960 
vegetables each day probably are in very
specific<00:03:07.519> situations<00:03:08.519> where<00:03:08.790> they're

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
specific situations where they're

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330 
specific situations where they're
unhealthy<00:03:09.330> for<00:03:09.750> other<00:03:09.900> reasons<00:03:10.230> maybe<00:03:11.130> we

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
unhealthy for other reasons maybe we

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.699 
unhealthy for other reasons maybe we
should<00:03:11.370> also<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.910> looking<00:03:12.180> at<00:03:12.480> one<00:03:13.350> or<00:03:13.500> two

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
should also be looking at one or two

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
should also be looking at one or two
servings<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> baseline<00:03:14.880> which<00:03:15.239> would

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
servings as a baseline which would

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.289 
servings as a baseline which would
radically<00:03:15.660> change<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.260> numbers<00:03:17.000> that's<00:03:18.000> true

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
radically change the numbers that's true

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.360 
radically change the numbers that's true
I<00:03:18.329> guess<00:03:18.510> what<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.140> what<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.739> average<00:03:19.890> what

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
I guess what is what is the average what

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.090 
I guess what is what is the average what
do<00:03:20.640> most<00:03:20.820> people<00:03:21.030> consume<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.560> any<00:03:22.739> given<00:03:22.950> day

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
do most people consume on any given day

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.640 
do most people consume on any given day
I<00:03:23.519> don't<00:03:24.030> really<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.750> remember<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
I don't really know and remember the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.680 
I don't really know and remember the
last<00:03:25.950> thing<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.459> also<00:03:26.640> should<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.120> considering

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
last thing we also should be considering

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.630 
last thing we also should be considering
is<00:03:27.930> even<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.560> were<00:03:28.829> able<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.489> establish

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
is even if we were able to establish

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.479 
is even if we were able to establish
causation<00:03:30.540> beyond<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.170> reasonable<00:03:31.200> doubt<00:03:31.709> at

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
causation beyond a reasonable doubt at

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.340 
causation beyond a reasonable doubt at
what<00:03:32.880> point<00:03:33.180> does<00:03:33.420> adding<00:03:33.810> more<00:03:34.019> fruit<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
what point does adding more fruit and

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.069 
what point does adding more fruit and
vegetables<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.459> your<00:03:35.579> diet<00:03:35.850> not<00:03:36.540> provide<00:03:36.930> any

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
vegetables to your diet not provide any

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.539 
vegetables to your diet not provide any
additional<00:03:37.320> benefit<00:03:38.130> if<00:03:38.250> you're<00:03:38.400> already

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
additional benefit if you're already

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.390 
additional benefit if you're already
having<00:03:38.910> 15<00:03:39.540> servings<00:03:39.930> will<00:03:40.829> having<00:03:41.220> an

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
having 15 servings will having an

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.390 
having 15 servings will having an
additional<00:03:41.700> 3<00:03:42.500> continue<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.680> reduce<00:03:44.130> your

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
additional 3 continue to reduce your

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.520 
additional 3 continue to reduce your
risk<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.000> death<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.720> get<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> point<00:03:46.350> of

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
risk of death we we get to a point of

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.729 
risk of death we we get to a point of
diminishing<00:03:46.709> marginal<00:03:47.130> utility<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.329> uh<00:03:48.739> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
diminishing marginal utility and uh that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.650 
diminishing marginal utility and uh that
that<00:03:49.769> also<00:03:50.340> needs<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.640> be<00:03:50.850> considered<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.540> an

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that also needs to be considered so an
