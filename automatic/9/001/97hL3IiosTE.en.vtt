00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
so let's take a look around the case

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
so let's take a look around the case
when<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> first<00:00:37.230> took<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> out<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> packaging<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
when I first took it out the packaging I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.900 
when I first took it out the packaging I
wasn't<00:00:38.940> 100%<00:00:39.149> happy<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> desire<00:00:40.260> but

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
wasn't 100% happy with the desire but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
wasn't 100% happy with the desire but
admittedly<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.420> has<00:00:42.660> grown<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
admittedly it has grown on me one of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
admittedly it has grown on me one of the
nicest<00:00:44.399> things<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.940> find<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.690> little

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
nicest things I find is this little

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.779 
nicest things I find is this little
statement<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.770> sort<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.460> hair<00:00:47.760> like

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
statement that sort of has hair like

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.940 
statement that sort of has hair like
mine<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> Monday<00:00:48.780> morning<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
mine on a Monday morning and it is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.990 
mine on a Monday morning and it is
Monday<00:00:50.250> which<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> reason<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.969> not

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
Monday which is the reason I'm not

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
Monday which is the reason I'm not
appearing<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.539> camera<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
appearing on camera now let's take a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.350 
appearing on camera now let's take a
look<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> stitching<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.969> well<00:00:54.120> because

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
look at the stitching as well because

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
look at the stitching as well because
the<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.289> been<00:00:55.410> stitched<00:00:55.879> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the way that this has been stitched you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510 
the way that this has been stitched you
know<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.629> adds<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> design<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.309> I'm

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
know it just adds to the design and I'm

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240 
know it just adds to the design and I'm
really<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.690> liking<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.559> patterns<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really really liking the patterns that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
really really liking the patterns that
they've<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.609> onto<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.000> case<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.320> how

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
they've put onto this case and just how

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
they've put onto this case and just how
unique<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.790> others<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
unique it is from others now the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
unique it is from others now the
peculiar<00:01:07.260> logo<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.650> also<00:01:08.040> pretty<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.490> out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
peculiar logo is also pretty much out

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
peculiar logo is also pretty much out
the<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.810> case<00:01:09.990> itself<00:01:10.439> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the way it's not on the case itself it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.850 
the way it's not on the case itself it's
hanging<00:01:11.670> by<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> side<00:01:12.439> let's<00:01:13.439> take<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> look

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
take you a couple of days to figure that

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.240 
take you a couple of days to figure that
out<00:02:38.629> or<00:02:38.989> if<00:02:39.349> you're<00:02:39.439> just<00:02:39.500> about<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.829> buy<00:02:40.040> one

I've<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:41.030> shown<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.959> laptop<00:02:42.260> although

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
I've just shown you this laptop although

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.280 
I've just shown you this laptop although
it's<00:02:43.219> probably<00:02:43.489> too<00:02:43.879> tight<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.659> get<00:02:44.810> much<00:02:45.049> in

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it's probably too tight to get much in

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.869 
it's probably too tight to get much in
there<00:02:45.499> but<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.889> have<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.129> notepad<00:02:46.489> or

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
there but if you have a notepad or

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.879 
there but if you have a notepad or
anything<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:48.169> can<00:02:48.349> slide<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.799> in

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
anything like that you can slide it in

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.770 
anything like that you can slide it in
there<00:02:48.919> along<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.730> whatever<00:02:50.090> may<00:02:50.419> be<00:02:50.480> your

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
there along with whatever may be your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.689 
there along with whatever may be your
laptop<00:02:51.379> charger<00:02:51.739> might<00:02:51.919> just<00:02:52.219> fit<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.519> there

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699 
laptop charger might just fit in there

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.929 
laptop charger might just fit in there
but<00:02:53.389> it's<00:02:53.629> definitely<00:02:53.959> definitely<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:55.099> well

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
but it's definitely definitely a well

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.179 
but it's definitely definitely a well
packed<00:02:56.389> compartment<00:02:57.109> that<00:02:57.230> goes<00:02:57.349> all<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.650> way

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
packed compartment that goes all the way

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.339 
packed compartment that goes all the way
to<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.030> back<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.329> case<00:02:59.569> so<00:02:59.810> maybe<00:03:00.109> you

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
to the back of the case so maybe you

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.839 
to the back of the case so maybe you
could<00:03:00.530> get<00:03:00.680> your<00:03:00.859> laptop<00:03:01.010> charger<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.669> there

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
could get your laptop charger in there

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.759 
could get your laptop charger in there
if<00:03:02.419> not<00:03:02.719> if<00:03:02.959> your<00:03:03.079> laptop's<00:03:03.409> got<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> good

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
if not if your laptop's got a good

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.220 
if not if your laptop's got a good
battery<00:03:04.189> life<00:03:04.219> like<00:03:04.699> mine<00:03:05.000> has<00:03:05.299> then<00:03:06.049> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
battery life like mine has then a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.979 
battery life like mine has then a
notepad<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> book<00:03:07.340> will<00:03:07.819> definitely<00:03:08.569> fit<00:03:08.810> in

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
notepad or a book will definitely fit in

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.170 
notepad or a book will definitely fit in
