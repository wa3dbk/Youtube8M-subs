00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
for both energy and water and has 201 HP

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.540 
for both energy and water and has 201 HP
bad<00:00:41.960> not<00:00:42.230> bad<00:00:42.440> not<00:00:42.680> bad<00:00:42.710> he's<00:00:43.130> so<00:00:43.309> adorable

okay<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.410> rainbow<00:00:45.800> dragon<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.340> an<00:00:46.580> energy

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
okay so the rainbow dragon is an energy

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.620 
okay so the rainbow dragon is an energy
and<00:00:47.240> a<00:00:47.630> water<00:00:47.930> dragon<00:00:48.670> so<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.150> the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
and a water dragon so we know that the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.450 
and a water dragon so we know that the
energy<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:51.170> water<00:00:51.260> dragons<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.980> eel<00:00:52.100> dragon

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
energy and water dragons the eel dragon

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.040 
energy and water dragons the eel dragon
I<00:00:52.520> showed<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.880> in<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.970> previous<00:00:53.000> video<00:00:53.420> how<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
I showed you in a previous video how to

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.750 
I showed you in a previous video how to
get<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> eel<00:00:54.500> dragon<00:00:54.950> but<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.280> easiest<00:00:55.670> way

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
get the eel dragon but the easiest way

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.520 
get the eel dragon but the easiest way
to<00:00:55.880> get<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.210> would<00:00:56.330> just<00:00:56.540> be<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.780> breed<00:00:57.140> water

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
to get it would just be to breed water

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.070 
to get it would just be to breed water
and<00:00:57.830> energy<00:00:58.070> together<00:00:58.580> however<00:00:59.210> since<00:00:59.930> the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
and energy together however since the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.290 
and energy together however since the
rainbow<00:01:00.440> dragon<00:01:00.620> also<00:01:01.160> has<00:01:01.310> energy<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.790> water

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
rainbow dragon also has energy and water

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.749 
rainbow dragon also has energy and water
element<00:01:02.900> you<00:01:03.440> may<00:01:03.620> not<00:01:03.890> get<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:04.339> could<00:01:04.579> get

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
element you may not get it you could get

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.520 
element you may not get it you could get
it<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.970> same<00:01:05.180> way<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:05.449> I'm<00:01:06.110> gonna<00:01:06.290> show<00:01:06.470> you

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
it the same way but I'm gonna show you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.240 
it the same way but I'm gonna show you
the<00:01:06.680> way<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.829> got<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.750> okay<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.860> picture

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
the way I got it okay so the picture

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.609 
the way I got it okay so the picture
here<00:01:10.579> shows<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.420> bred<00:01:11.720> my<00:01:11.900> honey<00:01:12.110> dragon

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
here shows that I bred my honey dragon

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.350 
here shows that I bred my honey dragon
with<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.189> eel<00:01:13.340> dragon<00:01:13.729> himself<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.329> I

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
with the eel dragon himself and I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.420 
with the eel dragon himself and I
figured<00:01:14.720> okay<00:01:14.990> since<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.470> eel<00:01:15.619> dragon<00:01:16.189> is<00:01:16.369> a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
figured okay since the eel dragon is a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.940 
figured okay since the eel dragon is a
water<00:01:16.850> energy<00:01:17.299> I'm<00:01:17.810> going<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.140> use<00:01:18.350> him<00:01:18.649> with

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
water energy I'm going to use him with

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.719 
water energy I'm going to use him with
another<00:01:19.189> dragon<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.310> energy<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.340> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
another dragon that is the energy of the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.529 
another dragon that is the energy of the
energy<00:01:23.119> element<00:01:23.569> and<00:01:24.109> I<00:01:24.499> just<00:01:25.270> guessed

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
energy element and I just guessed

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.749 
energy element and I just guessed
really<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.170> decided<00:01:27.979> okay<00:01:28.310> let's<00:01:28.520> see<00:01:28.639> what

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
really and decided okay let's see what

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.069 
really and decided okay let's see what
happens<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.240> know<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.630> even<00:01:29.810> though<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
happens I know that even though the

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.020 
happens I know that even though the
honey<00:01:30.229> dragon<00:01:30.649> isn't<00:01:30.979> really<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> rare<00:01:31.789> or

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
honey dragon isn't really a rare or

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.080 
honey dragon isn't really a rare or
uncommon<00:01:32.659> dragon<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:34.310> kind<00:01:34.609> of<00:01:34.670> up<00:01:34.819> there

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
uncommon dragon it's kind of up there

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.730 
uncommon dragon it's kind of up there
because<00:01:35.569> look<00:01:35.719> it's<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.109> more<00:01:36.229> expensive

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
because look it's it's more expensive

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.349 
because look it's it's more expensive
than<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.889> other<00:01:37.039> energy<00:01:37.219> one<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:38.090> just

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
than the other energy one so that just

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.359 
than the other energy one so that just
means<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.020> kind<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:39.319> probably<00:01:39.859> harder

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
means that it's kind of probably harder

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.669 
means that it's kind of probably harder
to<00:01:40.520> get<00:01:40.670> them<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.969> others<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.959> know<00:01:42.109> common

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
to get them the others you know common

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.919 
to get them the others you know common
sense<00:01:42.889> if<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:43.249> more<00:01:43.399> expensive<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.060> yeah

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
sense if it's more expensive and yeah

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.569 
sense if it's more expensive and yeah
you<00:01:45.170> get<00:01:45.319> it<00:01:45.409> anyways<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.659> um<00:01:47.659> yeah<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.829> mean<00:01:49.130> you

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
you get it anyways so um yeah I mean you

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:50.859 
you get it anyways so um yeah I mean you
still<00:01:49.819> breed<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.209> plant<00:01:50.420> energy<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
still breed with plant energy but you

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.419 
still breed with plant energy but you
get<00:01:50.990> what<00:01:51.079> I'm<00:01:51.170> saying<00:01:51.229> okay<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.069> bred<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
get what I'm saying okay so I bred the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.580 
get what I'm saying okay so I bred the
honey<00:01:52.579> dragon<00:01:52.969> with<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.299> eel<00:01:53.450> dragon<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.229> it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
honey dragon with the eel dragon and it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.219 
honey dragon with the eel dragon and it
turns<00:01:54.799> out<00:01:55.039> that<00:01:55.909> whoa<00:01:57.729> okay<00:01:59.049> scared<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.109> crap

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
dragon looks like a bush dragon you know

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.529 
dragon looks like a bush dragon you know
with<00:02:05.029> the<00:02:05.149> vines<00:02:06.109> and<00:02:06.499> anyways<00:02:06.829> yes<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.240> when<00:02:08.509> I
