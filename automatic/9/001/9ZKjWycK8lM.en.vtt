two truck teams and we have two

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.549 
two truck teams and we have two
architects<00:01:00.909> so<00:01:01.600> every<00:01:01.900> week<00:01:02.110> we<00:01:02.320> have<00:01:02.500> a

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
architects so every week we have a

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.130 
architects so every week we have a
massive<00:01:03.489> amount<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.970> cars<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.570> get<00:01:04.750> ready<00:01:04.960> if

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
massive amount of cars to get ready if

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.960 
massive amount of cars to get ready if
you<00:01:05.290> figure<00:01:05.590> each<00:01:05.770> team<00:01:06.070> takes<00:01:06.340> two<00:01:06.550> cars<00:01:06.820> to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
you figure each team takes two cars to

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.359 
you figure each team takes two cars to
the<00:01:07.090> track<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.659> have<00:01:07.750> 16<00:01:08.259> cars<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:09.250> have

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
the track so we have 16 cars that have

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.100 
the track so we have 16 cars that have
to<00:01:09.490> be<00:01:09.580> prepared<00:01:09.909> every<00:01:10.180> week<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.720> prepare<00:01:10.990> for
