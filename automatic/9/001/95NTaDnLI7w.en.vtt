00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.270
 come on hi welcome everyone for 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.100
 a new video in which we see 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.330
 talk about call of duty black ops 3 and on 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.700
 will talk about the game's engine today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 and no no no no I will tell them I will 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 will say again and again there will not be 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.860
 new graphics engine or two 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 global engines on call of duty black 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 ops 3 and there will never be why 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 simply because it's a lot 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.789
 too complicated much too much work 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.720
 to create an engine from the web since 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 the beginning simply 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.630
 and it will not happen but against this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.830
 that they can do is improve the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 existing engine as they do each 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 year or every 2 to 3 years depending 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.230
 developers is the best and I 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.550
 think this year we will see a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.559
 improvement that is going to be really very 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 significant since it will touch the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.350
 brakes brown ding so what is that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 it's freelancing is everything 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 simply translates the rounding on the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 images ie the engine of the game 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.510
 current which is an engine derived from 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 the tech idea that is derived from the quake 3 and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 jean et cetera and so on not you do 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 all the engine history of the game but 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 this engine works by image or by 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.230
 frame a frame it's an image and so 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 the engine works by frame it's up to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.280
 say that at each frame calculation the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 engine will be able to do an action it does not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 can not do any action between two 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.610
 calculations ie that for example the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.229
 engine will only be able to shoot a bullet 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.180
 when he calculates the next image 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.340
 that is, we will have problems 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.439
 for example between two firing rate 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.150
 on weapons we will have problems of 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.619
 speed of moving problems of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 height of jumps for example on call of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 duty 4 the promod was created with 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.020
 on pc fps that were blocked at 125 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.159
 images per second simply because 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 that when we go beyond gold we 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 could go to 250 to 333 images 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 per second for example the game engine 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.140
 allowed to do jumps which is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 who was not allowed any 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 simply 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 so suddenly they limited this fps to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 125 images second 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.060
 now what they want to do 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.649
 treyarch withdrew just that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 so in what sense do they want to remove 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.470
 that they want what they want to withdraw 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.329
 only for shot rates 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.649
 weapons only for movements 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.730
 it's not important because 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.290
 only for fine movements 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 remove it for movements that's fine 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.530
 not change the whole game honestly 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.180
 really nothing changed against the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.800
 withdraw for the cadences of arms it's going 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.000
 to do that changed a lot of things 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.360
 and I will give you an example all 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.700
 simple a weapon for example that pulling at 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 857 bullet per minute should shoot 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.320
 normally a ball all 0.1 0.7 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 second at 0.07 seconds at 60 frames per 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.530
 second is that 4.2 images it wants 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.520
 say that the ball should be fired a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.200
 once every four 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.540
 two images the problem is that the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.310
 current engine does not support that 4.2 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 picture do not see me the comma of he has 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.880
 bounced above say that category 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.230
 will arrive at 4 th and 10 sailing bombs at 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.970
 the next bullet she will shoot the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.240
 next picture that makes this weapon 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.410
 or shooting at 857 pull it all out 4.2 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.090
 picture she will shoot all five 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.470
 pictures what told me what will give 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.190
 simply a cadence that is going to be 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.690
 reduced from 857 to 720 bullet per minute and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 if we globalize all that on the whole is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 most cadences of the weapons of 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.380
 call of 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.940
 we just end up with six 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.070
 other weapons a rate between 900 and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.550
 1100 99 bales a minute it's going to be 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.560
 rounded to 906 it is between 720 and 899 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 to gonna be rounded to 720 and if it is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.490
 between 600 and 700 19 she will be rounded 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.400
 at 600 which simply makes 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.260
 take the example of the gold la cbi jms 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.070
 on call of duty ghost on console at 60 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.590
 frames per second 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.730
 the ascb jms his quick shot was at 9 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
 cents and wheelbarrows shot by bullets 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 per minute and with fast ti it goes up 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 at 1100 something the problem is 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
 that both were between 900 and 1200 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.209
 with and without quick shots 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.010
 two shot exactly at the same pace 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.660
 which was 900 bullet per minute and that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 it was a big problem and treyarch 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.050
 account solve this problem in black 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.800
 ops what is it really a very very 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.180
 good thing 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.380
 how they will solve I do not know it 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.910
 there are several methods anyway 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.110
 but I hope in any case that it's okay 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.520
 really be resolved and that's really 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.330
 a very very good thing about this I you 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.440
 leave and there I wish you 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.730
 a good day and the match would have and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.510
 we will meet again next time 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.510
 go ciao
