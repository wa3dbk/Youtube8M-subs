normal touching machine which moves for
a<00:00:58.350> power<00:00:58.649> supply<00:00:58.969> this<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.719> run<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
a power supply this one is run off of my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030 
a power supply this one is run off of my
remote<00:01:02.190> control<00:01:02.219> car<00:01:03.350> which<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:04.710> took

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
remote control car which basically took

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.109 
remote control car which basically took
the<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> make<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.760> when<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> press

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the bit to make me and when you press

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
the bit to make me and when you press
this<00:01:09.360> button<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> rules<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:13.049> look

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this button here it rules makes me look

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
this button here it rules makes me look
like<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
like that as you can see it went up and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.460 
like that as you can see it went up and
down<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:17.640> sends<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> signal<00:01:18.659> from<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
down and it sends a signal from the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.020 
down and it sends a signal from the
remote<00:01:19.680> control<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.530> small<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
remote control so this small to this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.859 
remote control so this small to this
small<00:01:24.299> box<00:01:24.650> can<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> receive<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.600> we've<00:01:27.600> sent

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
small box can you receive it we've sent

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.380 
small box can you receive it we've sent
a<00:01:27.960> signal<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> speed<00:01:28.890> controller<00:01:29.640> which

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
a signal to the speed controller which

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.289 
a signal to the speed controller which
is<00:01:30.540> why<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.049> offer<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> speed<00:01:31.759> which<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is why you can offer the speed which in

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.440 
is why you can offer the speed which in
turn<00:01:33.979> gets<00:01:34.979> power<00:01:35.280> from<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> battery<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.030> run

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
turn gets power from the battery to run

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.770 
turn gets power from the battery to run
the<00:01:36.570> motor<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.680> basically<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.119> remote

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the motor so basically it is a remote

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.609 
the motor so basically it is a remote
control<00:01:40.229> car<00:01:40.530> without<00:01:41.100> wheels<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.619> remote

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
control car without wheels and remote

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
control car without wheels and remote
controls<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> machine<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.729> lots<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.030> toys

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
controls as a machine with lots of toys

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.840 
controls as a machine with lots of toys
happy<00:01:45.479> machine<00:01:45.899> indeed<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:47.729> works<00:01:48.710> by

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
happy machine indeed and it works by

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
happy machine indeed and it works by
dipping<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.119> ink<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> Indian<00:01:52.920> ink

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
dipping it in ink this is Indian ink

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.219 
dipping it in ink this is Indian ink
which<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.790> from<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.119> local<00:01:54.479> station<00:01:54.899> shop

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
which we got from the local station shop

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
which we got from the local station shop
dip<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.719> see

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
dip it in like that and then you can see

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.249 
dip it in like that and then you can see
that<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.200> completely<00:01:58.649> bare<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.869> I'll

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that with completely bare and now I'll

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:30.520 
that with completely bare and now I'll
do<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> soon

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.570 

but<00:02:31.530> people<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:35.150> YouTube<00:02:36.150> made<00:02:36.390> it
