guide on how to get signage mod 12
working<00:04:47.199> on<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:48.340> Stockholm<00:04:49.240> slot<00:04:49.530> which<00:04:50.530> is

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
working on the Stockholm slot which is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040 
working on the Stockholm slot which is
actually<00:04:51.550> pretty<00:04:51.789> cool<00:04:52.240> because<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.900> get

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
actually pretty cool because you get

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.550 
actually pretty cool because you get
better<00:04:53.770> ram<00:04:54.310> handling<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:55.630> better<00:04:56.020> um

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
better ram handling and better um

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.379 
better ram handling and better um
storage<00:04:58.620> storage<00:05:00.090> administration<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.210> the

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
storage storage administration of the

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.930 
storage storage administration of the
device<00:05:01.720> so<00:05:02.220> everything<00:05:03.220> will<00:05:03.550> be<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.759> lot

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
device so everything will be a lot

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.700 
device so everything will be a lot
smoother<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:06.430> have<00:05:06.580> more<00:05:06.849> space<00:05:07.710> more

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
smoother and you have more space more

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.860 
smoother and you have more space more
user<00:05:08.949> space<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:10.180> can<00:05:10.300> download<00:05:10.509> more<00:05:10.810> apps

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
user space you can download more apps

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.529 
user space you can download more apps
and<00:05:11.289> don't<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.580> mess<00:05:12.789> around<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.360> T

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
and don't have to mess around the T

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.219 
and don't have to mess around the T
cache<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:15.120> when<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.240> create<00:05:16.419> your<00:05:16.599> own<00:05:16.870> slot
