kind of know what to sit people when
they<00:00:27.119> ask<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.449> pc<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> gaming<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
they ask you about pc is in gaming and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.529 
they ask you about pc is in gaming and
stuff<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> first<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.060> guys<00:00:30.269> is

stuff like that so the first one guys is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.680 
stuff like that so the first one guys is
you<00:00:30.840> need<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.170> i7<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.890> gaming<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.450> look<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you need an i7 for gaming and look you

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
you need an i7 for gaming and look you
really<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.200> need<00:00:34.350> an<00:00:34.469> i7<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:35.010> gaming<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
really do not need an i7 for gaming and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.280 
really do not need an i7 for gaming and
a<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:35.969> good<00:00:36.090> example<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> fact

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
a really good example this is the fact

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
a really good example this is the fact
that<00:00:37.350> i<00:00:37.620> don't<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.190> an<00:00:38.280> i7<00:00:38.430> i<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.149> i5

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that i don't have an i7 i have an i5

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
that i don't have an i7 i have an i5
mine<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.620> quad<00:00:40.829> core<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.700> got<00:00:41.879> actual

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
mine is a quad core and it's got actual

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
mine is a quad core and it's got actual
four<00:00:42.420> threads<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.320> even

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
four threads as well so it's not even

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.250 
four threads as well so it's not even
hyper<00:00:43.739> threaded<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.309> i<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> fine<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.170> play

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
hyper threaded and i do fine I can play

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
hyper threaded and i do fine I can play
battlefield<00:00:46.890> titanfall<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> stuff

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
battlefield titanfall all kind of stuff

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.220 
battlefield titanfall all kind of stuff
1080p<00:00:49.620> maximum<00:00:50.309> settings<00:00:50.670> move<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.870> well

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
1080p maximum settings move with well

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.490 
1080p maximum settings move with well
over<00:00:52.260> 60<00:00:52.860> FPS<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.879> yeah<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.350> not

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
over 60 FPS so yeah you really do not

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.250 
over 60 FPS so yeah you really do not
need<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:56.039> i7<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> end<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> deer

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
need an i7 at all at the end of the deer

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
need an i7 at all at the end of the deer
if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.699> more<00:00:59.789> expensive<00:01:00.270> CPU

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
if you do go for more expensive CPU

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.689 
if you do go for more expensive CPU
that's<00:01:00.989> good<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.620> not<00:01:01.710> essential<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that's good but it's not essential at

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.440 
that's good but it's not essential at
all<00:01:03.000> second<00:01:03.870> question<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.790> what<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.150> kind

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
all second question is what it is kind

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
all second question is what it is kind
of<00:01:06.479> stem<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> honest<00:01:07.290> higher<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.100> wattage

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
of stem to be honest higher the wattage

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750 
of stem to be honest higher the wattage
on<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.670> psu<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.510> better<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.430> that's<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
on a psu the better and that's kind of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
on a psu the better and that's kind of
not<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> guys<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> comes<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
not through the guys when it comes to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
not through the guys when it comes to
power<00:01:13.860> supplies<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> getting<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> higher<00:01:15.840> watt

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
power supplies and getting a higher watt

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
power supplies and getting a higher watt
power<00:01:16.380> supply<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:17.009> needed<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.580> you're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
power supply is needed when you're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
power supply is needed when you're
putting<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> components<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.259> when

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
putting a lot of components in or when

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.780 
putting a lot of components in or when
you<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.770> you're<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> grid<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you know you're going to grid in the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.429 
you know you're going to grid in the
future<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> end<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> day<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
future but at the end of the day and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
future but at the end of the day and
it's<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> efficiency

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's all going to do with the efficiency

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's all going to do with the efficiency
and<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> actual<00:01:24.780> power<00:01:25.170> curve<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> say<00:01:27.450> if

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and the actual power curve and so say if

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.469 
and the actual power curve and so say if
you<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.640> 1000<00:01:29.640> watt<00:01:29.759> power<00:01:29.970> supply<00:01:30.000> are

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you get up a 1000 watt power supply are

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
you get up a 1000 watt power supply are
you<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.659> using<00:01:30.869> 500<00:01:31.860> watts<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.970> very

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you only using 500 watts that's not very

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700 
you only using 500 watts that's not very
efficient<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.900> power<00:01:34.020> supply<00:01:34.170> won't<00:01:34.530> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
efficient and your power supply won't be

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.100 
efficient and your power supply won't be
working<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> its<00:01:35.430> best<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.509> PAP<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
working to its best and it all PAP and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
working to its best and it all PAP and
you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you know what it's going to do is then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
you know what it's going to do is then
get<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.509> power<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> wall<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.470> not

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
get more power from the wall I'm not

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.810 
get more power from the wall I'm not
really<00:01:40.799> using<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> wasted

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
really using and it's going to be wasted

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
really using and it's going to be wasted
on<00:01:42.119> noise<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> healey<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:42.990> stuff<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
on noise and healey and stuff like that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.069 
on noise and healey and stuff like that
now<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:44.610> notice<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.630> these

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
now what you'll notice is that these

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
now what you'll notice is that these
platinum<00:01:46.560> rated<00:01:46.860> power<00:01:47.009> supplies<00:01:47.430> are<00:01:47.729> more

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
platinum rated power supplies are more

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
platinum rated power supplies are more
efficient<00:01:48.990> full<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> role<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.759> terms<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
efficient full of a role and in terms of

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the system load so say if you know

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.830 
the system load so say if you know
you're<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.430> using<00:01:53.579> 600<00:01:54.360> watts<00:01:54.600> from

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you're going to be using 600 watts from

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
you're going to be using 600 watts from
your<00:01:54.960> PC<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.890> 700<00:01:56.610> watt<00:01:56.759> something<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.299> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
your PC is 700 watt something like that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
your PC is 700 watt something like that
and<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> needing<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.860> going

future-proof you can just get something

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
future-proof you can just get something
like<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.930> expensive<00:02:13.200> mobile

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
like a more expensive mobile

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.589 
like a more expensive mobile
I'll<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.310> slots<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.819> grid<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.269> future

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
I'll have slots to grid in the future

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.180 
I'll have slots to grid in the future
you<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.959> thats<00:02:16.230> future<00:02:16.440> proofing<00:02:16.950> it's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you know thats future proofing it's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.850 
you know thats future proofing it's
where<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.019> able<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.319> grid<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
where you will be able to grid in the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.649 
where you will be able to grid in the
future<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.120> pipe<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.330> you're<00:02:21.569> not

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
future and it's a pipe that you're not

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.720 
future and it's a pipe that you're not
having<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.319> just<00:02:22.620> bring<00:02:22.860> your<00:02:23.069> pc<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.459> by

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
having to just bring your pc and by

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.220 
having to just bring your pc and by
uniform<00:02:24.150> there's<00:02:24.330> else<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.599> downright<00:02:24.930> silly

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
uniform there's else is downright silly

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
uniform there's else is downright silly
so<00:02:25.739> upgrading<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.879> big<00:02:27.480> part<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.810> PCs<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.409> at

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so upgrading is a big part of PCs and at

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.289 
so upgrading is a big part of PCs and at
the<00:02:29.340> end<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.580> day<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.090> want

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the end of the day you don't really want

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.330 
the end of the day you don't really want
to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.390> being<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.349> know<00:02:31.379> throwing<00:02:31.799> away<00:02:32.069> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to be being in you know throwing away a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
to be being in you know throwing away a
pc<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.090> buying<00:02:33.269> completing<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.260> that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
pc and buying completing you want that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
pc and buying completing you want that
gets<00:02:34.560> us<00:02:34.680> Siddalee<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.209> want

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
gets us Siddalee because when you want

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.240 
gets us Siddalee because when you want
to<00:02:36.390> look<00:02:36.480> grid<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.530> certain<00:02:37.799> aspects

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
to look grid it is just certain aspects

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520 
to look grid it is just certain aspects
like<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.610> CPU<00:02:39.299> or<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.720> GPU<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.379> can

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
like that CPU or the GPU that you can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
like that CPU or the GPU that you can
look<00:02:40.680> grid<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.160> stuff<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:42.329> by

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
look grid and stuff like that so by

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.630 
look grid and stuff like that so by
getting<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.590> motherboard<00:02:44.099> that's<00:02:44.340> just

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
getting you know motherboard that's just

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.369 
getting you know motherboard that's just
a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.970> bit<00:02:45.090> more<00:02:45.269> expensive<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
a little bit more expensive you can have

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.559 
a little bit more expensive you can have
more<00:02:46.560> slots<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.519> know<00:02:47.640> probably<00:02:47.970> how

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
more slots at all you know probably how

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.559 
more slots at all you know probably how

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.280 
that are you to know by a cpu next year
that<00:03:06.239> i'll<00:03:06.329> be<00:03:06.359> found<00:03:06.629> out<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.810> know<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> next

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
that i'll be found out you know the next

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.460 
that i'll be found out you know the next
generation<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.980> i<00:03:08.849> think<00:03:09.150> before<00:03:09.599> nobody<00:03:10.170> 50

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470

generation and i think before nobody 50
narration<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.269> kind<00:03:12.450> of

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
narration one here and so that kind of

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.449 
narration one here and so that kind of
clears<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:12.959> not<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.829> fourth<00:03:14.010> question<00:03:14.160> guys

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
clears up not the fourth question guys

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.910 
clears up not the fourth question guys
is<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.879> cpu<00:03:15.390> sucks<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> most<00:03:16.349> power<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.829> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
is the cpu sucks up the most power in a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.640 
is the cpu sucks up the most power in a
pc<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.120> since<00:03:18.359> this<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.780> no<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
pc and then since this is no it's the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.949 
pc and then since this is no it's the
GPU<00:03:19.980> by<00:03:20.130> far<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.609> be<00:03:20.700> honest<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> look<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
GPU by far to be honest and look at the

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.900 
GPU by far to be honest and look at the
amount<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.169> cause<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.620> has<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.829> GPU<00:03:23.370> has<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.669> lot

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
amount of cause it has the GPU has a lot

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030 
amount of cause it has the GPU has a lot
of<00:03:23.940> cars<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.690> needs<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> lot<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.169> power<00:03:25.440> when

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
of cars so it needs a lot of power when

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
of cars so it needs a lot of power when
you<00:03:26.099> look<00:03:26.250> at<00:03:26.340> cpu<00:03:26.730> ceases<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.419> have<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.599> quad

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
you look at cpu ceases to have a quad

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.680 
you look at cpu ceases to have a quad
and<00:03:28.910> they're<00:03:29.910> ever<00:03:30.079> yeah<00:03:31.760> double<00:03:32.760> double

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.339 
and they're ever yeah double double
jewel<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.769> have<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.040> dual<00:03:35.819> quad<00:03:36.359> or<00:03:36.599> six<00:03:37.049> core

my<00:03:42.989> GPU<00:03:43.410> i<00:03:43.609> really<00:03:44.609> can't<00:03:44.819> i<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.180> man<00:03:45.299> has<00:03:45.510> is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
my GPU i really can't i think man has is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.050 
my GPU i really can't i think man has is
it<00:03:46.500> two<00:03:46.739> thousand<00:03:47.160> cause<00:03:47.370> i<00:03:47.669> might<00:03:47.910> be<00:03:48.030> wrong

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
it two thousand cause i might be wrong

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.839 
it two thousand cause i might be wrong
and<00:03:48.480> i<00:03:48.540> might<00:03:48.660> read<00:03:48.810> way<00:03:49.079> off<00:03:49.230> yeah<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.819> know

from them so where ya so the last
question<00:04:20.789> guys<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.810> need<00:04:21.959> high<00:04:22.260> speed<00:04:22.680> ram

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
question guys is you need high speed ram

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.520 
question guys is you need high speed ram

gigs<00:04:48.870> more<00:04:49.380> gigs<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.920> know<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.070> probably

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
gigs more gigs you know you probably

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.890 
gigs more gigs you know you probably
screw<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.850> with<00:04:50.940> four<00:04:51.090> gigs<00:04:51.270> around<00:04:51.390> but

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
screw up in it with four gigs around but

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.450 
screw up in it with four gigs around but
if<00:04:51.960> you've<00:04:52.050> got<00:04:52.230> a<00:04:52.320> dilemma<00:04:52.680> your<00:04:52.920> PC<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.430> will

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
if you've got a dilemma your PC you will

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.370 
if you've got a dilemma your PC you will
not<00:04:53.640> have<00:04:53.760> an<00:04:53.880> issue<00:04:54.000> at<00:04:54.300> all<00:04:54.360> we're<00:04:55.110> playing

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
not have an issue at all we're playing

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.470 
not have an issue at all we're playing
all<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.710> your<00:04:55.920> games<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.430> ultra<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.000> because

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
all of your games in ultra and because

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.880 
all of your games in ultra and because
it's<00:04:57.600> mainly<00:04:57.750> got<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.050> do<00:04:58.140> with<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.410> video<00:04:58.650> RAM

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
it's mainly got to do with the video RAM

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.770 
it's mainly got to do with the video RAM
not<00:04:59.070> start<00:04:59.400> on<00:04:59.580> your<00:04:59.670> graphic<00:05:00.030> card<00:05:00.240> right

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
not start on your graphic card right

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.920 
not start on your graphic card right
next<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.080> GPU<00:05:01.410> chip<00:05:01.850> yeah<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.600> actual

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
next to the GPU chip yeah the actual

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.730 
next to the GPU chip yeah the actual
ramp<00:05:04.200> on<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.470> GPU<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.780> gddr5<00:05:06.780> memory<00:05:06.930> really

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
ramp on the GPU is a gddr5 memory really

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.130 
ramp on the GPU is a gddr5 memory really
fast<00:05:07.920> memory<00:05:08.100> it's<00:05:08.460> usually<00:05:08.850> about<00:05:09.140> 2,000

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
fast memory it's usually about 2,000

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.410 
fast memory it's usually about 2,000
megahertz<00:05:10.650> which<00:05:10.890> as<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:11.970> know<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.090> miles

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
megahertz which as you know is miles

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.570 
megahertz which as you know is miles
faster<00:05:12.660> than<00:05:13.020> system<00:05:13.470> memory<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.160> that's<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
faster than system memory and that's the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.430 
faster than system memory and that's the
actual<00:05:14.700> ram<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.120> uses<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.600> store<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.930> textures

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
actual ram it uses to store the textures

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.410 
actual ram it uses to store the textures
so<00:05:16.950> your<00:05:17.070> GPU<00:05:17.340> can<00:05:17.550> work<00:05:17.700> really<00:05:17.910> fast<00:05:18.030> and

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
so your GPU can work really fast and

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.320 
so your GPU can work really fast and
deliver<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.960> over<00:05:19.650> 60<00:05:19.920> FPS<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.640> games<00:05:21.000> such<00:05:21.270> as

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
deliver you over 60 FPS in games such as

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.630 
deliver you over 60 FPS in games such as
battlefield<00:05:21.660> on<00:05:21.990> altar<00:05:22.290> yeah<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.250> guys<00:05:23.460> that's
