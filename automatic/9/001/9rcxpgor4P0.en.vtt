00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
feel the magnetic field how close does

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.949 
feel the magnetic field how close does
this<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.829> be<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.629> that's<00:02:36.629> what<00:02:36.780> I'm

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this have to be to this that's what I'm

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.720 
this have to be to this that's what I'm
wondering<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.590> don't<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.099> I've<00:02:38.340> never<00:02:38.549> heard

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
wondering I don't know I've never heard

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:48.610 
wondering I don't know I've never heard
growing<00:02:38.909> up<00:02:39.030> before<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> be

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.869 

yeah<00:02:49.709> chore<00:02:50.370> trying<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> figure<00:02:50.909> this<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:52.879> so

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
yeah chore trying to figure this out so

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.580 
yeah chore trying to figure this out so
I<00:02:53.909> think<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.569> back<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.019> drawing<00:02:55.170> board

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
I think it's back to the drawing board

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.069 
I think it's back to the drawing board
for<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.970> not<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.569> work<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.930> my

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
for me this is not going to work on my

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:58.610 
for me this is not going to work on my
bike

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
bike

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.979 
bike
although<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.099> speedo<00:02:59.400> does<00:02:59.730> work<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.319> put<00:03:01.319> a

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
although the speedo does work I put a

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:13.660 
although the speedo does work I put a
bolt<00:03:03.989> through<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:11.180> bolt<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.690> side<00:03:13.019> a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
bolt through a bolt on this side a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.059 
bolt through a bolt on this side a
bracket<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.090> side<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.470> one<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:16.799> that

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
bracket down that side and one on that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.949 
bracket down that side and one on that
side<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.819> that's<00:03:18.000> how<00:03:18.120> close<00:03:18.359> it<00:03:18.540> has<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.840> be

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
side and that's how close it has to be

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.650 
side and that's how close it has to be
to<00:03:19.109> work<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.159> I<00:03:20.190> spin<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.609> around<00:03:23.660> it

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to work so when I spin it around it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.300 
to work so when I spin it around it
passes<00:03:25.230> right<00:03:25.730> by<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
passes right by it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.890 
passes right by it
and<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.879> can<00:03:30.000> see<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.419> works<00:03:30.690> right

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and you can see if this works right

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.189 
and you can see if this works right
there

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
there

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:37.869 
there
when<00:03:32.069> we<00:03:32.190> spin<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> wheel<00:03:36.410> see<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.530> does

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
when we spin the wheel see it does

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.020 
when we spin the wheel see it does
speedometer<00:03:38.879> does<00:03:39.090> work

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.000 

how<00:03:44.030> accurate<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.690> going<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.080> be<00:03:45.230> i'm<00:03:45.800> not

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
how accurate it's going to be i'm not

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.080 
how accurate it's going to be i'm not
sure<00:03:46.310> because<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.130> in<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
sure because this is in this this is a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.640 
sure because this is in this this is a
