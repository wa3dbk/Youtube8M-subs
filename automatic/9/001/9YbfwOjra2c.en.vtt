on how to flood helicopters in bad

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.620 
on how to flood helicopters in bad
coffee<00:00:09.950> too

coffee too

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.730 
coffee too
I'm<00:00:11.630> going<00:00:11.900> to<00:00:11.990> assume<00:00:12.290> that<00:00:12.350> you<00:00:12.590> know<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
I'm going to assume that you know the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.370 
I'm going to assume that you know the
basics<00:00:13.340> of<00:00:13.460> flying<00:00:13.760> helicopters<00:00:14.540> so<00:00:15.019> you<00:00:15.080> know

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
basics of flying helicopters so you know

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.689 
basics of flying helicopters so you know
how<00:00:15.560> to<00:00:15.620> go<00:00:15.830> up<00:00:16.070> down<00:00:16.400> left<00:00:16.850> right<00:00:17.330> shoot<00:00:17.960> and

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
how to go up down left right shoot and

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.249 
how to go up down left right shoot and
whatever<00:00:19.699> but<00:00:20.269> if<00:00:20.509> you<00:00:20.749> want<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:21.050> basic

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
whatever but if you want a basic

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.829 
whatever but if you want a basic
tutorial<00:00:21.589> then<00:00:22.220> give<00:00:22.579> me<00:00:22.699> a<00:00:22.730> message<00:00:22.939> or<00:00:23.300> drop

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
tutorial then give me a message or drop

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.339 
tutorial then give me a message or drop
a<00:00:23.869> comment<00:00:24.140> below<00:00:25.390> so<00:00:26.390> my<00:00:26.749> number<00:00:26.989> one<00:00:27.169> rule

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
a comment below so my number one rule

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.069 
a comment below so my number one rule
for<00:00:27.409> flying<00:00:27.890> helicopters<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:29.050> have<00:00:30.050> a

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
for flying helicopters is have a

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.999 
for flying helicopters is have a
co-pilot

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
co-pilot

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.770 
co-pilot
without<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.699> co-pilot<00:00:31.909> you<00:00:32.450> won't<00:00:32.660> be

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
without a co-pilot you won't be

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.920 
without a co-pilot you won't be
effective<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.410> field<00:00:33.620> at<00:00:33.770> all

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
effective in the field at all

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.660 
effective in the field at all
the<00:00:35.930> copilot<00:00:36.500> would<00:00:36.650> get<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.130> majority<00:00:37.640> of

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the copilot would get the majority of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.350 
the copilot would get the majority of
your<00:00:37.880> points<00:00:38.300> as<00:00:39.040> he<00:00:40.040> simply<00:00:40.760> has<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:40.970> better

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
your points as he simply has the better

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.950 
your points as he simply has the better
gun<00:00:41.630> under<00:00:42.310> helicopters<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.660> he<00:00:44.660> would<00:00:44.810> get

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
gun under helicopters and he would get

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.900 
gun under helicopters and he would get
like<00:00:45.170> 90<00:00:45.620> percent<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:45.980> your<00:00:46.100> points<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.700> you

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
like 90 percent of your points and you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.990 
like 90 percent of your points and you
will<00:00:47.060> get<00:00:47.270> your<00:00:47.780> points<00:00:48.230> four<00:00:48.410> assists<00:00:49.000> so

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
will get your points four assists so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.160 
will get your points four assists so
like<00:00:50.690> for<00:00:51.650> example<00:00:51.730> my<00:00:52.730> regular<00:00:53.180> copilot<00:00:54.080> is

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
like for example my regular copilot is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.340 
like for example my regular copilot is
Panda<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:54.920> he<00:00:55.400> would<00:00:55.640> be<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.600> co-pilot<00:00:56.780> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
Panda and he would be the co-pilot and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.819 
Panda and he would be the co-pilot and
on<00:00:57.650> average<00:00:57.770> he<00:00:58.250> would<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:58.900> 30<00:00:59.900> kills<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.680> a

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
on average he would get 30 kills in a

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.929 
on average he would get 30 kills in a
game<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.310> I<00:01:01.520> would<00:01:01.700> probably<00:01:01.910> get<00:01:02.300> about<00:01:02.600> five

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
game and I would probably get about five

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.570 
game and I would probably get about five
so<00:01:04.939> it's<00:01:05.119> vital<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:05.509> have<00:01:05.659> one<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.400> even<00:01:07.400> if

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it's vital to have one but even if

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 
so it's vital to have one but even if
you<00:01:07.730> do<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> copilot<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.680> need

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
you do have a copilot you and you need

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.730 
you do have a copilot you and you need
to<00:01:09.950> be<00:01:10.070> communicating<00:01:10.850> with<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.360> make<00:01:11.570> sure

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
to be communicating with so make sure

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.230 
to be communicating with so make sure
you<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:12.800> open<00:01:13.220> communications<00:01:14.000> with<00:01:14.210> your

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
you have open communications with your

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.390 
you have open communications with your
copilot<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.320> can<00:01:15.590> be<00:01:15.740> calling<00:01:16.250> out

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
copilot so you can be calling out

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.710 
copilot so you can be calling out
targets<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:18.820> telling<00:01:19.820> him<00:01:19.970> what<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.330> do<00:01:20.479> next

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
targets and telling him what to do next

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.399 
targets and telling him what to do next
and<00:01:21.080> whatever<00:01:22.180> but<00:01:23.180> you'll<00:01:23.930> basically<00:01:24.140> be

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
and whatever but you'll basically be

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.140 
and whatever but you'll basically be
telling<00:01:25.040> or<00:01:25.390> assisting<00:01:26.390> him<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:26.900> how<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:28.280> what

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
telling or assisting him on how on what

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.250 
telling or assisting him on how on what
he's<00:01:29.360> going<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.630> do<00:01:29.810> next

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
he's going to do next

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.410 
he's going to do next
so<00:01:30.740> yeah<00:01:32.620> my<00:01:33.620> next<00:01:33.920> rule<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.000> got<00:01:35.180> to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
so yeah my next rule is you got to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
so yeah my next rule is you got to
prioritize<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.470> targets<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.549> should<00:01:37.820> really

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
prioritize the targets you should really

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.260 
prioritize the targets you should really
prioritize<00:01:38.870> your<00:01:39.049> targets<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.799> how<00:01:40.040> much<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.030> a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
prioritize your targets to how much of a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.440 
prioritize your targets to how much of a
threat<00:01:41.479> they<00:01:41.750> are<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.170> do<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:42.850> on<00:01:43.850> top<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.299> my

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
threat they are to do so on top of my

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.410 
threat they are to do so on top of my
list<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.930> oven<00:01:45.560> helicopters<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.640> going<00:01:47.180> down

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
list is oven helicopters and going down

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.850 
list is oven helicopters and going down
is<00:01:47.890> anti-air<00:01:48.890> guns<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.729> PCS<00:01:50.600> tank<00:01:51.110> stand<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
is anti-air guns a PCS tank stand to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.370 
is anti-air guns a PCS tank stand to
infantry<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.740> whatever<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.540> once<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.080> see

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
infantry and whatever but so once I see

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.950 
infantry and whatever but so once I see
another<00:01:58.010> chopper<00:01:58.340> near<00:01:58.670> an<00:01:59.180> enemy<00:01:59.390> one<00:01:59.780> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
another chopper near an enemy one I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.500 
another chopper near an enemy one I
would<00:02:00.170> immediately<00:02:01.100> switch<00:02:01.580> my<00:02:01.760> attention<00:02:02.240> to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
would immediately switch my attention to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.050 
would immediately switch my attention to
that<00:02:02.960> chopper<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.640> how<00:02:04.640> am<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.820> going<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that chopper and how am I going to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.810 
that chopper and how am I going to
switch<00:02:05.780> his<00:02:05.960> attention<00:02:06.500> as<00:02:06.619> well<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.189> both<00:02:07.610> had

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
switch his attention as well so both had

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.510 
switch his attention as well so both had
the<00:02:07.909> same<00:02:07.939> priorities<00:02:09.099> make<00:02:10.099> sure<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.310> both

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
the same priorities make sure you both

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.400 
the same priorities make sure you both
know<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.060> immediately<00:02:11.660> try<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.990> take<00:02:12.200> out<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
know and immediately try to take out the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.120 
know and immediately try to take out the
highest<00:02:13.040> threat

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
highest threat

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.060 
my enemies so this gives me and my
gunner<00:03:00.170> an<00:03:01.170> advantage<00:03:01.920> over<00:03:02.270> him<00:03:03.270> because

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
gunner an advantage over him because

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.530 
gunner an advantage over him because
they're<00:03:05.070> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> can't<00:03:05.640> aim<00:03:05.850> as<00:03:06.060> high<00:03:06.090> as

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
they're going to can't aim as high as

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.290 
they're going to can't aim as high as
you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.780> aim<00:03:07.230> below<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.760> choppers<00:03:09.180> are

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you can aim below as the choppers are

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.330 
you can aim below as the choppers are
designed<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.320> find<00:03:13.320> him<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.830> charge

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
designed but so here I find him I charge

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.910 
designed but so here I find him I charge
pickup<00:03:14.640> attitude<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.330> got<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.080> altitude<00:03:16.500> over

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
pickup attitude I got the altitude over

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.030 
pickup attitude I got the altitude over
him<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:18.180> gives<00:03:18.450> us<00:03:18.570> an<00:03:18.720> edge<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.500> he

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
him so this gives us an edge but he

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
him so this gives us an edge but he
picks<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.580> well

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
picks up as well

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
picks up as well
but<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:21.840> must<00:03:22.020> take<00:03:22.230> him<00:03:22.380> out<00:03:22.530> before<00:03:22.650> he

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
but we must take him out before he

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
but we must take him out before he
becomes<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.640> bigger<00:03:23.850> threat<00:03:26.810> we<00:03:27.810> should<00:03:28.020> do<00:03:28.230> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
becomes a bigger threat we should do is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.040 
becomes a bigger threat we should do is
learn<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> land<00:03:29.340> landing<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.300> absolutely

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
learn to land landing is absolutely

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.420 
learn to land landing is absolutely
vital<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.530> being<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.980> good<00:03:32.160> pilot<00:03:32.430> because<00:03:33.230> land

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
vital to being a good pilot because land

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.860 
vital to being a good pilot because land
landing<00:03:35.430> would<00:03:35.640> allow<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.510> repair

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
landing would allow you to repair

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.110 
landing would allow you to repair
yourself<00:03:36.960> and<00:03:37.640> get<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.970> situations

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
yourself and get you out of situations

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.750 
yourself and get you out of situations
and<00:03:40.820> yeah<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.720> make<00:03:43.170> sure<00:03:43.200> your<00:03:43.620> copilot<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.580> an

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
and yeah so make sure your copilot is an

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.360 
and yeah so make sure your copilot is an
engineer<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.600> you'll<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.650> still<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.100> sea

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
engineer so you'll be still in the sea

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.340 
engineer so you'll be still in the sea
and<00:03:47.610> he<00:03:47.880> will<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.180> jump<00:03:48.360> out<00:03:48.570> repair<00:03:49.080> like

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
and he will just jump out repair like

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.190 
and he will just jump out repair like
what<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:49.890> see<00:03:50.040> now<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:51.770> yeah<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.600> here's<00:03:55.140> a

and<00:04:32.850> as<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.510> can<00:04:33.600> see<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.810> slow<00:04:34.020> motion

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
and as you can see in slow motion

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.910 
and as you can see in slow motion
that<00:04:34.890> was<00:04:35.040> pretty<00:04:35.400> close<00:04:36.290> we<00:04:37.290> want<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.710> out

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
that was pretty close we want to get out

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.790 
that was pretty close we want to get out
and<00:04:38.420> don't<00:04:39.420> ever<00:04:39.660> believe<00:04:39.900> your<00:04:40.230> teammates

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
and don't ever believe your teammates

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.470 
and don't ever believe your teammates
about<00:04:40.980> landing<00:04:41.640> in<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.970> middle<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.360> the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
about landing in the middle of the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.650 
about landing in the middle of the
battlefield<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.730> also<00:04:44.730> if<00:04:44.970> your<00:04:45.180> learn<00:04:45.450> to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
battlefield and also if your learn to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.650 
battlefield and also if your learn to
learn<00:04:45.860> avoid<00:04:46.860> bumpy<00:04:47.550> land<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.150> what<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.360> mean<00:04:48.600> is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
learn avoid bumpy land so what I mean is

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.680 
learn avoid bumpy land so what I mean is
land<00:04:49.260> on<00:04:49.440> flat<00:04:49.830> land<00:04:49.860> because<00:04:50.670> bumpy<00:04:51.150> land<00:04:51.360> can

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
land on flat land because bumpy land can

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.910 
land on flat land because bumpy land can
seriously<00:04:52.260> mess<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:53.120> even<00:04:54.120> for<00:04:54.270> me<00:04:54.450> so

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
seriously mess you up even for me so

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.000 
seriously mess you up even for me so
like<00:04:55.920> in<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.190> clip<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:57.020> land<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:58.170> bumpy<00:04:58.590> land<00:04:58.800> I

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
like in this clip I land on bumpy land I

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.910 
like in this clip I land on bumpy land I
wasn't<00:04:59.310> really<00:04:59.460> taking<00:04:59.880> notice<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.800> as<00:05:01.800> you

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
wasn't really taking notice and as you

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.820 
wasn't really taking notice and as you
can<00:05:02.010> see<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.490> was<00:05:02.640> making<00:05:03.480> my<00:05:03.720> chopper<00:05:04.470> tilt

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
can see it was making my chopper tilt

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.910 
can see it was making my chopper tilt
over<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.580> luckily<00:05:06.240> once<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.110> stabilize<00:05:07.650> it

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
over and luckily once you stabilize it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.940 
over and luckily once you stabilize it
so<00:05:08.450> make<00:05:09.450> sure<00:05:09.480> he<00:05:09.660> avoided<00:05:10.110> bumpy<00:05:10.470> landin

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
so make sure he avoided bumpy landin

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.330 
so make sure he avoided bumpy landin
London<00:05:11.520> flat<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.530> here's<00:05:13.530> what<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:13.890> happen

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
London flat and here's what would happen

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.810 
London flat and here's what would happen
if<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.580> lump<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.120> hard<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:17.400> would<00:05:17.520> crash

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
if you lump to hard you would crash

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.960 
if you lump to hard you would crash
simple<00:05:18.750> as<00:05:18.810> that

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.360 

so<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.000> read<00:05:24.210> on<00:05:24.360> forms<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:24.930> people<00:05:25.320> say<00:05:25.710> UAV

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
so I read on forms that people say UAV

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.060 
so I read on forms that people say UAV
is<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.820> best<00:05:27.270> solution<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:28.260> take<00:05:28.830> another

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
is the best solution to take another

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.550 
is the best solution to take another
helicopter<00:05:29.400> if<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.900> partners<00:05:31.260> with<00:05:31.380> it

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
helicopter if you have partners with it

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
helicopter if you have partners with it
but<00:05:32.900> yeah<00:05:33.900> they<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.230> do<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.740> lot<00:05:34.950> of<00:05:34.980> damage<00:05:35.250> it

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
but yeah they do do a lot of damage it

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.210 
but yeah they do do a lot of damage it
can<00:05:35.670> be<00:05:35.850> big<00:05:36.240> nuisance<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:37.080> shooting<00:05:37.920> up<00:05:38.100> the

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
can be big nuisance and shooting up the

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.720 
can be big nuisance and shooting up the
UAV<00:05:38.670> India<00:05:38.970> is<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.450> stupid<00:05:40.080> idea<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.830> here<00:05:41.520> I

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
UAV India is a stupid idea so here I

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.310 
UAV India is a stupid idea so here I
teach<00:05:41.970> my<00:05:42.150> priorities<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:44.460> UAV<00:05:45.060> pilot<00:05:45.990> so

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
teach my priorities to the UAV pilot so

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.030 
teach my priorities to the UAV pilot so
barriers<00:05:47.010> we<00:05:48.000> both<00:05:48.240> target<00:05:48.720> my<00:05:48.960> gonna<00:05:49.410> will

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
barriers we both target my gonna will

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760 
barriers we both target my gonna will
target<00:05:50.340> him<00:05:50.640> we<00:05:50.970> take<00:05:51.150> him<00:05:51.300> out<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:51.530> he's<00:05:52.530> gone

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
target him we take him out and he's gone

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.840 
target him we take him out and he's gone
simple<00:05:53.280> as<00:05:53.370> that

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
simple as that

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.680 
simple as that
and<00:05:54.240> here<00:05:55.400> we<00:05:56.400> change<00:05:56.580> our<00:05:56.760> priorities<00:05:56.970> as

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
and here we change our priorities as

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.860 
and here we change our priorities as
soon<00:05:57.870> as<00:05:57.990> we<00:05:58.140> see<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.440> but<00:05:58.980> she<00:05:59.130> took<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.870> guy

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
soon as we see it but she took the guy

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.600 
soon as we see it but she took the guy
monitoring<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:02.010> he's<00:06:02.250> gone<00:06:02.460> already

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
monitoring it and he's gone already

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.130 
monitoring it and he's gone already
simple<00:06:03.600> as<00:06:03.660> that

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
simple as that

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.110 
simple as that
so<00:06:04.620> shoot<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:05.690> pilot<00:06:07.340> so<00:06:08.340> now<00:06:08.580> I'm<00:06:08.880> going<00:06:09.060> to

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
so shoot a pilot so now I'm going to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.510 
so shoot a pilot so now I'm going to
attempt<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.660> teach<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:10.440> how<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.650> do<00:06:10.980> circle

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
attempt to teach you how to do circle

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.130 
attempt to teach you how to do circle
strafing<00:06:12.890> circle<00:06:13.890> strafing<00:06:14.130> is<00:06:14.840> kind<00:06:15.840> of<00:06:15.960> a

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
strafing circle strafing is kind of a

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.500 
strafing circle strafing is kind of a
traditional<00:06:17.010> battlefield<00:06:17.700> technique<00:06:18.210> in

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
traditional battlefield technique in

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.110 
traditional battlefield technique in
helicopters<00:06:19.410> it's<00:06:20.100> where<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:21.740> keep<00:06:22.740> your

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
helicopters it's where you keep your

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.780 
helicopters it's where you keep your
crosshair<00:06:24.120> on<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.680> target<00:06:25.680> that<00:06:25.980> your<00:06:26.220> plan

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
crosshair on the target that your plan

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.060 
crosshair on the target that your plan
to<00:06:26.970> take<00:06:27.180> out<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:27.660> circle<00:06:28.290> around<00:06:28.380> him<00:06:28.800> so

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
to take out and circle around him so

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.900 
to take out and circle around him so
you're<00:06:29.280> kind<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.790> orbiting<00:06:30.510> around<00:06:30.630> him

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
you're kind of orbiting around him

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.330 
you're kind of orbiting around him
you<00:06:33.450> get<00:06:33.630> kind<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:33.930> used<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.230> it<00:06:34.500> you<00:06:34.740> get<00:06:35.280> a

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
you get kind of used to it you get a

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.670 
you get kind of used to it you get a
feel<00:06:35.640> for<00:06:35.730> it<00:06:36.000> no<00:06:36.150> Finn<00:06:36.450> and<00:06:36.660> you<00:06:36.690> just<00:06:37.050> you

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
feel for it no Finn and you just you

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.700 
feel for it no Finn and you just you
just<00:06:37.710> know<00:06:38.130> once<00:06:38.610> you<00:06:38.730> get<00:06:38.850> into<00:06:39.000> it<00:06:39.270> so<00:06:39.750> to

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
just know once you get into it so to

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.730 
just know once you get into it so to
circa<00:06:40.980> strafe<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.850> pick<00:06:42.660> assign<00:06:42.930> to<00:06:43.050> strafe<00:06:43.380> I

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
circa strafe you pick assign to strafe I

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.240 
circa strafe you pick assign to strafe I
preferred<00:06:44.340> strafing<00:06:44.790> right<00:06:45.150> and<00:06:45.890> use<00:06:46.890> a<00:06:46.920> right

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
preferred strafing right and use a right

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.120 
preferred strafing right and use a right
analog<00:06:47.550> stick<00:06:47.700> to<00:06:48.210> adjust<00:06:48.690> to<00:06:48.900> your<00:06:49.320> target<00:06:49.830> so

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
analog stick to adjust to your target so

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.900 
analog stick to adjust to your target so
it's<00:06:51.680> kind<00:06:52.680> of<00:06:52.740> hard<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:53.040> explain<00:06:53.100> how<00:06:53.640> to<00:06:53.700> do

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
it's kind of hard to explain how to do

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.870 
it's kind of hard to explain how to do
it<00:06:54.030> but<00:06:54.300> once<00:06:54.870> you<00:06:55.080> get<00:06:55.320> into<00:06:55.470> it<00:06:55.770> is<00:06:55.890> for

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
it but once you get into it is for

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.670 
it but once you get into it is for
experience<00:06:57.450> no<00:06:57.630> feel<00:06:57.900> it's<00:06:58.050> generally<00:06:58.440> quite

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
experience no feel it's generally quite

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.400 
experience no feel it's generally quite
easy<00:06:58.920> to<00:06:59.040> do<00:06:59.310> want<00:07:00.300> to<00:07:00.360> get<00:07:00.510> into<00:07:00.660> it<00:07:00.930> so<00:07:01.760> yeah<00:07:02.760> I

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
easy to do want to get into it so yeah I

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.900 
easy to do want to get into it so yeah I
don't<00:07:04.410> really<00:07:04.770> tend<00:07:04.980> to<00:07:05.160> circle<00:07:05.700> straight

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
don't really tend to circle straight

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.760 
don't really tend to circle straight
from<00:07:06.060> this<00:07:06.150> game<00:07:06.360> much<00:07:06.600> because<00:07:06.930> it<00:07:07.200> doesn't

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
from this game much because it doesn't

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.820 
from this game much because it doesn't
really<00:07:08.750> benefit<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.900> team<00:07:09.930> it's<00:07:10.470> just<00:07:10.530> it

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
really benefit the team it's just it

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.760 
really benefit the team it's just it
shows<00:07:11.070> off<00:07:11.250> your<00:07:11.280> skill<00:07:11.760> but<00:07:12.320> it's<00:07:13.320> not<00:07:13.470> really

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
shows off your skill but it's not really

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.430 
shows off your skill but it's not really
practical<00:07:14.250> unless<00:07:14.700> it's<00:07:15.390> necessary<00:07:15.690> because

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
practical unless it's necessary because

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.830 
practical unless it's necessary because
the<00:07:17.280> enemy's<00:07:17.790> got<00:07:17.970> all<00:07:18.120> your<00:07:18.240> flags<00:07:18.540> and

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
the enemy's got all your flags and

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.690 
the enemy's got all your flags and
everyone<00:07:19.290> your<00:07:19.470> spawn<00:07:19.740> is<00:07:20.010> that's<00:07:20.490> where

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
everyone your spawn is that's where

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.280 
everyone your spawn is that's where
that's<00:07:20.760> circa<00:07:21.120> straight<00:07:21.480> but<00:07:21.780> if<00:07:21.960> we're

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
that's circa straight but if we're

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.620 
that's circa straight but if we're
dominating<00:07:22.950> there's<00:07:23.640> absolutely<00:07:24.150> no<00:07:24.360> need

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
dominating there's absolutely no need

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.620 
dominating there's absolutely no need
because<00:07:24.870> you'll<00:07:25.140> be<00:07:25.260> a<00:07:25.290> target<00:07:25.710> on<00:07:26.460> the<00:07:26.670> from

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
because you'll be a target on the from

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.010 
because you'll be a target on the from
the<00:07:27.810> enemy<00:07:28.170> so<00:07:28.950> here<00:07:29.220> I'm<00:07:29.460> circle<00:07:30.210> strafing<00:07:30.450> to

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
the enemy so here I'm circle strafing to

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.700 
the enemy so here I'm circle strafing to
see<00:07:31.260> house<00:07:31.530> or<00:07:31.920> see<00:07:32.280> area<00:07:32.790> and<00:07:33.470> see<00:07:34.470> how<00:07:34.650> she

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
see house or see area and see how she

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.360 
see house or see area and see how she
pretty<00:07:35.010> much<00:07:35.160> has<00:07:35.400> never<00:07:35.850> left<00:07:36.150> my<00:07:36.390> target<00:07:37.380> on

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370 
pretty much has never left my target on

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.710 
pretty much has never left my target on
my<00:07:38.700> screen<00:07:39.150> and<00:07:40.040> two<00:07:41.040> tanks<00:07:41.430> munch<00:07:41.640> to<00:07:42.000> go<00:07:42.510> back

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 
my screen and two tanks munch to go back

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.740 
my screen and two tanks munch to go back
in<00:07:42.960> we<00:07:43.350> cleared<00:07:43.650> out<00:07:43.770> the<00:07:43.920> area<00:07:44.250> and<00:07:44.750> job<00:07:45.750> done
