00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:38.979 
two very experienced guys lee lee is

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.770 
two very experienced guys lee lee is
he's<00:00:39.879> one<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.179> good<00:00:40.300> guys<00:00:40.359> of<00:00:40.719> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
he's one of the good guys of the

championship beardo he's he's an
absolute<00:00:43.839> pro<00:00:44.319> so<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.649> think<00:00:44.789> realistically

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
absolute pro so I think realistically

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.360 
absolute pro so I think realistically
those<00:00:46.239> those<00:00:46.539> guys<00:00:46.809> you<00:00:47.649> know<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
those those guys you know that the the

those those guys you know that the the
Erebus<00:00:48.760> Mercedes<00:00:49.420> combo<00:00:49.780> at<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.960> moment

Erebus Mercedes combo at the moment

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.989 
Erebus Mercedes combo at the moment
probably<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.649> bit<00:00:50.769> of<00:00:50.829> an<00:00:50.920> unknown<00:00:51.039> but<00:00:51.609> I<00:00:51.670> think

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
probably a bit of an unknown but I think

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.809 
probably a bit of an unknown but I think
in<00:00:52.569> terms<00:00:52.929> of<00:00:53.109> driver<00:00:53.379> pairings<00:00:53.920> very<00:00:54.579> very

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:54.819 
in terms of driver pairings very very

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.959 
in terms of driver pairings very very
strong<00:00:55.120> then<00:00:55.929> we<00:00:56.019> go<00:00:56.139> to<00:00:56.170> car<00:00:56.739> 9<00:00:57.039> maro<00:00:57.489> engel

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
demon he really he really is a hard

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.010 
demon he really he really is a hard
worker<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:51.490> Tommy<00:01:52.359> oh<00:01:52.450> he<00:01:52.539> just<00:01:52.570> comes<00:01:52.899> in

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
worker and Tommy oh he just comes in

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.660 
worker and Tommy oh he just comes in
every<00:01:53.140> year<00:01:53.439> steps<00:01:53.770> into<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.159> co-driving

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
every year steps into that co-driving

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.010 
every year steps into that co-driving
role<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.060> does<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.210> really<00:01:55.600> really<00:01:55.749> good<00:01:55.960> job

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
role and does a really really good job

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.440 
role and does a really really good job
so<00:01:56.409> I<00:01:56.439> think<00:01:56.710> for<00:01:57.520> me<00:01:57.549> they're<00:01:57.850> probably<00:01:58.090> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
so I think for me they're probably the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.999 
so I think for me they're probably the
they're<00:01:58.719> probably<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.079> combo<00:01:59.409> at<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.679> moment

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
they're probably the combo at the moment

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.800 
they're probably the combo at the moment
out<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.549> three<00:02:00.759> cars<00:02:00.999> and<00:02:01.329> I'll<00:02:01.749> be

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
out of the three cars and I'll be

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.480 
out of the three cars and I'll be
interesting<00:02:02.109> to<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.319> how<00:02:02.350> how<00:02:02.829> they<00:02:02.979> go<00:02:03.130> as<00:02:03.429> a

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
interesting to see how how they go as a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.160 
interesting to see how how they go as a
fan<00:02:04.179> what<00:02:04.479> do<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.600> think<00:02:04.749> it's<00:02:04.869> going<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.049> be

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
fan what do you think it's going to be

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.330 
fan what do you think it's going to be

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
performance package but fortunately the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.490 
performance package but fortunately the
guys<00:03:08.970> have<00:03:09.210> adapted<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:09.960> quickly<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
guys have adapted really quickly to that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800 
guys have adapted really quickly to that
and<00:03:10.680> we've<00:03:10.800> seen<00:03:11.040> some<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.390> results

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
and we've seen some of the the results

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.010 
and we've seen some of the the results
over<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.110> last<00:03:13.260> few<00:03:13.410> races<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:14.250> since

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
over the last few races really since

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
over the last few races really since
since<00:03:16.020> Darwin<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.980> Townsville<00:03:17.820> and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
since Darwin and then in Townsville and

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.610 
since Darwin and then in Townsville and
then<00:03:18.120> Queensland<00:03:18.600> Raceway<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.960> i<00:03:19.170> guess<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
then Queensland Raceway so i guess the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.810 
then Queensland Raceway so i guess the
between<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> northern<00:03:20.220> territory<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
between the northern territory and the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.860 
between the northern territory and the
Queen's<00:03:21.030> there<00:03:21.180> around<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.510> been<00:03:21.660> quite

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
Queen's there around it's been quite

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.180 
Queen's there around it's been quite
kind<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.260> us<00:03:22.380> we're<00:03:22.560> hoping<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.830> bring<00:03:22.980> some

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
kind to us we're hoping to bring some

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.680 
kind to us we're hoping to bring some
performance<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.000> certainly<00:03:24.210> take<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
performance here and certainly take that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.290 
performance here and certainly take that
into<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.050> endurance<00:03:25.380> season<00:03:25.710> as<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.970> say<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
into the endurance season as you say the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.940 
into the endurance season as you say the
pace<00:03:27.510> has<00:03:27.720> been<00:03:27.870> increasing<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.710> guess

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
pace has been increasing but I guess

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.590 
pace has been increasing but I guess
these<00:03:29.100> enduros<00:03:29.550> are<00:03:29.760> looming<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.120> bit<00:03:30.300> with

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
these enduros are looming a bit with

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.940 
these enduros are looming a bit with
where<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.020> are<00:03:31.140> with<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> engine<00:03:31.770> package

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
where you are with the engine package

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250 
where you are with the engine package
what<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.330> expect<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.110> can

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
what can we really expect that you can

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.220 
what can we really expect that you can
achieve<00:03:34.350> at<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.920> endurance<00:03:35.700> races<00:03:36.030> yeah<00:03:36.960> good

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
achieve at the endurance races yeah good

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.500 
achieve at the endurance races yeah good
question<00:03:37.380> our<00:03:38.160> expectations<00:03:38.940> absolutely<00:03:39.420> to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
question our expectations absolutely to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.790 
question our expectations absolutely to
be<00:03:39.600> able<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.780> go<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.500> certainly

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
be able to go there and certainly

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.340 
be able to go there and certainly
perform<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.450> results<00:03:42.870> exactly<00:03:43.260> what

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
perform for the results exactly what

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.510 
perform for the results exactly what
we've<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.620> what<00:03:43.890> we've<00:03:44.040> done<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.490> last

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
we've got what we've done over the last

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.490 
we've got what we've done over the last
couple<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.940> races<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.390> well<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:45.840> there's

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
couple of races as well so there's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.770 
couple of races as well so there's
certainly<00:03:46.770> no<00:03:47.360> second-guessing<00:03:48.360> ourselves

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
certainly no second-guessing ourselves

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.020 
certainly no second-guessing ourselves
as<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.350> how<00:03:49.500> our<00:03:49.530> preparations<00:03:50.280> going<00:03:50.490> towards

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
as to how our preparations going towards

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.340 
as to how our preparations going towards
the<00:03:51.150> insurance<00:03:51.510> package<00:03:51.870> we're<00:03:52.080> certainly

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
the insurance package we're certainly

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.380 
the insurance package we're certainly
not<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.740> there<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.550> make<00:03:53.670> up<00:03:53.850> numbers<00:03:54.000> we're

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
not going there to make up numbers we're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.150 
not going there to make up numbers we're
going<00:03:54.630> there<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.959> run<00:03:55.140> at<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.800> front<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
going there to run at the front of the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.760 
going there to run at the front of the
pack<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:57.180> then<00:03:57.450> see<00:03:57.660> what<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:58.020> what<00:03:58.650> we

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
pack and then see what we can what we

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.430 
pack and then see what we can what we
can<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.160> least<00:03:59.910> make<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.330> other<00:04:01.140> teams

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
can do to least make the other teams

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.510 
can do to least make the other teams
that<00:04:01.590> usually<00:04:01.709> run<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.190> front<00:04:02.400> there

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
that usually run at the front there

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.070 
that usually run at the front there
certainly<00:04:02.880> stand<00:04:03.120> up<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.360> take<00:04:03.450> notice<00:04:03.690> we

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
certainly stand up and take notice we

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.660 
certainly stand up and take notice we
hopefully<00:04:04.260> will<00:04:04.770> be<00:04:04.830> there<00:04:05.160> for<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.340> sprint

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
hopefully will be there for that sprint

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.760 
hopefully will be there for that sprint
race<00:04:05.820> at<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> end<00:04:06.240> of<00:04:06.300> them<00:04:06.450> well<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.560> been<00:04:07.740> a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
race at the end of them well it's been a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.350 
race at the end of them well it's been a
particularly<00:04:08.160> tough<00:04:08.340> run<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.910> year<00:04:09.090> for<00:04:09.240> Lee

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360

car the future cars you actually drove

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.640 
car the future cars you actually drove
the<00:04:32.669> prototype<00:04:33.120> there<00:04:33.449> last<00:04:33.690> year<00:04:33.870> not<00:04:34.560> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the prototype there last year not the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.170 
the prototype there last year not the
Mercedes<00:04:35.009> of<00:04:35.160> course<00:04:35.370> but<00:04:35.699> what<00:04:36.000> did<00:04:36.090> you

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
Mercedes of course but what did you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.900 
Mercedes of course but what did you
think<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.509> how<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.900> handled<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.259> trunk<00:04:37.880> yeah<00:04:38.880> i

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
think of how it handled the trunk yeah i

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.689 
think of how it handled the trunk yeah i
mean<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.360> prototype<00:04:40.259> was<00:04:41.009> actually<00:04:41.490> it

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
mean the the prototype was actually it

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.219 
mean the the prototype was actually it
was<00:04:41.789> built<00:04:42.000> built<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.419> well<00:04:42.569> by<00:04:42.900> v8

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
was built built really well by v8

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.879 
was built built really well by v8
supercars<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.550> drive<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> on<00:04:45.360> Balthus

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
supercars and so to drive it on Balthus

supercars and so to drive it on Balthus
track<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.069> was<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:48.509> actually<00:04:48.840> felt<00:04:49.050> really

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
track it was it actually felt really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.110 
track it was it actually felt really
good<00:04:49.440> looking<00:04:50.250> forward<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.580> going<00:04:50.759> back<00:04:50.819> there

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
good looking forward to going back there

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.010 
good looking forward to going back there
in<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:52.050> mercedes-benz<00:04:52.470> AMG<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> and

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
in the the mercedes-benz AMG and and

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.360 
in the the mercedes-benz AMG and and
giving<00:04:55.259> it<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.410> good<00:04:55.560> crack<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.039> obviously

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
giving it a good crack because obviously

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.800 
giving it a good crack because obviously
we've<00:04:56.759> done<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:56.940> lot<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.120> development<00:04:57.720> on<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
we've done a lot of development on the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.520 
we've done a lot of development on the
cars<00:04:58.080> since<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.889> prototype<00:05:00.080> but<00:05:01.080> yet<00:05:01.259> good<00:05:01.410> to

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
cars since the prototype but yet good to

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.839 
cars since the prototype but yet good to
get<00:05:01.650> some<00:05:01.710> miles<00:05:02.039> around<00:05:02.280> there<00:05:02.490> last<00:05:02.699> year

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
get some miles around there last year

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.610 
get some miles around there last year
and<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> thing<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.509> really<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.349> know<00:05:04.440> get

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
and the thing and really you know get

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.050 
and the thing and really you know get
the<00:05:04.710> heads<00:05:04.889> up<00:05:05.070> on<00:05:05.220> how<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.490> handles<00:05:05.849> but

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
the heads up on how it handles but

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.120 
the heads up on how it handles but
really<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.570> not<00:05:06.810> too<00:05:06.960> much<00:05:07.110> different<00:05:07.919> to

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
really it's not too much different to

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.150 
really it's not too much different to
you<00:05:08.639> know<00:05:08.759> last<00:05:09.120> year's<00:05:09.360> Becca<00:05:09.919> last<00:05:10.919> year's

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
you know last year's Becca last year's

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.189 
you know last year's Becca last year's
race<00:05:11.310> was<00:05:11.490> really<00:05:11.669> dominated<00:05:12.389> by<00:05:12.509> tires<00:05:12.810> and

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
race was really dominated by tires and

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.020 
race was really dominated by tires and
we've<00:05:13.320> seen<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.710> be<00:05:13.979> an<00:05:14.099> issue<00:05:14.190> across<00:05:14.669> a<00:05:14.789> few

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
we've seen that be an issue across a few

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.939 
we've seen that be an issue across a few
years<00:05:15.240> up<00:05:15.630> there<00:05:15.690> do<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.620> think<00:05:16.770> it's<00:05:16.860> going

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
years up there do you think it's going

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.310 
years up there do you think it's going
to<00:05:17.039> be<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.159> same<00:05:17.310> again<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.639> year<00:05:17.699> I<00:05:18.320> think

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
to be the same again this year I think

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.320 
to be the same again this year I think
these<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.190> Dunlop<00:05:20.789> tyres<00:05:21.409> are<00:05:22.409> a<00:05:22.440> very

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
these the Dunlop tyres are a very

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.180 
these the Dunlop tyres are a very
durable<00:05:24.330> tire<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:25.020> know<00:05:25.139> they<00:05:25.289> handle<00:05:25.860> all

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
durable tire you know they handle all

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.059 
durable tire you know they handle all
conditions<00:05:26.840> depending<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.590> can

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
conditions depending on you know you can

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.290 
conditions depending on you know you can
stretch<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.490> boundaries<00:05:29.789> with<00:05:30.090> tire

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
stretch the boundaries with tire

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.820 
stretch the boundaries with tire
pressures<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.409> when<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.710> problems

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
pressures and that's when the problems

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.999 
pressures and that's when the problems
occur<00:05:32.310> when<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.639> drop<00:05:32.820> them<00:05:32.940> too<00:05:33.120> low<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:34.740> get

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
occur when you drop them too low you get

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.159 
occur when you drop them too low you get
more<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.340> flex<00:05:35.550> in<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.759> tyre<00:05:36.060> wall<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.599> you

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
more to flex in the tyre wall and you

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.020 
more to flex in the tyre wall and you
drop<00:05:37.440> off<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.770> track<00:05:38.009> with<00:05:38.250> with<00:05:38.880> low

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
drop off the track with with low

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.399 
drop off the track with with low
pressures<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:39.539> can<00:05:39.659> do<00:05:39.780> some<00:05:39.990> damage<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.349> the

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
pressures you can do some damage to the

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.830 
pressures you can do some damage to the
tire<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:40.919> Bathurst<00:05:41.699> is<00:05:41.849> typically<00:05:42.300> being<00:05:42.750> a

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
tire so Bathurst is typically being a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.899 
tire so Bathurst is typically being a
place<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.409> last<00:05:43.560> five<00:05:44.400> years<00:05:44.430> where<00:05:44.880> we've

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
place in the last five years where we've

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.629 
place in the last five years where we've
seen<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.240> lot<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.979> delaminating<00:05:46.979> tires<00:05:47.219> and

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
seen a lot of delaminating tires and

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.249 
seen a lot of delaminating tires and
that<00:05:47.940> sort<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.210> thing<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.539> that's<00:05:48.690> usually

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
that sort of thing and that's usually

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.200 
that sort of thing and that's usually
because<00:05:49.289> of<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:50.340> know<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.460> speeds<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
because of you know the speeds and the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.480 
because of you know the speeds and the
g-forces<00:05:52.169> we<00:05:52.320> got<00:05:52.469> through<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.830> corners<00:05:53.219> plus

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
g-forces we got through the corners plus

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.760 
g-forces we got through the corners plus
hitting<00:05:53.820> curbs<00:05:54.030> at<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.300> same<00:05:54.509> time<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:55.590> Thai

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
hitting curbs at the same time the Thai

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.379 
hitting curbs at the same time the Thai
doesn't<00:05:56.099> like<00:05:56.219> that<00:05:56.430> but<00:05:56.639> you<00:05:57.120> know<00:05:57.210> with<00:05:57.360> a

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
doesn't like that but you know with a

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.830 
doesn't like that but you know with a
smaller<00:05:57.719> side<00:05:58.050> wall<00:05:58.289> I<00:05:59.130> think<00:06:00.090> that<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.659> car

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
smaller side wall I think that the car

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.140 
smaller side wall I think that the car
will<00:06:00.990> handle<00:06:01.259> better<00:06:01.440> there<00:06:01.680> but<00:06:01.860> also<00:06:02.150> we

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
will handle better there but also we

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.850 
will handle better there but also we
just<00:06:03.360> got<00:06:03.509> to<00:06:03.630> keep<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.259> mind<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.710> we

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
just got to keep that in mind that we

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.529 
just got to keep that in mind that we
can't<00:06:05.280> drop<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.639> pressures<00:06:05.969> too<00:06:06.120> much<00:06:06.330> or

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
can't drop the pressures too much or

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.270 
can't drop the pressures too much or
else<00:06:06.630> you're<00:06:06.810> going<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:06.990> do<00:06:07.110> some<00:06:07.320> damage<00:06:07.500> it's

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
else you're going to do some damage it's

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.459 
else you're going to do some damage it's
