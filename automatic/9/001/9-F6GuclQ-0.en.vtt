is the best of all go through and talk

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.070 
is the best of all go through and talk
about<00:02:25.220> each<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.760> first<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.690> battery

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
about each so first we have battery

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.640 
about each so first we have battery
battery<00:02:27.440> has<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> kinetic<00:02:28.370> armor<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
battery has the kinetic armor and the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.080 
battery has the kinetic armor and the
our<00:02:29.709> mashina<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.189> war<00:02:30.310> machine<00:02:30.579> I<00:02:30.700> really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
our mashina the war machine I really

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.080 
our mashina the war machine I really
don't<00:02:31.180> see<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.860> solid<00:02:32.860> specialist<00:02:33.459> it's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
don't see as a solid specialist it's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.160 
don't see as a solid specialist it's
like<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.299> war<00:02:34.420> marching<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:34.840> remember

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
like the war marching that we remember

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
like the war marching that we remember
from<00:02:35.200> black<00:02:35.500> ops<00:02:35.709> 2<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.459> game<00:02:36.610> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
from black ops 2 and in this game it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.449 
from black ops 2 and in this game it
just<00:02:36.790> doesn't<00:02:37.269> seem<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.569> useful<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:39.370> we

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
just doesn't seem that useful then we

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.369 
just doesn't seem that useful then we
also<00:02:39.610> have<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.000> kinetic<00:02:40.420> armor<00:02:40.900> which<00:02:41.140> acts

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
also have the kinetic armor which acts

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.920 
also have the kinetic armor which acts
as<00:02:41.560> sort<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:42.879> mini<00:02:43.390> juggernaut

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
as sort of like a little mini juggernaut

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
as sort of like a little mini juggernaut
I<00:02:43.959> guess<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.290> would<00:02:44.379> say<00:02:44.409> if<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.829> guys

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I guess you would say if you guys

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.259 
I guess you would say if you guys
remember<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.250> perk<00:02:45.579> from<00:02:45.819> college<00:02:46.120> before

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
remember that perk from college before

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.050 
remember that perk from college before
um<00:02:46.750> except<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.859> really<00:02:48.280> not<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.489> strong<00:02:48.909> I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
um except it's really not that strong I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.640 
um except it's really not that strong I
feel<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.420> time<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.840> kill<00:02:50.109> in<00:02:50.319> this<00:02:50.470> game

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
feel like the time to kill in this game

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.410 
feel like the time to kill in this game
is<00:02:50.859> pretty<00:02:51.099> fast<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.879> don't<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.299> see

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
is pretty fast and I don't really see

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.630 
is pretty fast and I don't really see
kinetic<00:02:53.019> armor<00:02:53.379> doing<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.099> whole<00:02:54.310> lot<00:02:54.459> I've

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
kinetic armor doing a whole lot I've

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.699 
kinetic armor doing a whole lot I've
used<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> few<00:02:55.120> times<00:02:55.359> in<00:02:56.019> game<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.439> I<00:02:56.530> just

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
used it a few times in game and I just

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.559 
used it a few times in game and I just
not<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> fan<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.579> it<00:02:57.849> doesn't<00:02:58.180> seem<00:02:58.269> like<00:02:58.450> it

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
not a fan of it it doesn't seem like it

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.929 
not a fan of it it doesn't seem like it
adds<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.019> much<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.439> health<00:02:59.739> boost<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.370> I

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
adds that much of a health boost and I

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.039 
adds that much of a health boost and I
just<00:03:01.150> don't<00:03:01.299> really<00:03:01.420> feel<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.989> worth

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
just don't really feel like it's worth

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.899 
just don't really feel like it's worth
it<00:03:02.560> working<00:03:03.069> up<00:03:03.159> towards<00:03:03.310> your<00:03:03.430> specialist

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
it working up towards your specialist

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.699 
it working up towards your specialist
all<00:03:04.060> game<00:03:04.299> long<00:03:04.329> just<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.900> use<00:03:05.139> this<00:03:05.319> for<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> few

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
all game long just to use this for a few

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.379 
all game long just to use this for a few
seconds<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.519> not<00:03:06.639> even<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.180> big

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
seconds and really not even get that big

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.449 
seconds and really not even get that big
of<00:03:07.510> an<00:03:07.599> advantage<00:03:07.900> out<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.470> next<00:03:09.069> up<00:03:09.190> we

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
of an advantage out of it next up we

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.009 
of an advantage out of it next up we
have<00:03:09.489> profit<00:03:10.060> with<00:03:10.180> which<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.810> said<00:03:10.840> I

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
have profit with which like I said I

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.099 
have profit with which like I said I
think<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.769> best<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.190> got<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> tempest

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
think is the best it's got the tempest

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.690 
think is the best it's got the tempest
electric<00:03:14.109> energy<00:03:14.349> weapon<00:03:14.889> which<00:03:15.370> is

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
electric energy weapon which is

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000 
electric energy weapon which is
absolutely<00:03:16.599> amazing<00:03:17.019> this<00:03:17.349> thing<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.739> think<00:03:17.799> it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
absolutely amazing this thing I think it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.800 
absolutely amazing this thing I think it
has<00:03:18.129> eight<00:03:18.430> shots<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.970> fire<00:03:19.150> pretty<00:03:19.510> quickly

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
has eight shots that fire pretty quickly

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.160 
has eight shots that fire pretty quickly
back<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.290> back<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:21.579> is<00:03:21.939> a<00:03:22.030> very<00:03:22.329> very<00:03:22.689> solid

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
back to back and it is a very very solid

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.990 
back to back and it is a very very solid
specialist<00:03:23.680> weapon<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.310> one<00:03:24.489> hit<00:03:24.700> kill

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
specialist weapon so one hit kill

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.729 
specialist weapon so one hit kill
sometimes<00:03:25.659> you<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.900> even<00:03:25.959> get<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> double<00:03:26.560> kill

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
sometimes you can even get a double kill

with it I've seen that happen a few
times<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:29.349> very<00:03:29.590> very<00:03:29.650> solid<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.400> I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
times and it's very very solid and I

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.920 
times and it's very very solid and I
definitely<00:03:31.000> suggest<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.389> guys<00:03:31.510> try<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.810> out

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
definitely suggest you guys try it out

definitely suggest you guys try it out
if<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.109> haven't<00:03:32.139> already<00:03:32.439> he<00:03:32.950> also<00:03:33.189> has<00:03:33.669> the

if you haven't already he also has the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.640 
if you haven't already he also has the
glitch<00:03:34.599> which<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.109> almost<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
glitch which is almost like a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.740 
glitch which is almost like a
teleportation<00:03:36.340> ability<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.120> allows<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.629> to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
teleportation ability it allows you to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.360 
teleportation ability it allows you to
travel<00:03:37.989> back<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.680> place<00:03:38.919> where<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.160> were

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
travel back to a place where you were

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.150 
travel back to a place where you were
just<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.669> few<00:03:39.849> seconds<00:03:40.209> ago<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.829> can<00:03:42.010> help

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
just a few seconds ago and it can help

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.740 
just a few seconds ago and it can help
you<00:03:42.310> avoid<00:03:42.579> getting<00:03:42.639> killed<00:03:43.180> around<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.510> corner

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
you avoid getting killed around a corner

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.699 
you avoid getting killed around a corner
or<00:03:43.959> something<00:03:44.079> like<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.349> are<00:03:44.530> getting

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
or something like that are getting

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.039 
or something like that are getting
killed<00:03:44.889> from<00:03:45.069> behind<00:03:45.430> which<00:03:46.359> seems<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.870> little

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
killed from behind which seems a little

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.390 
killed from behind which seems a little
bit<00:03:47.230> overpowered<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:47.949> I've<00:03:48.069> seen<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.370> happen

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
bit overpowered but I've seen it happen

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.949 
bit overpowered but I've seen it happen
a<00:03:48.639> few<00:03:48.669> times<00:03:48.849> in<00:03:49.209> game<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.599> it's<00:03:49.810> not

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
a few times in game and it's not

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.689 
a few times in game and it's not
anything<00:03:50.199> too<00:03:50.530> crazy<00:03:50.739> because<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.430> see

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
anything too crazy because you can see

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.399 
anything too crazy because you can see
where<00:03:51.940> they're<00:03:52.060> teleporting<00:03:52.599> back<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:53.019> they

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
where they're teleporting back to they

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.259 
where they're teleporting back to they
leave<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> little<00:03:54.069> trail<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.400> little<00:03:55.090> like

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
leave like a little trail a little like

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.210 
leave like a little trail a little like
wave<00:03:55.569> trail<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> guess<00:03:56.169> you<00:03:56.290> could<00:03:56.440> call<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.650> so

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
wave trail I guess you could call it so

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.280 
wave trail I guess you could call it so
I<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:57.879> really<00:03:58.269> not<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.419> overpowered<00:03:59.199> if

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
I it's really not that overpowered if

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.349 
I it's really not that overpowered if
you<00:03:59.379> ask<00:03:59.590> me<00:03:59.829> then<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.489> have<00:04:00.639> outrider<00:04:01.180> which

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
you ask me then we have outrider which

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.300 
you ask me then we have outrider which
has<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.750> sparrow<00:04:02.169> which<00:04:02.379> is<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> explosive

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
challenging to use but getting kills

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.020 
challenging to use but getting kills
with<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.019> is<00:04:11.139> really<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.680> satisfying<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
with it is really really satisfying the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
owl writer also has the vision pulse

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.899 
owl writer also has the vision pulse
which<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.799> like<00:04:14.949> a<00:04:14.979> little<00:04:15.220> mini<00:04:15.459> threat

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
which is like a little mini threat

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.490 
which is like a little mini threat
grenade<00:04:16.329> or<00:04:16.359> threat<00:04:16.720> detection<00:04:17.019> grenade<00:04:17.380> from

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
advanced warfare that goes off um and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.479 
advanced warfare that goes off um and
the<00:04:19.750> entire<00:04:20.079> game<00:04:20.380> knows<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.190> happens

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
the entire game knows that it happens

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.860 
the entire game knows that it happens
because<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:21.849> can<00:04:21.970> see<00:04:22.180> little<00:04:22.330> blips<00:04:22.690> of

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
because you can see little blips of

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.180 
because you can see little blips of
where<00:04:23.080> it's<00:04:23.229> stretching<00:04:23.470> out<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.889> on<00:04:24.070> the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
where it's stretching out to on the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.399 
where it's stretching out to on the
mini-map<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.729> if<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.479> hit<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.810> enemies<00:04:26.139> with

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
mini-map and if you hit the enemies with

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.899 
mini-map and if you hit the enemies with
your<00:04:26.620> vision<00:04:26.919> pulse<00:04:27.130> if<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.610> see<00:04:27.760> them

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
your vision pulse if you can see them

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.550 
your vision pulse if you can see them
through<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.120> wall<00:04:28.330> they<00:04:28.810> know<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.409> can

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
through a wall they know that you can

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.750 
through a wall they know that you can
see<00:04:29.650> them<00:04:29.770> because<00:04:29.889> they<00:04:30.130> will<00:04:30.250> light<00:04:30.460> up<00:04:30.610> red

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
see them because they will light up red

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.279 
see them because they will light up red
so<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.060> does<00:04:31.240> have<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.449> pretty<00:04:31.630> good<00:04:31.780> balance

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
so it does have a pretty good balance

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.050 
so it does have a pretty good balance
there<00:04:32.430> definitely<00:04:33.430> not<00:04:33.550> overpowered

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
there definitely not overpowered

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.300 
there definitely not overpowered
whatsoever<00:04:34.570> then<00:04:34.690> finally<00:04:35.080> we<00:04:35.470> have<00:04:35.710> ruin<00:04:36.099> who

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
whatsoever then finally we have ruin who

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.950 
whatsoever then finally we have ruin who
has<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.669> gravity<00:04:37.090> spikes<00:04:37.300> which<00:04:37.599> is<00:04:37.719> just

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
has the gravity spikes which is just

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.750 
has the gravity spikes which is just
