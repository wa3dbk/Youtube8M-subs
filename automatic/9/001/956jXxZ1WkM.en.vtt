beginning of 2011 I actually didn't have

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.160 
beginning of 2011 I actually didn't have
any<00:00:10.469> Azure<00:00:10.889> bags<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.730> my<00:00:11.790> collection<00:00:12.719> yet<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> I

any Azure bags in my collection yet so I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.629 
any Azure bags in my collection yet so I
wanted<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> get<00:00:13.710> something<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.219> spring<00:00:14.519> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
wanted to get something for spring and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.689 
wanted to get something for spring and
summer<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> decided<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> perfect

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
summer and so I decided that the perfect

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.179 
summer and so I decided that the perfect
bag<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:17.880> me<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:19.609> would<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:22.320> total<00:00:22.560> EMM

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
bag for me to get would be the total EMM

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.910 
bag for me to get would be the total EMM
size<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
size and I think that it's going to be a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
size and I think that it's going to be a
great<00:00:26.310> bag<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.890> use<00:00:29.099> kind<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> mommy<00:00:30.570> bag
