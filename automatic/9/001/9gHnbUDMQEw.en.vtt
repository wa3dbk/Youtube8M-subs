the<00:03:20.950> trail<00:03:21.190> mix<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:22.329> has<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> kind<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.870> cool

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
the trail mix and it has a kind of cool

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.379 
the trail mix and it has a kind of cool
yellow<00:03:24.459> lettering<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> don't<00:03:25.120> know<00:03:25.209> why<00:03:25.359> I

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
yellow lettering I don't know why I

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.670

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.039 
think that's so cool but I think it's
cool<00:03:26.919> because<00:03:27.639> most<00:03:27.910> other<00:03:28.090> items<00:03:28.419> have<00:03:28.599> white

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049
