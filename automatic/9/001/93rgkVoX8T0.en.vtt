00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.550
 hi all guys are objects 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.260
 wild willig are here with a new one 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.550
 video by citerna lincoln loster or a 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.990
 money glitches this time though 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.310
 you can do this glitch 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.440
 completely alone 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.029
 you also don't have to wait 48 minutes 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.529
 always if done obviously everything 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.720
 correctly so you can sell 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.240
 to infinity you will need apartment 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.189
 with a full garage also with vehicles 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.169
 taken of civilians or in any case two 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.630
 apartments with two garages that do not 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.130
 they can be full then you will need one 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.140
 maximum boosted vehicle anyway 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.149
 It is a vehicle that we have a value of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 changes because unfortunately this glee 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.680
 will give us the value of the changes and not 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.180
 the total value of the vehicle before 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.500
 continue I remind you to leave me 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.600
 like and start 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.240
 ok first you will have to buy 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.040
 various web meats no matter how many 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.410
 I personally took three rebel dogs 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.570
 in the garage where you are going to run the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.920
 glitches and where you have the vehicle 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.780
 to do the beach with 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.970
 so once you have ordered the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.290
 rebel canes of any color 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.230
 obviously I speak of the beautiful canera 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.089
 you need to wait for this one 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.730
 karin rebel arrive in the garage 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.370
 once he has arrived in the garage 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.380
 you have to move the vehicle with which 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.570
 you're going to glitch in the position 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.670
 where you see in the video 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.740
 this is very important therefore one 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.440
 once this is done you will have to open the internet 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.510
 go on vehicles and transport then you have to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.130
 go to the legendary site a lot of sports and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.990
 choose any vehicle from 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.840
 ordering, however, you don't have to order it 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.790
 you must stand still in the writing in which 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 asks you which apartment 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 you want to buy the vehicle when you are 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.409
 in the written one or in the writing 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.049
 in which he asks you which vehicle 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.940
 overwrite you will have to move this 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.549
 red cart in front we say to the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.159
 vehicle you are following the click with 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.470
 so that you can move it in short 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.210
 you simply have to copy what I do 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.970
 I'm doing in the video with this 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.950
 red cart you will initially do some 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.909
 of fatigue however it is once 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.890
 that you took the hand 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.990
 it will be really easy to move this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.909
 red cart then once that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.830
 you have moved the vehicle close to 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.000
 blue circle and not just above the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.409
 blue circle because otherwise not 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.030
 you can go up and into yours 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.640
 vehicle and therefore you cannot perform 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 this part of the glitch once done 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.830
 this you will have to practically enter the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 vehicle 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.030
 and in the middle and when your character 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.470
 halfway between the entrance and the door 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.300
 you must press the cross quickly 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.210
 directional right then once 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.000
 done that you will have to move the del torno 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.460
 where you are above with a rebel dog 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 once that is done accelerated outputs 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.850
 from the garage waiting for seconds and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.410
 then return c in reverse 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.940
 so when you're inside the garage 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.370
 you have to practically move the axis 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.220
 around better the vehicle you are from 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.570
 just got off with the other vehicle that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 you have just duplicated in this 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.480
 in case I practically exchange the 20 rounds 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.780
 then I repeat the same step with the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.880
 red cart and in fact halfway between 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.980
 the entrance to the door and the entrance to the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.050
 vehicle for the traditional cross 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.730
 hence always replace this one 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.350
 zen I return or better this vehicle with 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.080
 you are glitching with a canin 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.570
 revel therefore accelerated exits from 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.130
 garage this time wait 5 seconds 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.320
 and not two 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.180
 and then once you see it come in 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.540
 in the garage you practically have to exchange 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.120
 the area from which you came out with the other 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.800
 ze around that would be the original one 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.180
 I try to explain better you have to 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.739
 exchange vehicle you are just from 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 come out with the vehicle you have just 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.330
 duplicate thanks precisely to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.280
 overwritten or rebel in this 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.440
 if I see in the video I have 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 exchanged the square around with the third 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 Zen back and once you did 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.180
 this you have to re-run for the third time 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.489
 the step of the red cart I will try to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.019
 to explain it to let you precisely cup 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.360
 understand a little better how to do it a 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.700
 move this red cart to you 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.010
 you must always go with an inscription 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.660
 order because otherwise it does not move e 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.730
 so you have to go at it 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.830
 red cart and look for 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.170
 always move it close to the vehicle 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.120
 will always be able to drag the vehicle 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.260
 with which you are following the click and not 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.730
 you have to overdo it 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.410
 to put it over the blue circle 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.840
 because otherwise it will not work then 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.420
 do them the same thing ie enter with 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.370
 the character is halfway between the entry and 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.080
 the door press the cross quickly 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.940
 traditional right when you will be 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.669
 satisfied to perform this step 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.229
 you can do it as often as you like 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.669
 this case as you see the video I have it 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.470
 done three times 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.740
 you have to go to the santos customs e 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.289
 see that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.490
 from los santos customs when you sell the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.770
 vehicle 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.479
 if the price is not full then you can 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.449
 sell the vehicle but if the price 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.310
 piero you have wrong the displacement of the 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.889
 vehicles, however, do not panic because 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 however it is enough that you choose others 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.030
 vehicles that you have just duplicated 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.680
 compared to the original one 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.050
 at the flat price you don't have to sell 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.599
 so you will be able to do this 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.500
 step of the sale 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.199
 so if you did everything 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.310
 correctly sell the vehicle 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.000
 duplicate what is not exactly a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.220
 full price 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.470
 when you left the santos customs 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.389
 just call the mechanic and always 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.110
 from the mechanic you will have to request the 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.030
 vehicle that does not have the full price like 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.819
 you see in the video here is the first one 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.680
 the second while the third zen returned to the 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.690
 mechanic's menu is that fair price 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.580
 in fact I don't have to ask for it e 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.470
 so you can take all the vehicles 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.270
 that you have just published that not 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.130
 they are flat to the santos customs 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.110
 up to infinity the only thing that 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.490
 you'll have to wait just 4 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.229
 mechanic said this 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 guys please left a like 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.039
 it only takes second and click 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.930
 I like that brut button 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.849
 facebook page you go you will find it in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.440
