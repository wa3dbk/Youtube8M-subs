00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
backstory though and I liked what they

did with him and I thought he had the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.900 
did with him and I thought he had the
most<00:02:01.320> development<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> there's<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.550> little

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
most development and there's a little

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.640 
most development and there's a little
rift<00:02:03.210> between<00:02:03.390> actually<00:02:03.930> Jack<00:02:04.140> Frost<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.590> the

that was my idea um but I enjoyed
watching<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.270> thought<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.570> Jude<00:02:37.350> Law<00:02:37.560> as

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860

menacing and scary I thought Chris Pine

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
it looks and I think sometimes that may

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.810 
it looks and I think sometimes that may
have<00:03:12.750> also<00:03:12.930> hurt<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.440> story<00:03:14.190> because<00:03:14.610> it's

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
have also hurt the story because it's

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.580 
have also hurt the story because it's
very<00:03:15.150> stylists<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.200> looks<00:03:16.380> cool<00:03:16.500> in

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
very stylists that kind of looks cool in

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
very stylists that kind of looks cool in
the<00:03:16.680> 3d<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.070> absolutely<00:03:17.670> fantastic<00:03:18.300> in<00:03:18.420> this

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the 3d is absolutely fantastic in this

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.830 
the 3d is absolutely fantastic in this
movie<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.980> visually<00:03:20.720> breathtaking<00:03:21.720> at

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

times<00:03:21.870> watching<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.739> animation<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
times watching this animation that I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400 
times watching this animation that I
think<00:03:24.209> they<00:03:24.300> were<00:03:24.390> worried<00:03:24.840> about<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.170> shots

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
think they were worried about the shots

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
think they were worried about the shots
and<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.739> was<00:03:25.830> more<00:03:25.980> style<00:03:26.310> sometimes<00:03:26.820> over

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and it was more style sometimes over

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.510 
and it was more style sometimes over

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
just it's not one of those animation

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
just it's not one of those animation
movies<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.400> will<00:03:38.550> blow<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.760> away<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.360> you

movies that will blow you away and you

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.000 
movies that will blow you away and you
know<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> only<00:03:39.989> reiterate<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.769> many<00:03:40.860> times

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
know I only reiterate that so many times

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.729 
know I only reiterate that so many times
because<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.880> 3.5<00:03:42.690> out<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:42.959> 5<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.290> still

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
because of that 3.5 out of 5 I still

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.280 
because of that 3.5 out of 5 I still
thought<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.280> was<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> well-done<00:03:45.300> film<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:46.110> not
