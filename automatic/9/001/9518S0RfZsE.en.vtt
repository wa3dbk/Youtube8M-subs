buckles and now we are down to 27 so we

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.520

have<00:05:47.770> a<00:05:47.800> lot<00:05:48.040> of<00:05:48.160> problems<00:05:48.640> because<00:05:48.850> of<00:05:49.060> the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
have a lot of problems because of the

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.300 
have a lot of problems because of the
lab<00:05:49.450> we'll<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.930> coming<00:05:50.290> across<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:51.010> pressure

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
lab we'll be coming across the pressure

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.270 
lab we'll be coming across the pressure
of<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.760> water<00:05:51.910> for<00:05:52.690> us<00:05:52.810> ground<00:05:53.470> level<00:05:53.920> is<00:05:54.040> very

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
of the water for us ground level is very

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.340 
of the water for us ground level is very
good<00:05:54.730> because<00:05:54.910> most<00:05:55.330> of<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.660> big<00:05:55.840> buildings

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
good because most of the big buildings

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.970 
good because most of the big buildings
use<00:05:57.010> bumps<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:59.020> only<00:05:59.320> way<00:05:59.470> we<00:05:59.680> have<00:05:59.710> been

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
use bumps the only way we have been

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980 
use bumps the only way we have been
saved<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.700> because<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.090> roads<00:06:01.480> are<00:06:01.720> very<00:06:01.750> narrow

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
saved is because I roads are very narrow

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.790 
saved is because I roads are very narrow
so<00:06:02.860> that<00:06:03.040> means<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.580> jobs<00:06:03.850> cannot<00:06:04.300> come<00:06:04.570> in

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
so that means that jobs cannot come in

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
so that means that jobs cannot come in
but<00:06:05.800> that's<00:06:05.890> you<00:06:06.160> need<00:06:06.430> that<00:06:06.970> obviously<00:06:07.840> you

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
but that's you need that obviously you

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.780 
but that's you need that obviously you
want<00:06:08.230> to<00:06:08.290> change<00:06:08.590> because<00:06:08.890> I<00:06:09.130> come<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.640> we'll

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
want to change because I come and we'll

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.090 
want to change because I come and we'll
make<00:06:09.940> that<00:06:09.970> I<00:06:10.150> can<00:06:10.420> move<00:06:10.570> where<00:06:10.930> rule<00:06:11.590> letting

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
make that I can move where rule letting

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.130 
make that I can move where rule letting
him<00:06:12.250> destroy<00:06:12.400> part<00:06:13.000> of<00:06:13.120> my<00:06:13.300> house<00:06:13.480> and<00:06:13.810> say<00:06:13.960> the

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
him destroy part of my house and say the

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.530 
him destroy part of my house and say the
BBC<00:06:14.590> divide<00:06:14.950> through<00:06:15.310> that's<00:06:15.910> what<00:06:16.090> we<00:06:16.390> can

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
BBC divide through that's what we can

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.660 
BBC divide through that's what we can
build<00:06:16.840> on<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:17.320> reach<00:06:17.710> out<00:06:17.890> in<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.130> future

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
build on it and reach out in the future

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.220 
build on it and reach out in the future
so<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.270> doesn't<00:06:19.480> mean<00:06:19.750> that<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:20.050> have<00:06:20.200> to

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
so that doesn't mean that you have to

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.790 
so that doesn't mean that you have to
destroy<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.800> past<00:06:21.240> do<00:06:22.240> we<00:06:22.420> love<00:06:23.140> it<00:06:23.350> preserve

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
destroy the past do we love it preserve

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
destroy the past do we love it preserve
the<00:06:24.070> past<00:06:24.570> whatever<00:06:25.570> it<00:06:25.870> is<00:06:26.110> whenever<00:06:27.100> it<00:06:27.400> is<00:06:27.460> a
