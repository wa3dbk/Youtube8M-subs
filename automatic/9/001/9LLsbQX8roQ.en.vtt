 os apoios zoila rapunzel de disney 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 rapunzel of dislates you will ask 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.400
 some then if it turns out that before 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 walt disney company produjese enredados 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 had in mind with my name and today 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 many of you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.000
 concretely you will know what you do not 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.779
 tell yourself what Disney does not tell you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.730
 probably some peasant the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 alphabet of the medieval era or several of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 they one day decided to start 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 tell your children stories for 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 lecturing about life the problem 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.279
 is that today children are born with one in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 time of four under the arm but for 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 that moment unless you can son of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.250
 someone from royalty the only thing 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.660
 you could have shipments under it 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 and that the birth that area is not yet 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 populated good for this reason children 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 peasants had to live a reality 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 very hard to work hard to get into 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 the dangerous and dark forests and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 habitually going hungry 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.000
 that is why these stories told them 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 his parents were very hard and ruthless 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 to teach them to have respect and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
 fear for life let's say it was 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.980
 long after two gentlemen 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 the brothers jacob and will on green 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 They decided to go collecting all those 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 stories that could be heard in the mouth and now 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.570
 they were versioning them a bit already 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 that bourgeois high society 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 the time or the fixed and rich people to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.150
 those who would later sell these stories 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 they were scandalized with the events 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 narrated in something supposedly childish 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.430
 and despite that already the versions of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 grimm were quite darker than 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 that the Disney tells us and today I 'm going to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.940
 tell how the story was exactly 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.460
 of my life a long time ago in the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.290
 medieval germany there was a rapunzel she 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 She was not a princess like me, but a daughter of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 some peasants and was delivered by their 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.580
 parents to an old witch in exchange for 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.200
 food 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.090
 specifically the vegetables called rap 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.190
 on goats in Spanish that are a type of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.960
 turnips and that in German they are called rapunzel 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.759
 is taking into account that none of this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.140
 happened in the Disney version to me 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.450
 they put the name of spikes without 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 I motivate my disney princess made me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 birth but for the rebound the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.850
 original the only opportunity to enter 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.350
 in contact with royalty was when a 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.300
 Prince discovered her in the tower in the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.830
 that the witch had her locked up all there 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.060
 What to say - the country must be very 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.950
 little populated so that the very same 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.050
 Prince was going to give just that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.330
 tower that was hidden the need to 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.979
 the prince is lucky and my namesake is 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.690
 they gathered behind the witch's back during 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.690
 the nights that was when the old woman did not 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 I was 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.700
 let's say that during those nights 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.860
 the couple did not talk about time 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.540
 there are precisely many versions that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.190
 explain that he rapunzel was finally 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 discovered by the witch for numerous 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.730
 such confusions as the old woman saw 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 to the prince in the morning coming down from the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 tower just before she arrived or 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.800
 comments that escaped the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.600
 long-haired maiden in front of the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.490
 witch but one of the most 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.470
 old and probably the original 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.330
 account that rapunzel was discovered by 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.970
 the witch when her belly reached a 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.790
 obvious and significant size had been 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.550
 past eating sweets was not 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.350
 pregnant the angered witch cut the 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.390
 rapunzel's long mane and tied it to the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.520
 window of the tower and both went down 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.010
 the hair songs took the young 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.690
 away from there and later waited for the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.940
 Prince's visit that logically 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.590
 I did not know what happened to the prince as 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.540
 always went up the hair without knowing 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.160
 that was cut and once above 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 He found the witch that after some 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.540
 unkind words pushed him tower 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 down 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.439
 the prince fell on some letters that 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.689
 They amortized their fall but also 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.670
 damaged his eyes leaving him blind but 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.379
 this did not put a problem for him and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.420
 he looked for rapunzel through the length and 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.579
 width of the kingdom until it finally gave 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.799
 with her I say again that the kingdom does not 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.239
 It must be too big, that's how it is 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.890
 it took some years because when the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.840
 I would find I was already in the company of 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.129
 his two twin sons good there 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.739
 versions that speak of a single child 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.120
 I guess it was easier to produce 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.620
 as a replacement I had feelings and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.540
 those things when he found that the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.129
 prince was blind and gold and one of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.500
 those tears that I about the prince 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.090
 our in that scene only that this 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.709
 tear did not fall on her cheeks 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.870
 loved as it happened to me with the end 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 human the accomplice in the human the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.340
 bandit uncle that in blood over 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.019
 rapunzel fell the prince's eyes and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.939
 the result that this caused you what 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.620
 you can imagine for the rest 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.540
 the ending was just as happy and cloying 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 that of my movie and that's it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.900
 Many of you will know the story but 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.030
 others not so I hope that I have 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.109
 it seemed interesting now I leave you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.669
 I have been to picnic with 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.900
 rapunzel the moon cell and the little mermaid 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.900
 lesbian until soon
