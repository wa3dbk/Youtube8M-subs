00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.980

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.559
 is here for the other day ask for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 twitter that charlene so challenges or 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.269
 you would like us to record for 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.850
 the channel since it was around here and what 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.850
 more you put me was the mixed 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 so we're going to do it but we're going to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 adapt to make it a bit more 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.080
 literary she's going to be the one to paint me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 me I know of your blank canvas and for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.000
 do it literary as I say in these 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 papers we have typical things of some 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.809
 characters such as the scar 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 from harry potter we say more so that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.520
 be surprise and in those that have file 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
 parts of the face or neck appear 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.300
 that I do not have to paint what 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800
 show up here I think she's going to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 have to choose what to do in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.780
 all these paintings that you do not 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 you have but they are arriving 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.210
 then it is not the great arsenal so 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.719
 I'm going to have to progress with the most 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.719
 easy 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 that's 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.490
 this is the illuminator that was put in 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.570
 club I would like to be able to do you the most 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 seemed the reality 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:33.250
 take a knife we ​​do not let you say 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.390
 a lot of good time then I know 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 perfectly how it is done 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.920
 a person who does not know how to be still 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.920
 you look like leguía 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 or not 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.440
 do not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.680
 very good 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 Now let's make button eyes 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.630
 of coraline that if they do not fall on the eyes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.790
 It gives me something you know how is the eyes of 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.860
 Neil Gaiman book button that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.620
 even on the other side of the characters 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 they meet and they have eyes and we are going to 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.060
 do in the trade 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.380
 the shirt 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.950
 I notice the drool of the dwarf 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.370
 pink rose 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.160
 wrong 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.209
 because I will not look at the screen 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.290
 that is delayed much more than more than 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.270
 the birds of 3 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.390
 that is the front and that space we put 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.390
 here 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.680
 very beautiful 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.860

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.860

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.930
 if both relatives my mouth would be so 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.290
 proud 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.290
