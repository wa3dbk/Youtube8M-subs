00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
was a pretty interesting concept due to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.940 
was a pretty interesting concept due to
the<00:00:42.750> fact<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.680> class

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the fact that one of these are class

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.180 
the fact that one of these are class
mods<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> newer<00:00:46.079> trailers<00:00:46.680> the
