done this move this bit of the inside
hand<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> hand<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.230> come<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:49.829> instead

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
hand to hand when we come back instead

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.020 
hand to hand when we come back instead
of<00:00:50.430> doing<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> hitch<00:00:51.649> kick<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.039> land<00:00:53.610> with

this<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.410> considerable<00:00:56.190> distance<00:00:56.610> between

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this this considerable distance between

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
this this considerable distance between
us<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> make<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.559> make<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
us I'm going to make up make up the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.810 
us I'm going to make up make up the
difference<00:00:59.190> by<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.390> kick<00:01:01.050> hitch<00:01:01.770> kick<00:01:01.820> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
difference by going kick hitch kick and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.679 
difference by going kick hitch kick and
come<00:01:03.719> closer<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> Tara<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.070> close<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> gap<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
come closer to Tara I close that gap and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.320 
come closer to Tara I close that gap and
then<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.619> come<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.000> hand

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
then as I come around with my hand

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
then as I come around with my hand
connection<00:01:09.689> instead<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.680> being<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
connection instead of being here which I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
connection instead of being here which I
would<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> were<00:01:12.360> far<00:01:12.570> away<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:13.140> stepped
