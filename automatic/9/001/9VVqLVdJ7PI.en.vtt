the<00:00:13.230> spaceship-1<00:00:13.590> program<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> very

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the spaceship-1 program is a very

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.150 
the spaceship-1 program is a very
demanding<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:16.020> lots<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.470> trials<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
demanding one we had lots of trials and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.220 
demanding one we had lots of trials and
issues<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> vehicles<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
issues with the vehicles so the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.630 
issues with the vehicles so the
mothership<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.830> rocket<00:00:20.160> motor<00:00:20.310> the

mothership the rocket motor the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.820 
mothership the rocket motor the
spaceship<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:22.109> had<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> lot<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> luck<00:00:22.650> as

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
spaceship and we had a lot of luck as

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.790 
spaceship and we had a lot of luck as
well<00:00:23.119> by<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.480> Mike<00:00:24.750> Malvo<00:00:25.350> got<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> his

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
well by the time Mike Malvo got to his

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700 
well by the time Mike Malvo got to his
first<00:00:26.099> space<00:00:26.640> attempt<00:00:27.180> I'm<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.320> firm

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
first space attempt I'm a pretty firm

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
first space attempt I'm a pretty firm
believer<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> Paul<00:00:29.460> Allen<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.029> have

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
believer that Paul Allen would have

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
believer that Paul Allen would have
lobbied<00:00:30.869> hard<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> say<00:00:31.380> hey<00:00:31.529> let's<00:00:31.710> end<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
lobbied hard to say hey let's end this

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
lobbied hard to say hey let's end this
effort<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> high<00:00:32.969> note<00:00:33.000> Burt<00:00:33.870> Rutan<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
effort on a high note Burt Rutan kind of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
effort on a high note Burt Rutan kind of
got<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.100> he<00:00:35.250> needed<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.120> program<00:00:36.450> he

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
got what he needed out of the program he

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740 
got what he needed out of the program he
put<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.200> commercial<00:00:37.710> person<00:00:38.399> into<00:00:38.610> space<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
put a commercial person into space so I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.240 
put a commercial person into space so I
think<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:40.200> those<00:00:40.440> individuals<00:00:41.070> would<00:00:41.190> be

think both those individuals would be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.180 
think both those individuals would be
satisfied<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.480> program<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
satisfied for the program was and it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
satisfied for the program was and it
took<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.300> big<00:00:45.750> carrot<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> platter

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
ready to go and present it to get the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.049 
ready to go and present it to get the
attention<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> both<00:00:50.280> those<00:00:50.460> individuals<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
attention of both those individuals to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
attention of both those individuals to
carry<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.449> program<00:00:51.840> forward<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> allow

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
carry that program forward and allow

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
carry that program forward and allow
those<00:00:52.710> flights<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> happen<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.300> it

they're all financed by well-heeled

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
they're all financed by well-heeled

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
individuals that don't need taxpayer

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139 
individuals that don't need taxpayer
money<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.009> make<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.060> do

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
money to make what they want to do

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.719 
money to make what they want to do
happen<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.640> were

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
happen and if one or two of them were

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
happen and if one or two of them were
successful<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.140> opens

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
successful then I think it really opens

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.730 
successful then I think it really opens
the<00:02:04.740> door<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.130> other<00:02:05.250> people<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> follow

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the door for other people to follow

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.889 
the door for other people to follow
I'm<00:02:06.860> encouraged<00:02:07.670> by<00:02:07.790> what<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> see<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.630> think

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
I'm encouraged by what I see and I think

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.660 
I'm encouraged by what I see and I think
it's<00:02:09.110> certainly<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.860> right<00:02:09.920> thing<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.520> it's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
it's certainly the right thing and it's

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's certainly the right thing and it's
long<00:02:10.910> overdue<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.599> all<00:02:12.110> my<00:02:12.410> friends<00:02:12.650> at<00:02:13.069> NASA

that's sort of the common denominator

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.500 
that's sort of the common denominator

with all these people they go up there

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.360 
with all these people they go up there
once<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.840> want<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.080> go<00:02:21.140> back<00:02:21.319> again<00:02:21.500> they<00:02:22.340> are

once you want to go back again they are

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.070 
once you want to go back again they are

looking to the private sector to make

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.229 
looking to the private sector to make
that<00:02:24.260> happen<00:02:24.580> we're<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> threshold<00:02:26.000> of

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
that happen we're on the threshold of

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.059 
that happen we're on the threshold of
commercial<00:02:26.630> flights<00:02:26.840> whatever<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.530> FAA

commercial flights whatever the FAA

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.100 
commercial flights whatever the FAA
landscape<00:02:28.849> might<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.630> allow<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.870> to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
landscape might be to allow that to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.580 
landscape might be to allow that to
happen

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
happen

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.949 
happen
I<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> floodgates<00:02:31.940> start<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
I think that the floodgates start to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.900 
I think that the floodgates start to
open<00:02:33.080> up<00:02:33.380> we're<00:02:33.890> gonna<00:02:34.069> see<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.519> lot<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.760> people

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
open up we're gonna see a lot of people

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.030 
open up we're gonna see a lot of people
flying<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.690> word-of-mouth<00:02:36.050> experience<00:02:36.769> of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
flying the word-of-mouth experience of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.190 
flying the word-of-mouth experience of
going<00:02:37.519> up<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.510> self

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
going up there is going to be a self

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.440 
going up there is going to be a self
selling<00:02:39.620> market<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.489> don't<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:40.880> virgins

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
selling market I don't think virgins

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.640 
selling market I don't think virgins
gonna<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.900> spend<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.170> whole<00:02:42.290> lot<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.470> money

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
gonna have to spend a whole lot of money

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.900 
gonna have to spend a whole lot of money
at<00:02:42.830> marketing<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.370> at<00:02:43.549> all

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
at marketing this at all

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.880 
at marketing this at all
I<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.600> other<00:02:45.110> people<00:02:45.470> are<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.799> get

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I think other people are going to get

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.500 
I think other people are going to get
into<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> arena<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.940> where<00:02:47.360> there's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
into the arena because where there's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
into the arena because where there's
money<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:47.930> made<00:02:48.200> competition<00:02:49.040> that

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
money to be made competition that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.640 
money to be made competition that
naturally<00:02:49.790> surfaces<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.019> think<00:02:51.260> we'll

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
naturally surfaces and so I think we'll

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
naturally surfaces and so I think we'll
see<00:02:51.860> competing<00:02:52.370> space<00:02:53.030> line<00:02:53.239> operators

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
see competing space line operators

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.780 
see competing space line operators
within<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> US<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.160> soon<00:02:55.340> globally

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
within the US and soon globally

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.360 
within the US and soon globally
providing<00:02:56.780> these<00:02:56.930> kinds<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.560> services<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.220> I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
providing these kinds of services and I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.009 
providing these kinds of services and I
think<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.030> next<00:02:59.239> five<00:02:59.420> years<00:02:59.450> that's

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
think in the next five years that's

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.289 
think in the next five years that's
entirely<00:03:00.590> possible<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.340> with<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.940> becomes

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
entirely possible and with it becomes

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.970 
entirely possible and with it becomes
the<00:03:02.450> hope<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.630> we<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.410> extend<00:03:03.769> this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the hope that we can extend this

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.309 
the hope that we can extend this
capability<00:03:04.190> beyond<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.720> suborbital

capability beyond just the suborbital
lob<00:03:06.680> shots<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.370> we<00:03:07.489> offer<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:08.030> something<00:03:08.420> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
lob shots that we offer to something a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.509 
lob shots that we offer to something a
bit<00:03:08.599> more<00:03:08.780> extensive<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.799> can<00:03:09.980> get<00:03:10.130> into<00:03:10.370> orbit

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
bit more extensive we can get into orbit

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.910 
bit more extensive we can get into orbit
and<00:03:10.820> we<00:03:10.910> can<00:03:11.120> put<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> destination<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.560> orbit

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
and we can put a destination in orbit

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.979 
and we can put a destination in orbit
