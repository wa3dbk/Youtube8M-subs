far<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.160> moto<00:00:17.369> goggles<00:00:17.850> go<00:00:18.090> probably<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.109> one

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
far as moto goggles go probably some one

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.420 
far as moto goggles go probably some one
of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> biggest<00:00:19.590> things<00:00:19.920> that's<00:00:20.070> happened<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
of the biggest things that's happened to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.460 
of the biggest things that's happened to
goggle<00:00:20.640> since<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> he<00:00:21.359> arrived<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.869> suppose<00:00:22.199> as

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
goggle since the he arrived I suppose as

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.210 
goggle since the he arrived I suppose as
you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.480> frameless<00:00:24.869> lens<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you can see it's a frameless lens so the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.410 
you can see it's a frameless lens so the
frame<00:00:26.910> essentially<00:00:27.510> makes<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:30.210> back

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
frame essentially makes up the the back

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
frame essentially makes up the the back
of<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> lens<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> lens<00:00:31.560> sets<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
of the lens but the lens sets as the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
of the lens but the lens sets as the
whole<00:00:32.940> front<00:00:33.329> piece<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> gives<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
whole front piece what that gives you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
whole front piece what that gives you
obviously<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.090> vision<00:00:36.329> you've

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
obviously is really good vision you've

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
obviously is really good vision you've

got amazing peripheral vision on this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
got amazing peripheral vision on this

made<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.030> four-layer<00:01:06.659> foam<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.950> you've

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
made up of a four-layer foam so you've

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
made up of a four-layer foam so you've
got<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.310> fleecy<00:01:08.880> layer<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.299> makes<00:01:09.510> contact

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
got your fleecy layer that makes contact

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
got your fleecy layer that makes contact
with<00:01:10.049> your<00:01:10.260> face<00:01:10.530> after<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.640> you've<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
with your face after that you've got the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.390 
with your face after that you've got the
spongy<00:01:12.570> layer<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.170> helps<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> goggles<00:01:14.130> sit

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
spongy layer that helps the goggles sit

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
spongy layer that helps the goggles sit
on<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.670> face<00:01:14.880> properly<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.780> around<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> nose

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
on your face properly so around the nose

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
on your face properly so around the nose
and<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> sides<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.549> face<00:01:17.759> gives

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and around the sides of your face gives

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
and around the sides of your face gives
you<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.330> coverage<00:01:19.009> then<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.280> next<00:01:20.430> layer

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you good coverage then your next layer

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
you good coverage then your next layer
is<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> harder<00:01:21.360> layer<00:01:21.570> which<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.869> essentially

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
is a harder layer which is essentially

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
is a harder layer which is essentially
deals<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> sweat<00:01:23.220> factor<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.600> again

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
deals with a sweat factor and then again

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
deals with a sweat factor and then again
that<00:01:25.170> harder<00:01:25.470> layer<00:01:25.650> sits<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> slightly

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that harder layer sits on a slightly

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
that harder layer sits on a slightly
softer<00:01:26.790> layer<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.650> gives<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> little

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
softer layer that just gives a little

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.289 
softer layer that just gives a little
bit<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> flexibility<00:01:29.880> onto<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> frame<00:01:30.630> itself

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
bit of flexibility onto the frame itself

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
bit of flexibility onto the frame itself
the<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.720> lens<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.770> easy<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.250> off

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the the lens is really easy to get off

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
the the lens is really easy to get off
at<00:01:35.729> pops<00:01:36.509> off<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.140> end<00:01:37.350> you'll<00:01:37.530> see

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
at pops off on one end you'll see

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.020 
at pops off on one end you'll see
there's<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.250> recess<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you go she's gone the goggle is also

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.950 
you go she's gone the goggle is also
available<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.290> roll<00:01:46.649> off<00:01:46.829> system<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> role

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
available in a roll off system the role

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.469 
available in a roll off system the role
of<00:01:48.990> system<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.799> obviously<00:01:50.549> something<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.299> can
