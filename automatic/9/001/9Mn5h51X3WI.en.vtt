00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.030
 I categorically welcome you all with 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 you domanova 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.859
 and today we look just super 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.770
 beautiful fight I don't know maybe he 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.240
 made of course not super good but damn 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.850
 well he just 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.990
 in general let's see i'm not inside 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.000
 I expected that there will be a video I just 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 did mounted previous 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 Well, probably there will be a gap of time 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 to drive for two days in general I don’t know 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.860
 I’m going to write this setup 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:47.340
 we have one person 2000 fights and efficiency have but 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.399
 400 now I'll show this type in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 overall it is bad 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:57.320
 aber hurt blast punch well come on you 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.510
 start gasping and groaning 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 forget our guys shoot down and the very first 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 melts the rule is not the very first but all 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.010
 the same should be the way here, I wrote comrade 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 I just want to discuss this 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.590
 wrote comrade that in 2000 is no longer 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.439
 I stuff with this categorically not 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.140
 I agree because I have two thousand fights 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.580
 and I have my efficiency rating 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.500
 equal to number 1260 I think indicators 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
 not bad up for just the same for two 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 thousand okay this is all Ponte move to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.689
 battles actually this form dare to go 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 as standard I developed here for 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.409
 I myself do not know such a mini tactic at the beginning 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.009
 I drop in on moz and then look through 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.649
 if there is anyone there and then 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.280
 shoot left right and start already 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.250
 how are you now look like 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.250
 opponents begin to disperse as 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.890
 our guys merge they merge when 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.150
 I'm already starting to act more 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 specifically here I notice t21 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:12.560
 I don't seem to be such a person anymore 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.780
 show unlucky domnin produces 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.900
 wbp semi 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.480
 here finish him and here I look like 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.490
 I will see what you see seeing 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.440
 towers turned means everything is fine here I 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.460
 did not know that there will be and 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 lucky you see, I punched here I 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.600
 ammunition of course to what because 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.470
 if he subjugated I would no longer exist 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.550
 perform 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.209
 and standard error dies slowly 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.750
 I guess just the same opponents 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.820
 are needed 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.030
 so you see we are going to horror 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.090
 just us make out our our all but not 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.220
 team trouble is dima nila how are you 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 know who has a hardcore feature 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.459
 mode and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.430
 and in this function I do not know my 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.470
 Subscribers know for sure here are the new guys 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.660
 probably doesn't know well actually not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.350
 scary i think this is not the last video 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.560

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.470

 I choose a goal and better here I have 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.070
 I have an avatar, so now I thought 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.140
 I thought everything but I oh I'm just that 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.300
 imagine the feeling of a person who 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.480
 one against a huge number of tanks 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.360
 lich some damage but that already nothing 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.040
 It could be done either do 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.110
 two shots 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 damage or drive off and fight 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.940
 to last for to last 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.370
 sigh as i did here i get 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.550
 last bullet in the caterpillar adore this 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 tank I learned to play like that 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.310
 almost no one breaks me here 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.100
 I will try my luck punch my 6 him 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.000
 I'm breaking through all the regime of Dima Nella 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:02.480
 turned on rage like bill yard seven 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.960

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.930

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.810
 rage mode like my arsenal teeth 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.450
 close friends know who played with me in 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.430

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.200
 wise guy on the harp how are dogs made 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.449
 I succeed in this, I know that for the sake of 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.280
 I 'm not fast anymore 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.979

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.199
 I thought the first went where 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.449
 to 5 but after looking a little further I 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.460
 I notice that you now highlight notice 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.050
