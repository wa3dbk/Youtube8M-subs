00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so the next time she said I was hoping

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.980 
so the next time she said I was hoping
that<00:02:01.680> things<00:02:01.830> would<00:02:02.040> go<00:02:02.190> better

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
that things would go better

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.330 
that things would go better
unfortunately<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.140> did<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.500> she<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.130> still

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
shedding in lots of little pieces and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
shedding in lots of little pieces and
her<00:02:07.710> eye<00:02:07.740> caps<00:02:08.190> weren't<00:02:08.580> coming<00:02:08.850> off<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.210> she

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
her eye caps weren't coming off and she

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
her eye caps weren't coming off and she
was<00:02:09.420> still<00:02:09.630> getting<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.899> build<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.380> right

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
was still getting that build up right

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.090 
was still getting that build up right
around<00:02:10.890> her<00:02:11.130> nose<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> had<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.770> more<00:02:13.950> idea

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
around her nose so I had one more idea

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.830 
around her nose so I had one more idea
before<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.730> took<00:02:14.820> her<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.330> vet<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.750> her

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
before I took her to the vet to get her

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
before I took her to the vet to get her
check<00:02:16.050> down<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.880> use<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> product<00:02:18.180> called<00:02:18.330> xango

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
check down I use a product called xango

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.630 
check down I use a product called xango
on<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:18.990> daily<00:02:19.200> basis<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> used<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.310> my<00:02:20.430> own

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
on a daily basis that I used for my own

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520 
on a daily basis that I used for my own
health<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.120> I'd<00:02:21.780> had<00:02:21.959> pretty<00:02:22.140> good<00:02:22.260> results

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
health and I'd had pretty good results

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.670 
health and I'd had pretty good results
with<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.970> read<00:02:24.720> several<00:02:24.990> stories<00:02:25.410> about

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
with it and I read several stories about

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.410 
with it and I read several stories about
people<00:02:25.860> using<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.520> sick<00:02:26.760> animals<00:02:27.240> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
people using it on sick animals and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.570 
people using it on sick animals and
they'd<00:02:28.290> had<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:28.740> good<00:02:28.860> results<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
they'd had really good results with that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.280 
they'd had really good results with that
so<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> thought<00:02:30.560> okay<00:02:31.560> all<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.820> juice

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so I thought okay all it is it's a juice

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.630 
so I thought okay all it is it's a juice
comes<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.470> bottle<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.010> looks<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.340> like

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
comes in a bottle it looks just like

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
comes in a bottle it looks just like
this<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.930> mangosteen<00:02:37.260> juice<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.860> just<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
this it's a mangosteen juice it's just a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.210 
this it's a mangosteen juice it's just a
fruit<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:40.140> safe<00:02:40.320> for<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:40.830> anything

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
fruit it's safe for just about anything

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.460 
fruit it's safe for just about anything
so<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.880> thought<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> heck<00:02:42.930> I'll<00:02:43.260> give<00:02:43.440> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so I thought what the heck I'll give it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.860 
so I thought what the heck I'll give it
a<00:02:43.590> try<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.459> probably<00:02:44.850> isn't<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.239> hurt<00:02:45.360> so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
a try it probably isn't going to hurt so

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.229 
a try it probably isn't going to hurt so
the<00:02:46.500> next<00:02:46.680> time<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.010> fed<00:02:47.250> her<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.520> put<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> few

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the next time I fed her I put a few

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.090 
the next time I fed her I put a few
drops<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.720> mouse<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.140> put<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.470> her<00:02:49.560> cage<00:02:49.800> I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
drops on the mouse I put in her cage I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100 
drops on the mouse I put in her cage I
keep<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.000> mind<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.450> try<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.720> use<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
keep in mind if you do try this use a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.020 
keep in mind if you do try this use a
very<00:02:52.410> small<00:02:52.530> amount<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.430> does<00:02:53.820> work

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
very small amount because it does work

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870 
very small amount because it does work
very<00:02:54.060> well<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.690> small<00:02:54.930> amounts<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.700> saw<00:02:56.700> almost

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
very well in small amounts I saw almost

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.479 
very well in small amounts I saw almost
an<00:02:57.120> immediate<00:02:57.540> improvement<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.140> her<00:02:58.489> she's

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
an immediate improvement in her she's

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.100 
an immediate improvement in her she's
more<00:02:59.700> active<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.120> her<00:03:00.180> cage<00:03:00.420> moving<00:03:00.870> around

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
more active in her cage moving around

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.229 
more active in her cage moving around
and<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:02.040> type<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.310> makes<00:03:02.610> she<00:03:02.790> does<00:03:02.940> tend<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and this type of makes she does tend to

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.750 
and this type of makes she does tend to
be<00:03:03.300> pretty<00:03:03.480> active<00:03:03.870> especially<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.470> night<00:03:04.760> so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
be pretty active especially at night so

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.840 
be pretty active especially at night so
I<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.360> definitely<00:03:06.840> feeling<00:03:07.019> hopeful<00:03:07.850> next

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
I was definitely feeling hopeful next

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.310 
I was definitely feeling hopeful next
time<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.090> fed<00:03:09.299> her<00:03:09.420> did<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> same<00:03:09.870> thing<00:03:09.900> few

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
time I fed her did the same thing few

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.340 
time I fed her did the same thing few
drops<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.769> mouse<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.780> waited<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.870> she<00:03:12.989> was

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
still feeling fairly energetic so the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.840 
still feeling fairly energetic so the
real<00:03:16.470> test<00:03:16.739> came<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> next<00:03:17.310> time<00:03:17.580> she<00:03:17.760> was

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
real test came the next time she was

real test came the next time she was
going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.150> shed<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.140> waited<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
going to shed so I waited and the

morning<00:03:20.760> after<00:03:20.880> she'd<00:03:21.239> shed<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.750> could<00:03:22.320> tell

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
morning after she'd shed I could tell

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.949
