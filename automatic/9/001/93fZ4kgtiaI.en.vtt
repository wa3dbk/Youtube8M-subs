Iron Fist company by barbarians that are
surrounding<00:00:35.250> him<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.329> Barb's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
surrounding him if you don't have Barb's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.750 
surrounding him if you don't have Barb's
then<00:00:37.410> they're<00:00:37.680> gonna<00:00:37.800> spawn<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
then they're gonna spawn some for you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
then they're gonna spawn some for you
and<00:00:38.989> they're<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.110> help<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.620> King<00:00:40.860> out

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and they're gonna help the King out

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
and they're gonna help the King out
while<00:00:41.489> he's<00:00:41.700> attacking<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.600> sort<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
while he's attacking and it's sort of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.760 
while he's attacking and it's sort of
like<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.190> small<00:00:44.190> rage<00:00:44.460> mode<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.379> did<00:00:46.590> some

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
like a small rage mode now I did some

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.090 
like a small rage mode now I did some
math<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.180> seems<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.739> Iron<00:00:49.980> Fist

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
math and it seems if the Iron Fist

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
math and it seems if the Iron Fist
ability<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.739> ranked<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.890> every<00:00:53.460> 5<00:00:53.699> levels<00:00:54.239> for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
ability is ranked up every 5 levels for

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
ability is ranked up every 5 levels for
the<00:00:55.020> King<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> means<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.370> level<00:00:56.670> 40

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the King then that means at level 40

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.410 
the King then that means at level 40
he's<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.930> Iron<00:00:58.170> Fist<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.649> rank<00:00:58.890> 8

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
he's gonna have the Iron Fist at rank 8

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
he's gonna have the Iron Fist at rank 8
but<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.570> supercell<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.079> anything<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
but if supercell is anything like a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.969 
but if supercell is anything like a
balanced<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.739> they're<00:01:04.739> gonna<00:01:04.890> have

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
balanced game then they're gonna have

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
balanced game then they're gonna have
that<00:01:05.519> thing<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.840> level<00:01:07.110> 10<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that thing go up to level 10 as the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840 
that thing go up to level 10 as the
highest<00:01:09.540> level<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.110> sure<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> would

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
highest level I'm sure so that would

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.160 
highest level I'm sure so that would
mean<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> king<00:01:12.360> would<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> level

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
mean the king would have to go to level

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
mean the king would have to go to level
50<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.520> speculation<00:01:14.820> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
50 so this is just my speculation but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
50 so this is just my speculation but
I'd<00:01:15.540> feel<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.290> king<00:01:16.560> probably<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.220> be

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I'd feel the king probably will be

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
I'd feel the king probably will be
upgraded<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> level<00:01:18.060> 50<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:19.470> soon<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.330> just

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
upgraded to level 50 pretty soon I just

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
upgraded to level 50 pretty soon I just
feel<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> heroes<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
feel the heroes are going in that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
feel the heroes are going in that
direction<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.840> suggestion<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
direction so that's just my suggestion I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
direction so that's just my suggestion I
that's<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.490> opinion<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.939> think

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that's that's just my opinion I think

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's that's just my opinion I think
that<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.990> heroes<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.619> upgrading<00:01:29.610> soon

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that the heroes will be upgrading soon

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.469 
that the heroes will be upgrading soon
and<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.320> could<00:01:31.530> guess<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.070> feel<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.060> archer

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and if I could guess I feel the archer

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
and if I could guess I feel the archer
Queen<00:01:33.720> might<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> some<00:01:34.380> sort<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> special

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
Queen might get some sort of special

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.850 
Queen might get some sort of special
ability<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.299> thinking<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:36.869> might<00:01:37.079> spawn

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ability to I'm thinking they might spawn

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
ability to I'm thinking they might spawn
some<00:01:38.159> archers<00:01:38.579> around<00:01:38.909> her<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.360> she<00:01:39.780> could

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
some archers around her and she could

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
some archers around her and she could
have<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.070> maybe<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> status<00:01:41.820> booth

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
have I don't know maybe a status booth

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.649 
have I don't know maybe a status booth
where<00:01:42.509> she<00:01:42.720> gets<00:01:43.079> us<00:01:43.350> higher<00:01:44.220> speed<00:01:44.700> maybe<00:01:45.450> her

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
where she gets us higher speed maybe her

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.649 
where she gets us higher speed maybe her
speed<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.710> she<00:01:47.460> does<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> charge<00:01:48.090> shot

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
speed goes up or she does a charge shot

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.719 
speed goes up or she does a charge shot
you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.079> she<00:01:49.200> charges<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.979> 3<00:01:50.159> seconds<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you know she charges for 3 seconds that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
you know she charges for 3 seconds that
didn't<00:01:51.000> shoot<00:01:51.390> sir<00:01:51.659> expo<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.729> mean<00:01:54.030> there's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
didn't shoot sir expo so I mean there's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
didn't shoot sir expo so I mean there's
a<00:01:54.299> few<00:01:54.570> things<00:01:55.290> maybe<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.799> could<00:01:56.040> implement

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
a few things maybe they could implement

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
something and I really like it I really

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.449 
something and I really like it I really
like

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
like

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.059 
like
and<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.840> last<00:02:12.019> thing<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.379> announced<00:02:12.829> was

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
and the last thing they announced was

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.970 
and the last thing they announced was
there<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> level<00:02:14.000> 5<00:02:14.180> free<00:02:14.780> spill<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.620> most

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
there is a level 5 free spill so most

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.300 
there is a level 5 free spill so most
likely<00:02:16.159> that<00:02:16.519> should<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.879> another<00:02:17.090> second<00:02:17.810> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
likely that should get another second of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.160 
likely that should get another second of
freeze<00:02:19.310> time<00:02:19.609> for<00:02:19.939> you<00:02:20.000> guys<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.209> work<00:02:20.689> with<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
freeze time for you guys to work with I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.990 
freeze time for you guys to work with I
didn't<00:02:21.829> really<00:02:22.010> care<00:02:22.310> much<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.849> because

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
didn't really care much for that because

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.459 
didn't really care much for that because
I<00:02:23.209> think<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.510> free<00:02:23.719> spell<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.079> actually

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
I think the free spell is actually

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.699 
I think the free spell is actually
already<00:02:24.650> good<00:02:25.099> as<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.989> but<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.409> if

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
already good as it is but you know if

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.190 
already good as it is but you know if
they<00:02:27.859> do<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> level<00:02:28.280> 5<00:02:28.459> that's<00:02:28.670> fine<00:02:29.139> so<00:02:30.139> you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
they do a level 5 that's fine so you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.470 
they do a level 5 that's fine so you
guys<00:02:30.379> this<00:02:30.409> is<00:02:30.739> all<00:02:30.920> speculation<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:32.120> my<00:02:32.180> part
