we've been I think trying to convey that
is<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.230> low-income<00:02:43.769> countries<00:02:44.099> need

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
is that low-income countries need

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.229 
is that low-income countries need
predictable<00:02:45.709> financing<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.239> predictability

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
predictable financing and predictability

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.750 
predictable financing and predictability
8<00:02:48.810> predictability<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:49.859> important<00:02:50.400> so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
8 predictability is very important so

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
8 predictability is very important so
it's<00:02:50.910> an<00:02:50.970> opportunity<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.810> deepen<00:02:52.739> the
