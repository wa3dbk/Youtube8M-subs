how<00:00:00.390> to<00:00:00.450> draw<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> simple<00:00:01.199> scenery<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
how to draw a simple scenery so this is

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.370 
how to draw a simple scenery so this is
a<00:00:02.700> simple<00:00:03.179> drawing<00:00:03.510> technique<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.350> are

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
a simple drawing technique that we are

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.010 
a simple drawing technique that we are
using<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.580> main<00:00:05.850> part<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.420> drawing<00:00:06.750> is

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
using the main part of this drawing is

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.990 
using the main part of this drawing is
actually<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.620> are<00:00:07.830> covering<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> actual

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
actually we are covering the actual

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320 
actually we are covering the actual
scene<00:00:09.240> Rivia<00:00:09.599> looking<00:00:10.019> inside<00:00:11.030> from<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> house

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
scene Rivia looking inside from a house

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.539 
scene Rivia looking inside from a house
to<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.960> outside<00:00:13.380> world<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.190> means<00:00:14.429> you

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
to the outside world so that means you

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.930 
to the outside world so that means you
can<00:00:14.700> see<00:00:14.969> at<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> wall<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:17.100> pillow<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.640> there

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
can see at the wall the pillow or there

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.420 
can see at the wall the pillow or there
and<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:19.109> lamp<00:00:19.380> which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.800> hanging<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and the lamp which is hanging and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.150 
and the lamp which is hanging and
through<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.900> partition<00:00:22.350> only<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> see

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
through that partition only we can see

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.009 
through that partition only we can see
the<00:00:23.310> scenery<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.910> outside<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.480> that's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the scenery which is outside so that's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
the scenery which is outside so that's
the<00:00:25.230> wall<00:00:25.470> which<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.740> crack<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> old

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the wall which is crack it's the old

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
the wall which is crack it's the old
house<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> plastering<00:00:28.080> has<00:00:28.260> cracked<00:00:28.650> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
house and the plastering has cracked so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980 
house and the plastering has cracked so
you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> brig's<00:00:29.699> inside<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
you can see the brig's inside that's a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
you can see the brig's inside that's a
drawing<00:00:31.230> technique<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.130> ok<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
drawing technique we use ok so we have a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.680 
drawing technique we use ok so we have a
small<00:00:34.020> jug<00:00:34.260> also<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:35.090> two<00:00:36.090> three<00:00:36.300> trees

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
small jug also there two three trees

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
small jug also there two three trees
outside<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> main<00:00:38.040> part<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.550> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
outside so the main part of this is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.619 
outside so the main part of this is
shading<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.840> wall<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:41.040> pillar<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.360> lamp

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
shading the wall the pillar and the lamp

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.440 
shading the wall the pillar and the lamp
and<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> small<00:00:44.520> jar<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.690> we'll<00:00:45.989> be

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
and the small jar all that so we'll be

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.729 
and the small jar all that so we'll be
expecially<00:00:48.450> looking<00:00:48.780> into<00:00:49.050> drawing

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
expecially looking into drawing

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
expecially looking into drawing
techniques<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.180> simple

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
techniques in this it's a very simple

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
techniques in this it's a very simple
drawing<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.170> try<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> improve

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
drawing which you can try to improve

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.119 
drawing which you can try to improve
your<00:00:53.309> pencil<00:00:54.030> drawing<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> shading

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
your pencil drawing and shading

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
your pencil drawing and shading
capabilities<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.309> try<00:00:56.670> shading<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
capabilities you can try shading it and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
capabilities you can try shading it and
learn<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.379> were<00:00:58.620> shading<00:00:59.059> capabilities

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
learn how we were shading capabilities

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
learn how we were shading capabilities
and<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.660> improve<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.590> shading

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and how you can improve the shading

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
and how you can improve the shading
techniques<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.480> uploading<00:01:03.899> more

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
upload it for you so we are darkening up
the<00:01:23.220> drawing<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.360> darkening

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the drawing you can see we are darkening

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.570 
the drawing you can see we are darkening
up<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> pillar<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.340> specific

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
up the pillar to make it more specific

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
up the pillar to make it more specific
you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> beauty<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> pillar

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you can see the beauty of the pillar

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
you can see the beauty of the pillar
when<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> shading<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.950> over<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
when the shading is over there and the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
when the shading is over there and the
cracks<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.159> part<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> drawing

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
cracks are also a part of the drawing

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
cracks are also a part of the drawing
techniques<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.670> simple<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
techniques it's it's a simple way to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.870 
techniques it's it's a simple way to
convey<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.990> others<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.670> look<00:01:38.670> into

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
convey to others that how we look into

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
convey to others that how we look into
the<00:01:38.970> detail<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> drawing<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.380> shows

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the detail of a drawing so that shows

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
the detail of a drawing so that shows
the<00:01:40.770> detailing<00:01:41.100> part<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.899> this<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the detailing part of it and this is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
the detailing part of it and this is
light<00:01:43.290> shading<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.399> doing<00:01:45.030> right

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
light shading that we are doing right

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.780 
light shading that we are doing right
now<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.049> charcoal<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.920> dark

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
now you can use charcoal for dark

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
now you can use charcoal for dark
shading<00:01:48.149> also<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.920> shown<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
shading also so that will be shown in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.050 
shading also so that will be shown in
the<00:01:50.729> later<00:01:50.909> stage<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> learn<00:01:53.060> shading

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the later stage when you learn shading

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.639 
the later stage when you learn shading
techniques<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.259> level

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
techniques at your level

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.700 
techniques at your level
so<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:57.090> Sailor<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.450> getting<00:01:57.810> almost<00:01:57.960> finished

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so the Sailor is getting almost finished

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.980 
so the Sailor is getting almost finished
all<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> them<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.729> actually<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
all of them so we actually that's the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679 
all of them so we actually that's the
Sun<00:02:01.259> over<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.040> we'll<00:02:02.270> put<00:02:03.270> some<00:02:03.299> birds
