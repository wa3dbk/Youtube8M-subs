00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
headphones and USB mouse and just then

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.540 
headphones and USB mouse and just then
notebook<00:00:56.620> keyboard

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.390 

yeah<00:01:04.620> someone<00:01:07.080> okay<00:01:08.080> let's<00:01:08.680> keep<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.190> open

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
yeah someone okay let's keep that open

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.300 
yeah someone okay let's keep that open
and<00:01:10.050> let's<00:01:11.050> try<00:01:11.229> something<00:01:11.830> more<00:01:12.040> interesting

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
and let's try something more interesting

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.340 
and let's try something more interesting
like<00:01:12.840> software<00:01:13.840> like<00:01:14.110> fireworks<00:01:14.979> cs5<00:01:19.350> which

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
like software like fireworks cs5 which

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.890 
like software like fireworks cs5 which
is<00:01:20.650> maybe<00:01:20.920> something<00:01:21.729> more<00:01:21.970> interesting<00:01:22.240> that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
is maybe something more interesting that

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.080 
is maybe something more interesting that
games<00:01:23.290> because<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.409> already<00:01:26.710> know<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.520> this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
games because we already know that this

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.490 
games because we already know that this
machine<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.720> not<00:01:28.900> related<00:01:29.409> gaming<00:01:30.159> but<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:32.170> can

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
machine is not related gaming but we can

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.150 
machine is not related gaming but we can
of<00:01:32.740> course<00:01:33.130> use<00:01:33.250> software<00:01:34.800> let's<00:01:35.800> see<00:01:36.009> how

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
of course use software let's see how

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.770 
of course use software let's see how
does<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.580> work<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.160> loading<00:01:42.780> 20

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
does it work it's like loading 20

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:53.460 
does it work it's like loading 20
seconds<00:01:45.539> yes<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.850> faster<00:01:52.479> loadings<00:01:53.050> so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
seconds yes I so faster loadings so

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.690 
seconds yes I so faster loadings so
maybe<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.250> not<00:01:54.660> this<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.720> just<00:01:56.050> cold<00:01:57.009> load

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
maybe this is not this is just cold load

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.760 
maybe this is not this is just cold load
from<00:02:00.119> first<00:02:01.119> load

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.880 

I<00:02:06.299> show<00:02:07.299> you<00:02:07.359> the<00:02:07.420> system<00:02:07.929> monitor<00:02:08.410> which

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
I show you the system monitor which

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.839 
I show you the system monitor which
shows<00:02:11.970> yeah<00:02:12.970> skype<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:14.080> draining<00:02:14.849> fifty

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
shows yeah skype is just draining fifty

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.750 
shows yeah skype is just draining fifty
percent<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:16.629> cpu<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.560> guess<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.280> that's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
percent of my cpu so I guess this that's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.160 
percent of my cpu so I guess this that's
something<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.599> don't<00:02:20.290> want<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:22.330> I'm<00:02:22.959> gonna

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
something I don't want okay I'm gonna

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.610 
something I don't want okay I'm gonna
I'm<00:02:23.500> gonna<00:02:23.620> close<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.450> some<00:02:25.450> reasons<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.440> got

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I'm gonna close it some reasons you got

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.900 
I'm gonna close it some reasons you got
stuck<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:28.360> why<00:02:28.980> fireworks<00:02:29.980> took<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:30.730> long

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
stuck that's why fireworks took so long

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.890 
stuck that's why fireworks took so long
to<00:02:31.150> open<00:02:32.069> let's<00:02:33.069> try<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> new<00:02:33.720> file<00:02:36.690> let's<00:02:37.690> write

installed an MD like monitor which shows

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.290 
installed an MD like monitor which shows
the<00:03:38.950> system<00:03:39.550> monitor<00:03:40.140> here<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:43.030> shows

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
the system monitor here it is it shows

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.340 
the system monitor here it is it shows
the<00:03:43.480> GPU<00:03:43.960> usage<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:44.830> cpu<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.330> also<00:03:47.050> how

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
the GPU usage and the cpu and also how

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.470 
the GPU usage and the cpu and also how
you're<00:03:47.710> gonna<00:03:47.950> use<00:03:48.520> your<00:03:48.850> ram<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:55.150> still

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
you're gonna use your ram this still

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:05.130 
you're gonna use your ram this still
open<00:03:55.960> line<00:04:01.230> okay<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.380> loading<00:04:02.740> okay<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.720> can

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
open line okay is loading okay I you can

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
open line okay is loading okay I you can
see<00:04:05.490> maybe<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:07.120> don't<00:04:07.360> but<00:04:08.820> 27<00:04:09.820> CPU<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.690> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
see maybe you don't but 27 CPU and the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.850 
see maybe you don't but 27 CPU and the
GPU<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.190> doing<00:04:12.520> nothing<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.209> if<00:04:13.450> I'm<00:04:13.720> using<00:04:14.230> CS

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
GPU is doing nothing so if I'm using CS

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.700 
GPU is doing nothing so if I'm using CS
5<00:04:15.160> i'm<00:04:15.580> gonna<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:18.640> kind<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.239> suffering<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.870> lot

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.500 

i'm<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:23.980> move<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.460> around<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
i'm going to move this around and the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.800 
i'm going to move this around and the
GPU<00:04:26.080> starts<00:04:26.650> moving<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.880> eight<00:04:28.150> percent

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
GPU starts moving but just eight percent

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.720 
GPU starts moving but just eight percent
which<00:04:29.230> is<00:04:29.500> not<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:30.250> much<00:04:32.280> let's<00:04:33.280> just<00:04:33.490> take

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
which is not that much let's just take

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.360 
which is not that much let's just take
this<00:04:33.760> on<00:04:34.330> top<00:04:37.020> that's<00:04:38.020> eventually<00:04:38.740> open

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
this on top that's eventually open

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.420 
this on top that's eventually open
Chrome<00:04:40.320> let's<00:04:41.320> find<00:04:41.590> an<00:04:41.770> image<00:04:42.010> like

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.700 

something<00:04:45.430> common<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.590> dog<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:49.240> let's<00:04:49.810> take<00:04:50.140> a

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
something common a dog and let's take a

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.150 
something common a dog and let's take a
big<00:04:51.490> image<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:52.720> 20<00:04:53.590> megapixel<00:04:55.320> yes<00:04:56.320> this

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
big image like 20 megapixel yes this

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:06.590 
big image like 20 megapixel yes this
sounds<00:04:57.610> like<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.820> dog

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.399 

ok

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
ok

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.890 
ok
I<00:05:09.499> save<00:05:10.339> it

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:24.909 

then<00:05:16.540> let's<00:05:17.540> try<00:05:21.100> dragging<00:05:22.100> it<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:24.889> a

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
then let's try dragging it this is a

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.180 
then let's try dragging it this is a
really<00:05:25.280> big<00:05:25.430> image<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:27.740> going<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:28.070> use<00:05:28.160> a

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
really big image so it's going to use a

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.540 
really big image so it's going to use a
lot<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.430> memory<00:05:29.389> I<00:05:29.660> suppose<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:31.280> this

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
lot of memory I suppose but this

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.150 
lot of memory I suppose but this
software<00:05:32.000> is<00:05:32.300> not<00:05:32.419> really<00:05:33.020> using<00:05:33.229> GPU<00:05:33.770> as<00:05:34.009> we

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
software is not really using GPU as we

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.570 
software is not really using GPU as we
can<00:05:34.370> see<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:36.080> image<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.440> really<00:05:36.710> big<00:05:36.919> anything

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
can see the image is really big anything

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.240 
can see the image is really big anything
if<00:05:37.789> i<00:05:38.000> drag<00:05:38.330> it<00:05:38.570> around<00:05:38.990> it's<00:05:39.949> not<00:05:40.100> really

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
if i drag it around it's not really

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.360 
if i drag it around it's not really
using<00:05:40.550> GPU<00:05:40.970> at<00:05:41.060> all<00:05:41.210> because<00:05:41.960> we<00:05:42.229> have<00:05:42.410> three

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
using GPU at all because we have three

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.240 
using GPU at all because we have three
percent<00:05:43.880> nine<00:05:44.419> percent<00:05:45.020> ten<00:05:45.440> percent<00:05:45.919> yes

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
percent nine percent ten percent yes

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.060 
percent nine percent ten percent yes
something<00:05:46.789> maybe<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:47.680> it's<00:05:48.680> not<00:05:48.889> really

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
something maybe but it's not really

00:05:49.070 --> 00:06:00.040 
something maybe but it's not really
using<00:05:49.340> GPU<00:05:56.229> ok<00:05:57.699> so<00:05:58.699> the<00:05:59.300> image<00:05:59.539> is<00:05:59.660> not<00:05:59.840> really

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
using GPU ok so the image is not really

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.180 
using GPU ok so the image is not really
scrolling<00:06:00.530> smoothly<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:02.080> at<00:06:03.080> least<00:06:03.320> the<00:06:03.770> CPU

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
scrolling smoothly so at least the CPU

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.180 
scrolling smoothly so at least the CPU
is<00:06:04.370> eighty<00:06:04.729> ninety<00:06:05.360> percent<00:06:05.830> system<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:06.979> like

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
is eighty ninety percent system is like

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.600 
is eighty ninety percent system is like
you<00:06:08.120> know<00:06:08.240> kind<00:06:08.660> of<00:06:08.830> trouble<00:06:09.830> now<00:06:10.840> can<00:06:11.840> copy

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
you know kind of trouble now can copy

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:25.779 
you know kind of trouble now can copy
cut<00:06:17.020> some<00:06:18.020> parts<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.680> here<00:06:19.610> we<00:06:19.729> have<00:06:19.760> it

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.029 

yes<00:06:26.789> it<00:06:27.150> does<00:06:27.449> work<00:06:27.780> but<00:06:28.289> it's<00:06:28.499> not<00:06:28.770> this

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
yes it does work but it's not this

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.909 
yes it does work but it's not this
modest<00:06:29.629> experience<00:06:30.629> II<00:06:30.780> could<00:06:31.110> have<00:06:31.319> from

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
modest experience II could have from

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.700 
modest experience II could have from
this<00:06:32.159> sulfur<00:06:32.789> so<00:06:33.060> maybe<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:34.319> would<00:06:34.469> not<00:06:34.650> like

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
this sulfur so maybe you would not like

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.739 
this sulfur so maybe you would not like
to<00:06:35.009> use<00:06:35.430> it<00:06:35.639> for<00:06:36.080> too<00:06:37.080> much<00:06:37.319> video<00:06:37.620> editing<00:06:38.279> or

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
to use it for too much video editing or

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.879 
to use it for too much video editing or
just<00:06:39.749> image<00:06:40.169> editing<00:06:40.650> or<00:06:41.599> processing<00:06:42.599> as<00:06:42.889> we

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
just image editing or processing as we

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.489 
just image editing or processing as we
all<00:06:44.099> know<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.879> CPU<00:06:45.360> is<00:06:45.509> not<00:06:45.749> really<00:06:46.020> powerful

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
all know the CPU is not really powerful

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:49.730 
all know the CPU is not really powerful
so<00:06:46.879> if<00:06:47.879> the<00:06:48.210> software<00:06:48.449> is<00:06:48.689> not<00:06:48.779> really<00:06:49.199> using

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
so if the software is not really using

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.269 
so if the software is not really using
the<00:06:50.189> GPU<00:06:50.729> power<00:06:51.150> I<00:06:51.629> would<00:06:52.199> not<00:06:52.439> recommend<00:06:52.680> to

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:53.279 
the GPU power I would not recommend to

00:06:53.279 --> 00:07:05.019 
the GPU power I would not recommend to
use<00:06:53.460> it<00:07:00.080> let's<00:07:01.080> try<00:07:01.259> opening<00:07:01.529> adobe<00:07:02.340> reader

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:05.029 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.839 

free<00:07:06.029> a<00:07:06.360> cold<00:07:06.779> start<00:07:07.199> and<00:07:07.500> it's<00:07:08.490> kind<00:07:08.729> of

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
free a cold start and it's kind of

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.920 
free a cold start and it's kind of
instant<00:07:09.419> a<00:07:09.719> strike<00:07:10.379> and<00:07:10.650> fireworks<00:07:11.930> second

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
instant a strike and fireworks second

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.490 
instant a strike and fireworks second
start<00:07:13.639> it<00:07:14.639> should<00:07:15.060> go<00:07:15.389> really<00:07:15.930> faster<00:07:16.349> than

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
start it should go really faster than

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.480 
start it should go really faster than
before<00:07:16.710> because<00:07:17.189> we<00:07:17.729> have<00:07:17.960> skype<00:07:18.960> blocked<00:07:19.490> yes

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
before because we have skype blocked yes

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.089 
before because we have skype blocked yes
and<00:07:20.789> it's<00:07:20.939> already<00:07:21.449> open<00:07:21.599> so<00:07:22.199> it's<00:07:22.860> kind<00:07:23.039> of

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 
and it's already open so it's kind of

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.950 
and it's already open so it's kind of
quick<00:07:23.339> it's<00:07:24.029> not<00:07:24.270> a<00:07:24.539> slow<00:07:26.180> slow<00:07:27.180> performances

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
quick it's not a slow slow performances

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.450 
quick it's not a slow slow performances
but<00:07:28.610> when<00:07:29.610> it<00:07:29.729> comes<00:07:30.029> to<00:07:30.449> calculate<00:07:31.020> something

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 
but when it comes to calculate something

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.649 
but when it comes to calculate something
it's<00:07:32.460> really<00:07:33.120> a<00:07:33.150> pain<00:07:33.449> yeah<00:07:34.020> so<00:07:34.469> just<00:07:35.120> I<00:07:36.120> won't

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659 
it's really a pain yeah so just I won't

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.800 
it's really a pain yeah so just I won't
let<00:07:36.750> you<00:07:36.960> know<00:07:37.080> that<00:07:37.969> you<00:07:38.969> have<00:07:39.000> tried<00:07:39.509> a<00:07:39.539> lot

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
let you know that you have tried a lot

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.629 
let you know that you have tried a lot
of<00:07:39.960> things<00:07:40.169> even<00:07:40.560> winrar<00:07:41.370> and<00:07:43.339> this<00:07:44.339> is<00:07:44.460> not

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 
of things even winrar and this is not

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:51.279 
of things even winrar and this is not
pleasant

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:51.289 

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:54.820 

yeah<00:07:52.159> I<00:07:52.509> would<00:07:53.509> say<00:07:53.779> it's<00:07:54.139> enough<00:07:54.469> for<00:07:54.499> now

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
yeah I would say it's enough for now

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.969 
yeah I would say it's enough for now
thank<00:07:55.520> you<00:07:55.639> for<00:07:55.759> watching
