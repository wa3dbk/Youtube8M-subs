back tying the game up at one and that's
how<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> ends<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.770> another

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
how it ends so there will be another

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
how it ends so there will be another
match<00:00:47.460> between<00:00:47.730> Man<00:00:48.149> City<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> Man<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.170> to

see who's gonna advance in the Capital

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.880 
see who's gonna advance in the Capital
One<00:00:51.449> Cup<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> might<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
One Cup now I think that might be the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
One Cup now I think that might be the
semi-finals<00:00:53.760> did<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> say<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:54.960> anybody<00:00:55.140> catch

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
semi-finals did it say did anybody catch

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
semi-finals did it say did anybody catch
it<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.070> might<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.340> been<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> semi-final

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it that might have been the semi-final

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.250 
it that might have been the semi-final
so<00:00:57.239> maybe<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> game<00:00:57.870> before<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so maybe that's the game before the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340 
so maybe that's the game before the
semi-finals<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.789> sure<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.350> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
semi-finals I'm not really sure but we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.569 
semi-finals I'm not really sure but we
have<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> chance<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> advancing<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
have a chance in advancing in the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609
