know if they fade in the Sun I'll give
another<00:01:16.229> code<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
another code but I think I like it as it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.050 
another code but I think I like it as it
is<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:22.549> painted<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> wheels

cattail foundry at Lancaster
Pennsylvania<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:35.780> i<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> grease<00:01:37.680> fitting

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
Pennsylvania I i put the grease fitting

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.260 
Pennsylvania I i put the grease fitting
in<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.759> come<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:38.970> grease

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in there they don't come with grease

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.010 
in there they don't come with grease
fittings<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:42.030> figured<00:01:42.450> since

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
fittings in them but figured since

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.580 
fittings in them but figured since
this<00:01:44.829> thing<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.130> probably<00:01:45.219> going<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.549> weigh

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this thing is probably going to weigh

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.919 
this thing is probably going to weigh
close<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.679> fifth<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.850> know<00:01:48.969> 1,200<00:01:49.600> pounds

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
close to fifth you know 1,200 pounds

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
going to show you what i did for the

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.819 
going to show you what i did for the
axle<00:02:28.630> here<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.840> haven't<00:02:29.110> sitting<00:02:29.319> up<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.560> blocks

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
axle here I haven't sitting up on blocks

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.380 
axle here I haven't sitting up on blocks
just<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.670> been<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.970> wheels<00:02:31.150> while<00:02:31.329> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
just so it's been the wheels while I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.640 
just so it's been the wheels while I
patted<00:02:31.780> them<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.760> what<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.910> did<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.390> axle<00:02:34.840> for

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
patted them but what I did the axle for

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.770 
patted them but what I did the axle for
the<00:02:35.739> most<00:02:35.950> part<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:37.260> 2<00:02:38.260> by<00:02:38.440> 2<00:02:38.470> square<00:02:39.040> tubing

they're<00:03:05.350> pretty<00:03:05.470> well<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.920> there<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:07.600> to

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
they're pretty well in there so not to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.690 
they're pretty well in there so not to
worry<00:03:07.750> about<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.230> at<00:03:08.410> all

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.510 

I<00:03:11.900> chose<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> square<00:03:13.379> tubing<00:03:13.830> over<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.459> one

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
I chose the square tubing over just one

thing<00:03:28.440> pretty<00:03:28.560> much<00:03:32.120> had<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> countersink<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
thing pretty much had to countersink the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180 
thing pretty much had to countersink the
through<00:03:35.400> bolts<00:03:35.760> there<00:03:36.030> for<00:03:36.780> clearance<00:03:37.190> when

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
through bolts there for clearance when

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.550 
through bolts there for clearance when
you<00:03:38.280> turn<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.730> axle

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.020 

the<00:03:45.450> bearing<00:03:46.450> plate<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.930> essentially<00:03:47.590> that

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the bearing plate is essentially that

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550 
the bearing plate is essentially that
this<00:03:49.030> round<00:03:49.330> disk<00:03:49.599> right<00:03:49.810> inside<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.230> here

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
this round disk right inside of here

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.820 
this round disk right inside of here
about<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> quarter-inch<00:03:51.730> thick<00:03:52.380> four<00:03:53.380> inches

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
about a quarter-inch thick four inches

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.330 
about a quarter-inch thick four inches
four<00:03:54.400> inches<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:54.700> diameter<00:03:56.040> that's<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.310> a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
four inches in diameter that's like a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.400 
four inches in diameter that's like a
big<00:03:57.550> washer<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:58.330> uh<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:59.020> take<00:03:59.200> some<00:03:59.380> of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
big washer just uh just to take some of

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.620 
big washer just uh just to take some of
the<00:03:59.530> load<00:03:59.560> let<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.640> slide<00:04:00.790> around<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.480> little

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
the load let it slide around a little

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.800 
the load let it slide around a little
bit<00:04:01.750> easier<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.640> center<00:04:03.910> pin<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.300> piece

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
bit easier and the center pin is a piece

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.449 
bit easier and the center pin is a piece
of<00:04:04.840> one<00:04:05.080> inch<00:04:05.230> round<00:04:05.470> stock<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> if<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.340> know

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
of one inch round stock so if you know

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.240 
of one inch round stock so if you know
the<00:04:10.450> rigidity<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> wasn't<00:04:11.890> such<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> big

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
the rigidity is it wasn't such a big

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.850 
the rigidity is it wasn't such a big
concern<00:04:12.519> up<00:04:12.760> at<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.000> back<00:04:13.150> axle<00:04:13.420> because<00:04:13.959> you

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
concern up at the back axle because you

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.349 
concern up at the back axle because you
know<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.099> supported<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:15.760> close<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.209> edge

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
know it's supported so close to the edge

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.840 
know it's supported so close to the edge
but<00:04:17.290> with<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.500> front<00:04:17.739> axle<00:04:17.889> being<00:04:18.669> only

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
but with the front axle being only

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.219 
but with the front axle being only
support<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.389> center<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:19.750> didn't<00:04:19.959> want<00:04:20.079> any

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
support in the center I didn't want any

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.620 
support in the center I didn't want any
flex<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:20.919> water<00:04:21.820> pipe<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.330> that's<00:04:22.450> why<00:04:22.600> I

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
flex in the water pipe so that's why I

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.670 
flex in the water pipe so that's why I
went<00:04:22.900> with<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.669> 2-inch<00:04:24.669> square<00:04:25.000> there<00:04:28.680> and

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
went with the 2-inch square there and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.170 
went with the 2-inch square there and
for<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:29.979> front<00:04:30.160> handle<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.760> made<00:04:30.940> this

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
for the front handle I just made this

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.590 
for the front handle I just made this
set<00:04:31.479> up<00:04:31.950> as<00:04:32.950> someone<00:04:33.310> x<00:04:33.610> 1<00:04:33.850> square<00:04:34.030> tubing

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
set up as someone x 1 square tubing

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.010 
set up as someone x 1 square tubing
little<00:04:35.139> pieces<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.470> plate<00:04:36.630> or<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.870> piece

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
little pieces of plate or just a piece

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.830 
little pieces of plate or just a piece
around<00:04:38.260> stock<00:04:38.650> there<00:04:39.600> for<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.690> handle

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.629 

you<00:04:44.380> can't<00:04:44.590> turn<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.889> all<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.010> way<00:04:45.100> because<00:04:45.490> of

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
you can't turn it all the way because of

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.689 
you can't turn it all the way because of
the<00:04:45.730> blocks<00:04:45.970> will<00:04:46.210> during<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.510> way<00:04:47.610> but<00:04:48.610> it

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
the blocks will during the way but it

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.740 
the blocks will during the way but it
spins<00:04:48.940> easily<00:04:50.699> and<00:04:51.699> I've<00:04:51.790> got<00:04:52.000> this<00:04:52.330> plate<00:04:52.600> on

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
spins easily and I've got this plate on

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.460 
spins easily and I've got this plate on
top<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:54.400> lag<00:04:54.669> screw<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.240> that's<00:04:56.020> just<00:04:56.290> so

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
top just lag screw it in that's just so

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.680 
top just lag screw it in that's just so
that<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:57.639> know<00:04:57.669> as<00:04:57.910> you're<00:04:58.120> pushing<00:04:58.389> and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
that you know as you're pushing and

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.040 
that you know as you're pushing and
pulling<00:04:58.900> the<00:05:00.060> pin<00:05:01.060> doesn't<00:05:01.240> wear<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.660> woods

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
pulling the pin doesn't wear the woods

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.600 
pulling the pin doesn't wear the woods
so<00:05:02.260> much<00:05:02.500> it's<00:05:02.770> got<00:05:02.979> something<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> press

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
so much it's got something to press

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.730 
so much it's got something to press
against<00:05:04.030> up<00:05:04.150> here<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.540> little<00:05:05.380> bit<00:05:05.560> extra

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
threads on there so I can be unthread

everywhere<00:06:14.880> just<00:06:15.880> use<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.150> panzer<00:06:16.539> which<00:06:16.960> my

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
everywhere just use the panzer which my
