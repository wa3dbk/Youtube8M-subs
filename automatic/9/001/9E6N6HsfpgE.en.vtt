00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
shiners so what we're imitating we might

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.800 
shiners so what we're imitating we might
not<00:03:21.290> have<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.590> exact<00:03:21.980> color<00:03:22.450> color<00:03:23.450> schemes

works extremely well down here and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.830 
works extremely well down here and
that's<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:54.830> we<00:03:54.920> got<00:03:55.040> our<00:03:55.160> first<00:03:55.310> fish<00:03:55.580> on

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840

another fly that works really well down
here<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.570> kickin<00:04:00.080> chicken<00:04:00.110> which<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:01.520> is

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
here is the kickin chicken which this is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.490 
here is the kickin chicken which this is
a<00:04:01.670> little<00:04:01.850> small<00:04:02.090> for<00:04:02.300> today<00:04:02.600> but<00:04:03.200> you'll<00:04:03.350> see

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
a little small for today but you'll see

weight in the back and that'll make that
flight<00:04:06.770> dart<00:04:07.070> around<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:08.270> were<00:04:08.360> just<00:04:08.510> talking

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
flight dart around we were just talking

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.340 
flight dart around we were just talking
about<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.750> most<00:04:11.840> effective

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
about the one of the most effective

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.270 
about the one of the most effective
smallmouth<00:04:12.770> lures<00:04:13.100> of<00:04:13.250> all<00:04:13.370> time<00:04:13.670> is<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:15.280> jerk

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
smallmouth lures of all time is the jerk

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.880 
smallmouth lures of all time is the jerk
bait<00:04:16.489> okay<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.390> reason<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:17.959> lure

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
bait okay and the reason that that lure

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.340 
bait okay and the reason that that lure
is<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.280> important<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.180> small<00:04:20.540> fishermen<00:04:21.230> is

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
is so important to small fishermen is

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.520 
is so important to small fishermen is
its<00:04:22.100> its<00:04:22.370> action<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.360> lure<00:04:24.320> will

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
its its action so that the lure will

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.950 
its its action so that the lure will
dart<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.010> pause<00:04:25.220> dart<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.060> pause<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.780> that's

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
dart and pause dart and pause and that's

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.909 
dart and pause dart and pause and that's
what<00:04:27.080> we're<00:04:27.200> trying<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.380> imitate<00:04:27.560> with<00:04:27.830> our

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
what we're trying to imitate with our

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.250 
what we're trying to imitate with our
flies<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.940> dart<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.390> pause<00:04:29.570> action<00:04:30.110> and

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
flies is that dart and pause action and

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.810 
flies is that dart and pause action and
most<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.620> time<00:04:30.860> if<00:04:31.220> you're<00:04:31.370> stripping<00:04:31.669> the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
most of the time if you're stripping the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.370 
most of the time if you're stripping the
fly<00:04:31.970> hard<00:04:32.240> enough<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:32.960> don't<00:04:33.080> even<00:04:33.290> really

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
fly hard enough you don't even really

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.690 
fly hard enough you don't even really
have<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.590> set<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.860> hook<00:04:34.040> you're<00:04:34.250> gonna<00:04:34.370> strip

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
have to set the hook you're gonna strip

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.430 
have to set the hook you're gonna strip
the<00:04:34.730> fly<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.300> then<00:04:35.419> it's<00:04:35.690> gonna<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.930> heavy<00:04:36.200> and

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the fly and then it's gonna be heavy and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.070 
the fly and then it's gonna be heavy and
there's<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.770> fish<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.850> these<00:04:38.030> flies<00:04:38.330> wiggle

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
there's the fish so these flies wiggle

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.990 
there's the fish so these flies wiggle
they<00:04:39.710> dart<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.130> pause<00:04:40.280> really<00:04:40.669> well<00:04:40.820> when

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
they dart and pause really well when

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.370 
they dart and pause really well when
they're<00:04:41.150> when<00:04:41.360> they're<00:04:41.390> manipulated<00:04:42.230> in<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
they're when they're manipulated in the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.650 
they're when they're manipulated in the
right<00:04:42.530> way<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.950> that's<00:04:43.910> what<00:04:44.150> works<00:04:44.330> for<00:04:44.450> us

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
right way and that's what works for us

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.730 
right way and that's what works for us
down<00:04:44.840> here<00:04:45.220> eight<00:04:46.220> fish<00:04:46.400> patterns
