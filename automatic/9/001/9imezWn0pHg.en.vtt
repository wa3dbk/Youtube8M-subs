00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.269
 successful coach 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.099
 here in the interview brave with hard 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 06 in impressive manner 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.640
 has ascended 15 wins in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.039
 has achieved success and ascend 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 has managed with a team the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.830
 been reinforced again in winter 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 It was from the one at the beginning on the very 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 The beginning is not necessarily about it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:39.930
 how proud you are to go out 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:41.550
 your team murder we have ours 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 worst offensive two games six 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.770
 points then probably not a goal cashed 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 The're absolutely proud for me to you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.780
 you , I always count on that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.070
 press pursued you always have somehow 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.420
 tried to believe in it or is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.550
 Outwardly should be with your team 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 once awarded that that really still 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
 it is possible that many of us do not have it anymore 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.790
 so seen with him 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.350
 had messed up at the end 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.940
 did not go the way I did 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.230
 but then we have ourselves 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.090
 composed with our sporty 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.160
 Head of Canada and in our first 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.880
 position route we have said 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.220
 what change 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.020
 and i know the market very well in too 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.820
 Berlin and that's why we have 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.790
 also say I want to have the players 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 and they did a great job too 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
 that is so good I would have 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.100
 not thought too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.210
 So , really impressed 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.580
 hate in the winter again right 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 get good people yes how is it 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.880
 possible in winter especially these top people 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.890
 to get the yes actually otherwise 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.360
 are difficult to get in the summer 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.990
 So more with id number in the name too 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.910
 For example, we like to call you 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.369
 We know each other longer from the donor is present 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.920
 it was still and before that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.869
 actually almost a done thing 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.190
 that he absolutely wanted me too 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.110
 to me because he is also at Lichtenberg 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.290
 do not screw 100 percent happy 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.720
 and had to play his position here 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.759
 and so it was also equal to from 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.170
 want to exhibit our solid intent 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.680
 we have to do with a hollow of power 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 front dinger yes and you have me 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.209
 but not happiness that you in 4sc so often 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.510
 has been playing lately and the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.459
 of course then struck immediately 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.650
 I can be completely satisfied with that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.750
 So Mark Tucker also introduce me 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.239
 very much and knows that there are great qualities 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.739
 but you have not only these two 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.480
 player you have many other whom 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.700
 would you want to lift it out then? 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.530
 We'll ever be out of the team 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 have spoken to a mother a lot 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 is clear 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.190
 in my opinion, was the foundation 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.750
 the waste heat the four-chain has only 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.320
 Eight goals conceded in the last 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.620
 play complete round round 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.620
 and the four did that very well 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.190
 in particular, always two also that of 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.190
 six months no football had played 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.930
 So the top league experience is the four 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.090
 with yüksel you also kansas yourself 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.040
 light fields times matschiner in 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.260
 defend right mountain to turk and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.770
 left in the four- chain toll has it 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.240
 had already been the foundation 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.740
 film success here so far only six that 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.660
 first time in the Berlin berlin 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.660
 top class and what can you do 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.090
 expect from herta 06 and more 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 an additional question is Brahmsstraße 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.160
 Of course, the legendary place for 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.310
 the berlin league until we are satisfied with it 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.740
 is there any other consideration 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.840
 First, we want to change in 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.670
 But that's not ours 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.890
 play hand sportmotor 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.050
 we are not happy as well ourselves 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.880
 active or as a trainer or the player 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.560
 to play in the square 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.820
 I hope that it works we want 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.130
 We would like to be in the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.560
 süringstraße game and at least also 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.950
 but once a week they train 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.270
 last decision has the sport office and 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.110
 what are your goals for now? 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.670
 season coming has me already 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.460
 We wanted to talk to you 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.050

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.430

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.640
 the second half wanted to have but 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.440

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640
 now we have him and then we have 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.010

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.730
 with a player with whom we are in 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.170

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.079
