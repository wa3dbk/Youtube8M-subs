00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.860 
score the comments seem to be a lot more
level-headed<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.520> whatever<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.809> not

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
level-headed but whatever I'm not

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
level-headed but whatever I'm not
exactly<00:00:34.320> sure<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:35.010> happened<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.520> but

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
exactly sure what happened there but

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
exactly sure what happened there but
diving<00:00:36.030> into<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> story<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.809> far<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.620> see

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
diving into the story so far I do see

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.160 
diving into the story so far I do see
this<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.579> bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.329> step<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
this as a bit of a step up from that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
this as a bit of a step up from that
last<00:00:40.559> album<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
last album now that's not to say that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
last album now that's not to say that
there<00:00:42.600> aren't<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.110> lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.559> things<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> could

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
there aren't a lot of things that could

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.540 
there aren't a lot of things that could
be<00:00:44.190> improved<00:00:44.550> upon<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.899> put<00:00:46.410> pop<00:00:46.860> punk<00:00:47.250> in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
be improved upon now I put pop punk in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
be improved upon now I put pop punk in
quotation<00:00:48.210> marks<00:00:48.239> mainly<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.620> don't

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
quotation marks mainly because I don't

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.060

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
feel so contrived and from a place that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.600 
feel so contrived and from a place that
I've<00:01:48.390> heard<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.140> many<00:01:49.290> times<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
times and I was a having a hard time

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.190 
times and I was a having a hard time
differentiating<00:01:56.549> tracks<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.479> looking<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
differentiating tracks and looking at a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
differentiating tracks and looking at a
title<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.740> being<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.100> oh<00:01:59.219> yeah<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.759> one

title when being like oh yeah this one

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880 
title when being like oh yeah this one
goes<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.320> usually<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
goes like that I can usually do that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.080 
goes like that I can usually do that
after<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> maybe<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:02.939> three

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
after like maybe like two or three

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
after like maybe like two or three
lessons<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.750> an<00:02:03.869> album<00:02:04.079> even<00:02:04.619> with<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that there were ones that jumped out to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.170 
that there were ones that jumped out to
me<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> story<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.580> far<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
really takes me maybe like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.349 
really takes me maybe like
seconds<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.219> actually<00:02:14.549> getting<00:02:14.819> into<00:02:14.939> a<00:02:15.030> track

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
seconds of actually getting into a track

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.929 
seconds of actually getting into a track

this one let's tackle a few positive
things<00:02:20.069> about<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.459> record<00:02:20.670> things<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.209> I

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
things about this record things that I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.910 
things about this record things that I
liked<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.930> already<00:02:22.170> mentioned<00:02:22.530> liking<00:02:22.829> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
liked I already mentioned liking the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.770 
liked I already mentioned liking the
track<00:02:23.159> heavy<00:02:23.609> gloom<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.359> because<00:02:24.599> all

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
track heavy gloom just because all

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.509 
track heavy gloom just because all
around<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.379> seems<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> very<00:02:25.859> well-crafted

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
around it seems like a very well-crafted

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.819 
around it seems like a very well-crafted
track<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.840> course<00:02:28.049> solo<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
track and of course solo the

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.170 
track and of course solo the
instrumental<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.549> one<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.909> absolutely

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
instrumental on that one was absolutely

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.839 
instrumental on that one was absolutely
fantastic<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.530> thought<00:02:31.980> there's<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.519> couple<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.280 
fantastic I thought there's a couple of
other<00:02:33.000> tracks<00:02:33.359> that<00:02:33.540> I'm<00:02:33.659> really<00:02:33.840> diggin<00:02:34.170> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290

he's saying he actually comes across
angsty<00:02:55.680> rather<00:02:55.950> than<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.489> forceful<00:02:57.150> nerve

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
angsty rather than just forceful nerve

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.360 
angsty rather than just forceful nerve
comes<00:02:57.930> directly<00:02:58.260> after<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.980> I'm<00:02:59.040> kind

this band but that track in particular
it's<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.849> lot<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.090> fun<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.569> some<00:03:24.900> ways<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.290> I

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
it's a lot of fun in some ways and I

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.750 
it's a lot of fun in some ways and I
feel<00:03:25.349> like<00:03:25.650> yeah<00:03:25.919> okay<00:03:26.280> they<00:03:26.489> could<00:03:26.669> have

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
connected they had the idea there but

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.589 
connected they had the idea there but
then<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.069> kind<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.609> crumbles<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.359> some

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599
