00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.650
 hello to all and with that of tess 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.049
 mobile.fr and in this video I will 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.559
 just show you the differences 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.629
 design majors between left the z3 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 and on the right the z2 we will not talk about 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.890
 spec we'll just talk about design maybe 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.890
 ergonomics but in the end both are 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.269
 pretty close enough 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 so we have two devices they do 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 even very small dimensions 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.850
 similar this is at the level of the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 height the width the z3 and a little bit 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 less wide as you can see 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.940
 that's what's always good 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 thing when we move in this direction there 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.219
 me it always makes me very happy and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 we go zoom shot and a small hold and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.539
 dwell on the differences in design 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 So on top there is not much 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.070
 thing that changes the audio output there she 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 was integrated into a kind of bar here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.109
 there she is more classic there on the bottom 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 we have there it must be the entry for 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.899
 the microphone unless it's high 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.769
 I wonder speaker not expecting the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 speaker is on the side 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.260
 so here we have it here while there 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 it was integrated further down than you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.850
 maybe you can not see that we're going 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 pass on the slices where we see 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.800
 really the same spirit but with this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 roundness bat distinction 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.380
 finally so we got it started 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.730
 to get close to the curve but 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.760
 not really there we are completely 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.700
 in a game put aside it's not 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.490
 easy to show you yeah well that's okay 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.050
 to be hard but that's it and if not there then we 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 can put a micro sd there we can 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.020
 put a microsd the asim I think that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.580
 there we could put the top I 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.720
 remember maybe more than the asim and of 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.780
 the other side also to maybe a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 little difference at this level the touch 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.910
 1 to 0 and unlock an egg 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.620
 finally power of course volume keys of 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.630
 volume of the z3 is a bit longer 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.720
 and there we have the touch of cameras 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.020
 which looks better I find on the z3 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.060
 below we have nothing on the z3 there by 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.810
 against on the z2 we had precisely the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.570
 c1 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.799
 there it was the pickups and a little one 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.330
 small location for a strap 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.720
 so that's something that we have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.849
 seems lost on the z2 z3 I know 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.709
 not if it's really a big loss 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.920
 I do not know who he uses 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.840
 there we have the jack and there was a second 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.920
 micro who placed differently on 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.690
 two micro usb terminals 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.340
 on this side there is always a port of 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.959
 loading for the dock for a dock 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.690
 here and and here at what seems to be the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.140
 speaker on the z3 well and at 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140
 the rear 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.610
 here it is here in its copper version 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.630
 so it's not the same delirium 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.920
 but we still have something 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.420
 similar this is this hull 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.060
 this glass back there this one looks 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 a little bit finer and it feels like a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.750
 Quran takes him in hand but if not to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.610
 the back there is not much that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.140
 then changes from an ergonomics point of view 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.390
 really i'm going to zoom out a little bit 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.349
 for you here this one I have 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.730
 always found that it was rather 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.850
 nice to handle the touch 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.380
 lakiss easily accesses the button 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.750
 of cameras ben there we resume 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.850
 really the same mind the same spirit 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.560
 it looks lighter and thinner 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.109
 it's always this is a point 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.090
 extremely positive for me 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.620
 so curvatures also at the level of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.630
 slices may be more pleasant 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.310
 eventually we take it in hand 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.680
 will depend on people I find that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 it's a bit better but this one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.139
 was not unpleasant either 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.560
 on that there is not much that 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.180
 exchange 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 in the end it's really a question of 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.620
 taste I think but in the honestly 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.019
 sony had not really had very very 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.260
 little modified his z 2 compared to is 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.150
 a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.609
 there we have a change a little more 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.840
 radical and it shows now it's 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.519
 clear that we stay in the same spirit 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.709
 is that what's missing 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.209
 originality or on the contrary is it 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.440
 ba bread when it is a good 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.989
 base that works well 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.190
 as much use it tell me what you 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.010
 think about it in the comments that is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.750
 what you like this little z3 here 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 compared to aid in terms of 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.930
 design at least it's not that this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.230
 video you liked and I tell you to the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.230
 next
