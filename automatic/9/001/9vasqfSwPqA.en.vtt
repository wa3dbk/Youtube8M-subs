00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
seems to work first a question of second

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.189 
seems to work first a question of second
pans<00:00:17.910> there's<00:00:18.390> no<00:00:18.630> seconds<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.400> this<00:00:20.400> watch

that outer tiny tiny tiny ring is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.519 
that outer tiny tiny tiny ring is
actually<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> actual<00:00:26.160> minutes<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.960> big

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
actually the actual minutes the big

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
actually the actual minutes the big
squares<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.240> approximate<00:00:31.109> minutes

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
squares are actually approximate minutes

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709 
squares are actually approximate minutes
which<00:00:31.980> move<00:00:32.279> along<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.239> top<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.630> the

which move along just on top of the
actual<00:00:34.020> minutes<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:34.950> easy<00:00:35.130> reading<00:00:35.870> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
actual minutes just for easy reading you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.160 
actual minutes just for easy reading you
know<00:00:36.960> easy<00:00:37.680> reading<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> inside<00:00:39.149> squares<00:00:39.899> are

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
know easy reading the inside squares are

the<00:00:40.290> hours<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> imagine<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.570> drew<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> line

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the hours so imagine if you drew a line

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.200 
the hours so imagine if you drew a line
from<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> middle<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> circle<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
from the middle of the circle out

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
from the middle of the circle out
through<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> holes<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> read

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
through where the holes are you can read

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
through where the holes are you can read
the<00:00:47.550> time<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:48.000> quickly<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:49.110> example<00:00:49.500> what

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the time very quickly for example what

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.840 
the time very quickly for example what
is<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.489> almost<00:00:50.700> eleven-thirty

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
is this it's a it's almost eleven-thirty

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.069 
is this it's a it's almost eleven-thirty
you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.969> once<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> realize<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.930> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you know once you realize that you can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
you know once you realize that you can
read<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.350> almost<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> real<00:00:56.129> watch<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:57.270> an

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
read it almost like a real watch with an

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.640 
read it almost like a real watch with an
analog<00:00:58.050> watch

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
analog watch

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.700

the<00:01:00.430> band's<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.180> double<00:01:01.570> like<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> big

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the band's the double like the big

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.610 
the band's the double like the big
parentheses<00:01:03.340> there<00:01:03.550> means<00:01:03.760> it's<00:01:04.030> am<00:01:04.450> or<00:01:04.480> no<00:01:05.350> I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
parentheses there means it's am or no I

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.250 
parentheses there means it's am or no I
have<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.280> set<00:01:06.490> wrong<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:07.360> should<00:01:07.510> be<00:01:07.600> p.m.<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
have a set wrong that should be p.m. and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.600 
have a set wrong that should be p.m. and
the<00:01:08.500> other<00:01:08.620> side<00:01:08.860> should<00:01:09.070> be<00:01:09.780> am<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.950> that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
the other side should be am so that's

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.220 
the other side should be am so that's
how<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.790> can<00:01:12.850> tell<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.120> when<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:13.990> press

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
will be going off at whatever time that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.280 
will be going off at whatever time that
was

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
was

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.330 
was
very<00:01:44.950> nice<00:01:45.130> i<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:46.240> this<00:01:46.390> watch<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.690> lot<00:01:47.340> again

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
very nice i like this watch a lot again

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.670 
very nice i like this watch a lot again
the<00:01:48.490> only<00:01:48.610> problem<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.330> fact<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:49.750> my

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
the only problem is the fact that my

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.410 
the only problem is the fact that my
wrist<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.070> smaller<00:01:51.340> than<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.000> only

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
wrist is smaller than that and you only

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.370 
wrist is smaller than that and you only
bend<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:53.110> little<00:01:53.350> bit<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:56.020> i<00:01:56.050> don't<00:01:56.290> know<00:01:56.350> i

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
bend a little bit so i don't know i

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.620 
bend a little bit so i don't know i
might<00:01:56.560> look<00:01:56.680> into<00:01:56.860> getting<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.190> new<00:01:57.360> new<00:01:58.360> band

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
might look into getting a new new band

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.880 
might look into getting a new new band
for<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.160> but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
for it but

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.320 
for it but
1<00:02:01.100> /<00:02:01.250> 3<00:02:01.340> time<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
1 / 3 time and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.360 
1 / 3 time and
for<00:02:02.900> money<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.260> spend<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.710> watch<00:02:03.920> band<00:02:04.250> but
