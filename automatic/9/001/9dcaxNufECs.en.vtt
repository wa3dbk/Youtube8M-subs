00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
on the chip board and you'll put that on

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.110 
on the chip board and you'll put that on
top<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.090> Y<00:02:27.360> button<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:28.140> or<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
top of the Y button here or this or the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.949 
top of the Y button here or this or the
stick<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.580> reason<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.330> broken

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
stick then and the reason it's broken

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.440 
stick then and the reason it's broken
is<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:36.180> reason<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.599> broken<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
is that the reason it's broken is that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.089 
is that the reason it's broken is that
the<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.930> I've<00:02:40.200> dropped<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.739> or<00:02:40.890> something

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
the you I've dropped it or something

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.570 
the you I've dropped it or something
that's<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> did<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.480> peg<00:02:42.780> here<00:02:43.580> isn't

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
that's what I did but the peg here isn't

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.400 
that's what I did but the peg here isn't
as<00:02:44.730> long<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.480> long<00:02:45.660> enough<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.019> touch<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
as long is it long enough to touch the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.039 
as long is it long enough to touch the
button<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.819> by<00:02:47.970> putting<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.750> tiny

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
button so just by putting this tiny

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.470 
button so just by putting this tiny
amount<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:50.010> space<00:02:50.310> it'll<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.910> able<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.299> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
amount of space it'll be able to do it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.199 
amount of space it'll be able to do it
nicely<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.650> you'll<00:02:53.549> get<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.940> nice

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
nicely and you'll get that nice

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.559 
nicely and you'll get that nice
satisfactory<00:02:54.989> click<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.150> gonna<00:02:57.360> put

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
satisfactory click so here I'm gonna put

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.160 
satisfactory click so here I'm gonna put
it<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.900> together<00:02:59.209> which<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.450> simple

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
it back together which is really simple

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.530 
it back together which is really simple
like<00:03:01.319> I'm<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.769> surprised<00:03:02.099> that<00:03:02.540> Microsoft

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
like I'm really surprised that Microsoft

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.479 
like I'm really surprised that Microsoft
made<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.319> easy<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.799> take<00:03:04.920> apart<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.340> put

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
made these so easy to take apart and put

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.839 
made these so easy to take apart and put
back<00:03:05.519> together<00:03:06.709> they're<00:03:07.709> remarkably<00:03:08.310> usually

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
back together they're remarkably usually

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.020 
back together they're remarkably usually
right<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.900> um<00:03:10.340> you'll<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.549> want<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.849> put

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
basically all the specs of Eila for
controller<00:03:45.389> which<00:03:46.290> came<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.739> like<00:03:47.010> month

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
controller which came out like month

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.930 
controller which came out like month
good<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:48.209> um<00:03:48.980> it's<00:03:49.980> basically<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.609> the

different<00:04:03.870> than<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.290> regular<00:04:04.500> one<00:04:04.920> because

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
different than the regular one because

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.400 
different than the regular one because
instead<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.910> having<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.299> four<00:04:06.540> dots<00:04:06.810> they

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410

have just a little circle and the main
cool<00:04:11.609> part<00:04:11.970> about<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.359> controller<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:14.069> X

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
cool part about this controller is the X

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.150 
cool part about this controller is the X
button<00:04:14.549> whatever<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.480> turn<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
