00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.889 

the<00:00:02.760> first<00:00:03.000> stage<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.389> smart<00:00:03.659> grid<00:00:03.750> has

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
the first stage of the smart grid has

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.599 
the first stage of the smart grid has
been<00:00:04.050> about<00:00:04.229> plumbing<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:05.220> getting<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
been about plumbing about getting the

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.129 
been about plumbing about getting the
systems<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.120> work<00:00:06.269> together<00:00:06.420> reliably<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:07.139 
systems to work together reliably and

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.140 
systems to work together reliably and
securely<00:00:07.290> what<00:00:08.189> we've<00:00:08.370> done<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
securely what we've done in the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.880 
securely what we've done in the
acquisition<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.690> granite<00:00:10.050> power<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.500> start<00:00:10.770> to

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
acquisition of granite power is start to

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.230 
acquisition of granite power is start to
think<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.400> second<00:00:11.790> stage<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.180> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
think about the second stage of the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.910 
think about the second stage of the
smart<00:00:12.570> grid<00:00:12.690> which<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.470> about<00:00:13.800> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
smart grid which is all about the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.890 
smart grid which is all about the
consumer<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.300> grounded<00:00:15.720> power

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
consumer and so what grounded power

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
consumer and so what grounded power
brings<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> table<00:00:16.769> is<00:00:17.099> a<00:00:17.300> fantastic

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
brings to the table is a fantastic

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.050 
brings to the table is a fantastic
experience<00:00:18.650> related<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:20.009> driving<00:00:20.429> consumer

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
experience related to driving consumer

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.569 
experience related to driving consumer
behavioral<00:00:21.599> programs<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.890> understanding

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
behavioral programs really understanding

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.550 
behavioral programs really understanding
what<00:00:23.699> incentivizes<00:00:24.359> consumers<00:00:25.079> to<00:00:25.199> change

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
what incentivizes consumers to change

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.460 
what incentivizes consumers to change
and<00:00:25.970> bringing<00:00:26.970> sustained<00:00:27.599> change<00:00:28.230> in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and bringing sustained change in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
and bringing sustained change in
behavior<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:29.789> consumers<00:00:31.970> we<00:00:32.970> looked<00:00:33.180> around

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
behavior to consumers we looked around

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
behavior to consumers we looked around
at<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> market<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.949> out<00:00:35.039> there

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
at the market to see what was out there

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
at the market to see what was out there
