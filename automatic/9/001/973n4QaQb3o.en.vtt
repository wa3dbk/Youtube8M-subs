00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.710
 one 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello how are we doing since I have the other 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.100
 la rondalla and have it well 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.630
 practiced in another video we are going to bet 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.790
 this song the force means that 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.189
 it's called my last and this song my 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.019
 last day of the third heaven so that what 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.180
 look for and become familiar with the letter 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.800
 with melody and this will help them 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.270
 so they know what the changes are like 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.060
 because if not then search listen to it 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.390
 and we're going to try to get it out because this one 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.540
 is the complicated thing we are going to sign it if 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.070
 it's easy the strum is down up 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.070
 up down up down down up 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.809
 since I do not have to have the strum 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.559
 so yes, let's make the contribution 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.559
 of rest 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.570
 I would be king 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.330
 i 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.330
 we become less 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.299
 if minor this yes minor put the finger 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.100
 this put it in the second east and the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.710
 second of donuts to do second fret 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.979
 third finger string in the fourth fret 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.800
 fourth string and the fourth finger in the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.570
 third string fourth fret 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.570
 if you listen to us and listen to you 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.770
 at least I want you to know that this one 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.420
 minor this is the true original if 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.800
 minor since they have it and practiced 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 signs of today then we go to do 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.460
 this they put the first of this one what 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.770
 I was here they put it on the first string 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.170
 and the rest leave it the same and try 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 give the ropes the first four 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.550
 down this not because as it is 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.550
 stepping on it they hear it out of tune plus 34 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.520
 we had a blue 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.490
 and then the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.450
 and then king 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.880
 it would be more like yes 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.880
 to me 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.050
 i 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.450
 and they fixed that I did something different this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.890
 is the liter is re re and practice 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.160
 grip 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.160
 They are networks or they come out fast 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.990
 I am 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 down 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:18.269
 and it will always be the same always goes to 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.269
 to be equal would be real 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.220
 when down 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.060
 he came back 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.390
 it would be like it was my 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.990
 Y 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.570
 to the light 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.570
 with everything 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.720
 that's between the verses those are the 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.190
 stanzas 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.190
 now let's move on to the choir he would know 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.190
 Sun 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.380
 ah 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.380
 the biggest and then remedy new and lower 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.600
 and then they do inside 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.080
 once again 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.180
 notice how is the most are the times 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.180
 in each one is one 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 one 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
 you 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.380
 121 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.210
 that's the whole song then I hope 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.160
 to practice it, look how it was decorated 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.720
 come back in the liter that is also what 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.419
 essential of what is characterized the 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
 I'm re re when I say them 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.960
 it is always the same we are anguished 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.060
 it's always the same, just look 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.740
 where the changes 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.169
 that's all I hope you practice there 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.300
 I order them a lot because I would be very 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.449
 well so that you already have everything in this 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.449
 song
