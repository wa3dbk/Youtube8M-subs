00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.080
 and now everything is friends of youtube I am 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.559
 and we return to nothing that jurassic game 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.540
 I already have it, it's ok, as you can see 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.219
 this great sound above because 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 he did not find it to record in the 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.880
 computer achieved from the mobile 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.250
 so then I'll explain a little 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.400
 what is it worth is like me like this profile 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.529
 of vale but you are based on the last 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.320
 movie then it's a bit different 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.779
 ok page is there that we have adn we have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.519
 food together we have money and we have 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.469
 tickets tickets are going to be a lot 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.540
 more abundant in this game is worth there 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.629
 we have the port, I'm recording 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.539
 Above I warn you just in case 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.520
 so then let's go to the parts of what 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.350
 what is the park that comes to you here 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.719
 we have what follows the pool of 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.950
 mosasaur is worth swimming around 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.370
 you see it baixa and turn up the volume 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.970
 and then we have what would be the port 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 of food is worth activating with coins 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.850
 obviously 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.649
 and it gets better every five levels I think 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 that can be improved but that's good 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:14.100
 trucks is worth then there is collected the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.570
 food more things and good here is the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 innovation center it would be like 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.119
 the as the main building if you have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.310
 seen the movie 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.250
 this is the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.930
 the laboratory the round building and the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.580
 hatchery is the one that is next to 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.810
 egg shape 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.080
 so then this is what the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.729
 part of forest to expand and nothing else 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.560
 to see more things 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.320
 this is an introduction vale is a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 video introduction so you can see a 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.560
 little that goes here we have the triceratops 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:55.930
 I'm going to explain to you and they give you one and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.509
 then passing you a battle or with or 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.460
 completing missions you want envelopes 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.289
 prizes and you can touch another 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 triceratops or any other creature 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.610
 and what is this for? 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 evolve you have them when you have a 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.910
 triceratops at level 10 and another 10 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.180
 data at level 10 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.490
 the boards and the evolution is at level 11 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.880
 and so you have to go gathering up 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.410
 upload it to level 40 and good as you see 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.750
 when we click that I have not said 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 when we click on the dinosaur in addition 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.890
 to collect the currency we can get to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 this landscape and see this and I 'm not so 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 realistic, and as you have seen the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 animation of eating well is also 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.220
 quite realistic the game itself is 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.750
 much more realistic than 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.010
 the pair builders obviously for example 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 since we do not have pterosaurs there 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.270
 We have a lot, lots of 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.950
 creatures but an egg we have 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.010
 so many more than me like that to see 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.380
 which many here we have to under a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 auroux gas is worth a good click a classic 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.820
 no but it is quite interesting and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.820
 good 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.830
 the feeding animation as you see 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.260
 it's pretty aggressive set 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.930
 and it is very well done that is the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.080
 animations you see what the dinosaur is 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.780
 it's very well done there are some who do not 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.490
 they still convince but good 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.900
 Pterosaurs are very well done 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.130
 the white one that we have here is pretty 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.770
 well done 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.660
 the natus trophy that is also very 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.110
 well done and how to go the animation is 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 kind like a bird that good as well as 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.730
 It is typical to see in the birds but 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.160
 good as it is not a bird then that's why 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.530
 you do not see me the natus trophy either 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.790
 it's very well done, it's very good 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.069
 fact 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.420
 and good as you can see I have another at level 10 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.040
 well then we have buildings these are 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.030
 security towers here we have to 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.790
 Argentines others 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.480
 awesome voucher is not very good but 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.299
 is that it's amazing it 's very well done 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.040
 it's amazing and good it has the typical 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.720
 animation of a sauropod like that are going to be 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.790
 the animations of Europeans throughout 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.250
 the game either for the argentinosaurus 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.490
 the diplodocus or any creature 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.730
 also for something that has surprised me 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.960
 there are enough amphibians 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.290
 to remove the diplodocus is worth then 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.240
 good here in the wine market we have 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.670
 all dinosaurs there are three types 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.930
 we have the common the first the 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.840
 we have the rare ones like the diplodocus 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.840
 then we have the ultra rare how would it be 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.050
 the stegosaurus does not appear and the 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.259
 hybrids that would be mixing and we have 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.349
 a list we have below and we have everything 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.840
 we have carnivores the herbivores of the 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.529
 amphibian and hybrid saurians that we can 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.770
 choose good that's invest earning 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.710
 battles or winning the battles you 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.930
 they give world over and you can therefore you see 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.009
 there we have amphibians and hybrids and there 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.240
 how is not nice minus rex obviously 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.029
 all good this would be the non-market 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.340
 then we have the buildings and the 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.479
 ornaments vale here would be all buildings 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.389
 and ornaments 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.670
 So, well, that decided to be 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.890
 it would not be the same 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.600
 and in the original game then for another 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.300
 part we have the roads also that 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.160
 when we put on we appear 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.050
 palmeritas on the sides is very good 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.129
 truth one of the roads I liked 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.099
 It's worth it because it's that well done 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.819
 so then well apart from all this 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.439
 well if the battles obviously we have 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.439
 the normal battles around here the 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.919
 missions is worth a little teaching the 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.919
 missions 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.200
 and then I want to talk a little about the 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.060
 battles not in tournaments but battles 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.760
 there are normal battles and then there are 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.790
 promotion battles that are so envelopes are 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.710
 like envelopes of ultra rare letters that you 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.590
 they touch special dinosaurs and so on 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.150
 etc 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.920
 Well then I think that was it 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.860
 that's been all 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.270
 there goes connects turns to 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.590
 disconnect but well I hope that you 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.510
 have liked this introduction video 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.760
 already the next episode would be the episode 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.100
 1 I hope you like the game if it's like that 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.380
 give it a good like and I'll start it up 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.900
 ok and pay attention to a video of 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.670
 information that I have to give you 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.750
 soon it is worth and it is very important 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.750
 that you see it so that nothing 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.680
 God
