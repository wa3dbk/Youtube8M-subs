and<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:43.140> sending<00:02:43.709> power<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.310> through

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
and that's sending power back through

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.490 
and that's sending power back through
its<00:02:44.700> clever<00:02:45.170> alternator<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.830> battery<00:02:47.250> and

its clever alternator to the battery and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.550 
its clever alternator to the battery and
then<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:50.010> gets<00:02:50.250> used<00:02:51.080> when<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> come<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
then that gets used when I come to a

then that gets used when I come to a

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
stop that stop start technology it's all

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.309 
stop that stop start technology it's all
very<00:02:55.980> clever<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.600> well-thought-out<00:02:57.660> we've

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.620 
very clever and well-thought-out we've
also<00:02:58.500> got<00:02:58.890> low<00:02:59.100> friction<00:02:59.370> tires<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.480> that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
also got low friction tires so that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.199 
also got low friction tires so that
means<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.080> less<00:03:01.470> resistance<00:03:02.459> on<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
means you get less resistance on the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.729 
means you get less resistance on the
road<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.810> still<00:03:04.049> get<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> same<00:03:04.380> amount<00:03:04.560> of

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
road you still get the same amount of

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.640 
road you still get the same amount of
grip<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.790> means<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> tires<00:03:06.720> improve

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
grip but it means that the tires improve

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.819 
grip but it means that the tires improve
your<00:03:07.860> mpg<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.790> that's<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:10.049> part<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.530> what

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
your mpg and that's just part of what

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and it's intelligent motion is it's

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.500 
and it's intelligent motion is it's

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
the gears right in front of you so it's

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.920 
the gears right in front of you so it's
always<00:03:31.920> telling<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.609> where<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.480> should<00:03:33.750> be

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
in the gearbox and that way it can

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.110 
in the gearbox and that way it can
maximize<00:03:37.410> your<00:03:37.560> economy<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.670> kinder<00:03:39.060> on
