see me doing here in this video so we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.360 
see me doing here in this video so we
have<00:00:51.750> created<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.230> training<00:00:52.440> program<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> help

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
have created a training program to help

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
have created a training program to help
Jack<00:00:53.640> learn<00:00:53.879> how<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.110> an

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
Jack learn how and when is an

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so here's Jack after a week of training

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
so here's Jack after a week of training
he<00:01:10.439> has<00:01:10.560> learned<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> walk<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.670> news<00:01:11.909> leash

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
method we have trained him that he is

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
method we have trained him that he is
still<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.460> able<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.150> stop<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> smell

still going to be able to stop and smell

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.530 
still going to be able to stop and smell
his<00:01:40.200> surroundings<00:01:40.770> during<00:01:41.189> his<00:01:41.460> walks<00:01:41.759> but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
his surroundings during his walks but

him okay he's still not perfect because

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
him okay he's still not perfect because
we<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.600> retraining<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.290> years<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> habit<00:01:53.310> out

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
we are retraining for years of habit out

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.789 
we are retraining for years of habit out
of<00:01:53.490> him<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.180> week<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.200> alright<00:01:55.500> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
of him in a week but that's alright we
just<00:01:55.979> continue<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> walk<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:56.939> nothing

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
just continue to walk as if nothing

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.100 
just continue to walk as if nothing
happened<00:01:59.240> now<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.540> method<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.079> are

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
happened now the method that we are

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.749 
happened now the method that we are
using<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.619> train<00:02:01.799> him<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> positive

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
using to train him is positive

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
using to train him is positive
reinforcement<00:02:02.939> training<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.320> we're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
reinforcement training so we're

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
reinforcement training so we're
rewarding<00:02:05.070> him<00:02:05.189> every<00:02:05.579> time<00:02:05.729> he<00:02:06.030> does<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
rewarding him every time he does the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
rewarding him every time he does the
behavior<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.960> want<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> case<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.459> want

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
behavior we want in this case we want
