more<00:00:27.260> now<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.130> removed

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
more now as you can see this is removed

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
more now as you can see this is removed
from<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> lawn<00:00:29.820> well<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> rear<00:00:30.689> axle

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
from the lawn well this is the rear axle

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
from the lawn well this is the rear axle
this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> where<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.070> wheels<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.460> normally

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
this is where your wheels would normally

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330 
this is where your wheels would normally
sit<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.300> end<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.469> end<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
sit on this end and on this end this is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
sit on this end and on this end this is
off<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> mount<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.180> lawnmower<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> what

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
off a mount for your lawnmower so what

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.680 
off a mount for your lawnmower so what
happens<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.910> pulley<00:00:39.180> wheel<00:00:39.390> here

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
happens is you have a pulley wheel here

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.270 
happens is you have a pulley wheel here
that's<00:00:39.899> normally<00:00:40.200> got<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> belt<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> runs<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that's normally got a belt the runs to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
that's normally got a belt the runs to
the<00:00:41.399> center<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> lawnmower<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.629> your

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the center of the lawnmower when your

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.049 
the center of the lawnmower when your
lawnmowers<00:00:43.170> turning<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.280> belt<00:00:44.520> turns<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
lawnmowers turning the belt turns and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
lawnmowers turning the belt turns and
this<00:00:45.149> turns<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:46.250> what<00:00:47.250> happens

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this turns all the time what happens

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
this turns all the time what happens
when<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.149> Milan<00:00:48.420> watubi<00:00:48.750> self-propelled

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
when your Milan watubi self-propelled

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
when your Milan watubi self-propelled
after<00:00:49.770> you've<00:00:49.890> started<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.550> when<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> pull

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
after you've started it up when you pull

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
after you've started it up when you pull
the<00:00:51.539> handle<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:52.289> normally<00:00:52.620> spring<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the handle there's normally spring on

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
the handle there's normally spring on
here<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.610> attached<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.149> cable<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here that's attached to a cable it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
here that's attached to a cable it
knocks<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.829> lever<00:00:56.039> across<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> can

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
knocks this lever across and as you can

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
knocks this lever across and as you can
see<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> knocks<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> across<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
see when it knocks it across if you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
see when it knocks it across if you
watch<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> axle<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> back<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.930> starts<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
watch the axle at the back it starts to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.340 
watch the axle at the back it starts to
turn<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:01.890> propels<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.579> wheels<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> that's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
turn which propels the wheels so that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
turn which propels the wheels so that's
basically<00:01:05.070> how<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> worked<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> let<00:01:06.180> go

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
basically how it worked when you let go

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
basically how it worked when you let go
of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> pull<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> across<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.100> spring<00:01:08.369> tension

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of it pull it across the spring tension

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.320 
of it pull it across the spring tension
is<00:01:08.880> gone<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> stops<00:01:09.810> turning<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:11.330> these

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is gone and it stops turning now these

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
is gone and it stops turning now these
units<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:13.280> prone<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.520> failure<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
units are prone to failure there's a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710 
units are prone to failure there's a
very<00:01:15.540> simple<00:01:15.780> reason<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.360> now<00:01:18.360> inside

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
very simple reason for that now inside

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.710 
very simple reason for that now inside
here<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> metal<00:01:20.369> worm<00:01:20.610> gear<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
here we have a metal worm gear which is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
here we have a metal worm gear which is
our<00:01:21.900> cable<00:01:22.320> unfortunately<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.790> rules<00:01:24.030> against

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
our cable unfortunately it rules against

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
our cable unfortunately it rules against
the<00:01:24.570> plastic<00:01:25.020> gear<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.369> course<00:01:26.610> over

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the plastic gear here and of course over

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.179 
the plastic gear here and of course over
time<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.509> metal<00:01:27.840> gear<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:28.829> wear<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
time the metal gear will wear the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
time the metal gear will wear the
plastic<00:01:29.640> gear<00:01:29.880> away<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.200> unfortunately

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
plastic gear away and unfortunately

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
plastic gear away and unfortunately
there's<00:01:31.950> no<00:01:32.100> easy<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> repairing<00:01:33.090> these

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
there's no easy way of repairing these

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
there's no easy way of repairing these
the<00:01:34.409> quickest<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.130> easiest<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the quickest and easiest way is just to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
the quickest and easiest way is just to
replace<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> part<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.710> cheap

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
replace the part which which out cheap

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.789 
replace the part which which out cheap
but<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.329> looking<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.470> case<00:01:40.680> you

but if you're looking here in case you
were<00:01:40.860> thinking<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.280> taking<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.700> lawn<00:01:41.880> mower

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
were thinking of taking a lawn mower

were thinking of taking a lawn mower
apart<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.630> may<00:01:42.810> save<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
apart this may save you some time if you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.649 
apart this may save you some time if you
see<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> work<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> goes<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.479> very

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
see the work that goes on here it's very

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
see the work that goes on here it's very
difficult<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.649> remove<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> shaft

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
difficult to remove this from the shaft

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
difficult to remove this from the shaft
you<00:01:47.850> can't<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.270> slide<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> off<00:01:48.720> there's<00:01:48.960> all

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you can't just slide it off there's all

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.830 
you can't just slide it off there's all
sorts<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> pins<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> are<00:01:51.689> very

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
sorts of pins in here that are very

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.380 
sorts of pins in here that are very
difficult<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.439> remove<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.159> although<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
difficult to remove so although this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
difficult to remove so although this
video<00:01:54.750> won't<00:01:55.439> help<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> repair<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> may

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
video won't help you repair it it may

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.980 
video won't help you repair it it may
save<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.299> time<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> were<00:01:57.840> thinking

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
save you some time if you were thinking

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
save you some time if you were thinking
of<00:01:58.229> taking<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.740> apart<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:00.000> try<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> try<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
of taking it apart and try to try to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480 
of taking it apart and try to try to
remove<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> axle<00:02:01.860> basically<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
remove it from the axle basically and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
remove it from the axle basically and
try<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> fit<00:02:03.390> another<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.110> might<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
try to fit another one this might just

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
try to fit another one this might just
show<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.250> work<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.939> involved

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
show you the work that would be involved

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
show you the work that would be involved
it's<00:02:06.570> probably<00:02:06.869> quicker<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.259> replace<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it's probably quicker to replace it so I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's probably quicker to replace it so I
thought<00:02:08.759> I'd<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.090> video<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.599> try<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
thought I'd do this video to try and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
thought I'd do this video to try and
save<00:02:10.050> anyone<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> time<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.520> opposed<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
save anyone a bit of time as opposed to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
save anyone a bit of time as opposed to
a<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> money

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
a bit of money

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.030 
a bit of money
so<00:02:13.469> when<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> move<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.700> blue<00:02:14.879> lever<00:02:15.120> across

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
so when you move the blue lever across

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.170 
so when you move the blue lever across
it<00:02:17.040> knocks<00:02:17.249> across<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.760> obviously<00:02:18.030> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it knocks across and obviously it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
it knocks across and obviously it
creates<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.599> gear<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.499> turns<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> axle

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
creates the gear it turns the axle

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.739 
creates the gear it turns the axle
that's<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:20.939> happens<00:02:21.269> when<00:02:21.359> you<00:02:21.480> pull<00:02:21.659> the

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:21.749 
that's what happens when you pull the

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.589 
that's what happens when you pull the
blue<00:02:21.930> lever<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.420> what's

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
blue lever so if you think that's what's

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.699 
blue lever so if you think that's what's
happened<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.049> lawnmower

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
happened to your lawnmower

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.229 
happened to your lawnmower
there's<00:02:26.040> an<00:02:26.129> easy<00:02:26.280> way<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.549> tell<00:02:26.909> from<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
there's an easy way to tell from the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
there's an easy way to tell from the
outside<00:02:27.989> normally<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:28.889> it's<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.129> connected

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
outside normally when it's all connected

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.869 
outside normally when it's all connected
back<00:02:29.700> together<00:02:30.469> if<00:02:31.469> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.889> see<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.609> you<00:02:32.760> look

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
back together if you can see if you look

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.550 
back together if you can see if you look
at<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.359> your<00:02:33.450> lawnmower<00:02:33.659> there's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
at the back of your lawnmower there's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.229 
at the back of your lawnmower there's
normally<00:02:34.889> the<00:02:34.980> cable<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.060> then

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
normally the cable in here and then

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.839 
normally the cable in here and then
you've<00:02:36.329> got<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> spring<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.019> loops<00:02:37.260> over

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
you've got the spring that loops over

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.640 
you've got the spring that loops over
now<00:02:38.849> on<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.419> back<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> mount<00:02:40.049> feel<00:02:40.230> llamas

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
now on the back of the mount feel llamas

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.649 
now on the back of the mount feel llamas
if<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.889> look<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.280> back<00:02:41.489> left<00:02:41.760> sometimes

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
if you look in the back left sometimes

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.030 
if you look in the back left sometimes
you<00:02:42.749> have<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> cut<00:02:43.139> a<00:02:43.169> square<00:02:43.319> out<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:43.889> can

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you have to cut a square out so you can

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.949 
you have to cut a square out so you can
see<00:02:44.280> sometimes<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:44.999> box<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.450> pulls<00:02:45.689> out

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
see sometimes it's a box that pulls out

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.569 
see sometimes it's a box that pulls out
but<00:02:46.139> you'll<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.379> able<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.889> this<00:02:47.099> unit

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
but you'll be able to see this unit

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.390 
but you'll be able to see this unit
you'll<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.569> able<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.780> see<00:02:48.930> hopefully<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.889> spring

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you'll be able to see hopefully a spring

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.909 
you'll be able to see hopefully a spring
here<00:02:50.639> and<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.359> cable<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.349> when<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.620> pull<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
here and the cable now when you pull the

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.789 
here and the cable now when you pull the
lever<00:02:52.949> on<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.849> lawnmower<00:02:54.079> if<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.319> don't<00:02:55.590> see

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
lever on your lawnmower if you don't see

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.470 
lever on your lawnmower if you don't see
even<00:02:56.280> though<00:02:56.579> there's<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> lot<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:57.000> tension<00:02:57.239> on

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
even though there's a lot of tension on

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.509 
even though there's a lot of tension on
the<00:02:57.540> spring<00:02:57.659> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.959> don't<00:02:58.349> see<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:59.219> move

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
the spring if you don't see this move

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.429 
the spring if you don't see this move
over<00:02:59.969> at<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.359> even<00:03:00.810> though<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.139> see<00:03:01.169> the

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
over at all even though you can see the

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.399 
over at all even though you can see the
spring<00:03:01.680> tension<00:03:02.129> in<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.489> means<00:03:03.079> nine<00:03:04.079> times

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
spring tension in it means nine times

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.409 
spring tension in it means nine times
out<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.680> ten<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> gears<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.269> gone

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
out of ten that the gears have gone

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.899 
out of ten that the gears have gone
inside<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.109> is<00:03:07.349> basically<00:03:08.219> eating<00:03:08.489> itself

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
inside which is basically eating itself

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.819 
inside which is basically eating itself
alive<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.840> won't<00:03:10.019> move<00:03:10.139> across<00:03:10.439> because

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
alive and it won't move across because

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.280 
alive and it won't move across because
there's<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.129> many<00:03:11.250> bits<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.849> way<00:03:12.230> but<00:03:13.230> if

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
there's so many bits in the way but if

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.369 
there's so many bits in the way but if
you<00:03:13.379> do<00:03:13.590> see<00:03:13.799> move<00:03:14.040> across<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:16.109> doesn't

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
you do see move across and it doesn't

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.009 
you do see move across and it doesn't
work<00:03:16.759> it<00:03:17.759> may<00:03:17.909> be<00:03:17.939> worth<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.389> just<00:03:18.780> having<00:03:18.959> a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
work it may be worth it just having a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.059 
work it may be worth it just having a
quick<00:03:19.169> look<00:03:19.319> in<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.799> just

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
quick look in here and just just

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.619 
quick look in here and just just
checking<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.459> out<00:03:20.609> if<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.909> try<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.209> replace

checking this out if I try to replace
the<00:03:21.810> power<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.739> there<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.979> a<00:03:23.189> lot<00:03:23.669> of<00:03:23.699> times<00:03:24.120> a

simple fix for what happens with these

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.179 
simple fix for what happens with these
self-propelled<00:03:27.299> as<00:03:28.199> I've<00:03:28.379> said<00:03:28.620> there's<00:03:29.099> a

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
self-propelled as I've said there's a

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.949 
self-propelled as I've said there's a
spring<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.639> hooks<00:03:29.819> over<00:03:30.239> here<00:03:30.419> that<00:03:30.629> goes<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
spring that hooks over here that goes to

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.289 
spring that hooks over here that goes to
the<00:03:31.079> cable<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.099> a<00:03:32.129> lot<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.519> people<00:03:32.909> and<00:03:33.030> when

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the cable now a lot of people and when

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.929 
the cable now a lot of people and when
the<00:03:33.449> self-propelled<00:03:33.840> stops<00:03:34.349> working<00:03:34.939> they

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
the self-propelled stops working they

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.610 
the self-propelled stops working they
mess<00:03:36.239> about<00:03:36.359> with<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:36.659> cable<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.229> handle

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
mess about with the cable on the handle

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.619 
mess about with the cable on the handle
and<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.889> becomes<00:03:38.189> source<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:39.509> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
and it becomes source like that the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.619 
and it becomes source like that the
cable<00:03:40.079> becomes<00:03:40.259> slack<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.489> spring<00:03:41.879> slips

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
cable becomes slack and the spring slips

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.499 
cable becomes slack and the spring slips
off<00:03:42.900> cause<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.829> not<00:03:44.549> under<00:03:44.879> tension<00:03:45.269> anymore

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
off cause it's not under tension anymore

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.390 
off cause it's not under tension anymore
and<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.139> slides<00:03:46.379> off<00:03:46.620> over<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.979> end<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.220> here

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and it slides off over the end of here

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.280 
and it slides off over the end of here
so<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.449> see<00:03:48.689> in<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> back<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.199> your

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
so if you can see in the back of your

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.770 
so if you can see in the back of your
lawnmower<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:50.099> may<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:51.120> cuts<00:03:51.419> out<00:03:51.599> if

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
lawnmower you may see this cuts out if

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.629 
lawnmower you may see this cuts out if
you<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.169> there<00:03:52.349> with<00:03:52.500> no<00:03:52.680> spring<00:03:53.099> it's

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
you see it there with no spring it's

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.369 
you see it there with no spring it's
often<00:03:54.030> because<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.419> spring<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.989> your<00:03:55.139> cable

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
often because you spring and your cable

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.689 
often because you spring and your cable
or<00:03:55.769> satellite<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:01.500> people<00:04:01.919> will<00:04:02.250> try<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.549> get

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
or satellite of people will try and get

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.129 
or satellite of people will try and get
in<00:04:02.849> or<00:04:03.090> try<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.329> get<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.509> cable<00:04:03.930> tie<00:04:04.079> or

in or try and get a cable tie or
something<00:04:04.259> like<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:05.069> quite<00:04:05.280> difficult

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
something like that it's quite difficult

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.699 
something like that it's quite difficult
to<00:04:05.759> get<00:04:05.939> in<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.569> they'll<00:04:06.810> try<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.049> hook<00:04:07.349> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
to get in and they'll try and hook the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.069 
to get in and they'll try and hook the
spring<00:04:08.009> back<00:04:08.400> into<00:04:08.609> this<00:04:08.819> groove<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.150> and

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
spring back into this groove here and

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.869 
spring back into this groove here and
it's<00:04:10.229> really<00:04:10.500> difficult<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:11.189> do<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.579> it

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
it's really difficult to do and it

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.369 
it's really difficult to do and it
sounds<00:04:12.180> obvious<00:04:12.269> but<00:04:12.599> I've<00:04:12.900> seen<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.229> done<00:04:13.259> a

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
sounds obvious but I've seen it done a

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.499 
sounds obvious but I've seen it done a
lot<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.650> times<00:04:13.949> people<00:04:14.759> trying<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.269> hockey

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
lot of times people trying to hockey

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.539 
lot of times people trying to hockey
back<00:04:15.689> over<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.349> quickest<00:04:16.739> way<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.099> it<00:04:17.250> get

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
back over the quickest way to do it get

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.819 
back over the quickest way to do it get
the<00:04:17.579> end<00:04:17.759> of<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:17.969> spring<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.780> simply<00:04:19.199> push

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
the end of the spring and simply push

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.279 
the end of the spring and simply push
from<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.579> side<00:04:20.820> eventually<00:04:21.479> I'll<00:04:21.840> push<00:04:22.019> far

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
from this side eventually I'll push far

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.210 
from this side eventually I'll push far
enough<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:23.039> hook<00:04:23.219> onto<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:23.909> so<00:04:25.099> with

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
enough to hook onto here so with

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.980 
enough to hook onto here so with
spring<00:04:26.460> back<00:04:26.640> on<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.360> cable<00:04:27.780> tension

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
spring back on and the cable tension

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.410 
spring back on and the cable tension
nicely<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:29.340> may<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.760> be<00:04:29.820> worth<00:04:30.060> trying

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
nicely it may just be worth trying

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.920 
nicely it may just be worth trying
because<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:32.370> you've<00:04:33.060> tried<00:04:33.300> everything<00:04:33.510> else

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
because if you've tried everything else

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.690 
because if you've tried everything else
and<00:04:34.110> you're<00:04:34.230> not<00:04:34.350> sure<00:04:34.380> what's<00:04:34.740> going<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.220> and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and you're not sure what's going on and

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.060 
and you're not sure what's going on and
you<00:04:35.910> propels<00:04:36.570> just<00:04:36.810> stop<00:04:37.020> working<00:04:37.530> take<00:04:38.040> a

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
you propels just stop working take a

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.530 
you propels just stop working take a
look<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.520> back<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.700> your<00:04:38.880> arm<00:04:39.090> on<00:04:39.270> see<00:04:39.480> if

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
look in the back of your arm on see if

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.360 
look in the back of your arm on see if
this<00:04:39.720> Springs<00:04:40.080> there<00:04:40.410> because<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.010> lot<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.220> the

this Springs there because a lot of the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.340 
this Springs there because a lot of the

time if it's too slack it's come off

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.560 
time if it's too slack it's come off
it's<00:04:43.950> moved<00:04:44.190> away<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.090> push<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.420> back

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
it's moved away and if you push it back

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.480 
it's moved away and if you push it back
on<00:04:45.720> instead<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.050> hooking<00:04:46.170> it<00:04:46.440> back<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.800> tighten
