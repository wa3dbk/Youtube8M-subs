00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.550

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.690
 well we come with a new recipe and in 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 this time I'm going to make some meatballs 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.889
 tomato sauce is very simple the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.450
 recipe can go very well for 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 beginners so they are not very 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 advanced in the kitchen or having 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.300
 afraid to screw up or anything 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.090
 or for a day that we do not have many 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.680
 I want to spend so many hours in the kitchen 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 good in my channel have on the one hand the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.280
 recipe for ketchup and on the other 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.770
 side have the dick to carbonara 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.930
 meatballs with onions and the little 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.510
 sauce so if you want to throw a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'll try to leave it down in the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.410
 information box so they can 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.850
 be good because we go there the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 necessary will be as always because meat 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.079
 of beef and pork that comes to half this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.940
 It has 500 grams 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.350
 I'm going to use dry parsley and garlic in 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.929
 powder for what is meat 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.969
 normally only throw natural but not 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.289
 I have so I have done this then the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.280
 tomato sauce that I have for that 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.610
 oregano list that this is natural and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.399
 flour and of course salt and oil 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.899
 so let's go good then in a bowl 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.899
 I will put what is meat 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.880
 always with well-cleaned hands 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 berlin arrives 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.120
 I'm also inside if you want the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.890
 meat is much more tender puts it 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.890
 in the previous night with milk 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.180
 yes 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.500
 we add parsley if they have fresh much 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.030
 better I happen to be that today I do not have 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.030
 but I 'll put it well 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.170
 and we are going to put garlic powder 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.819
 If it makes you natural, what they do is 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.480
 a mixture of water and parsley and I know 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.480
 they throw up 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 well so you know and now we're going to 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.890
 put salt 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.060
 and now nothing would be a matter of kneading 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.060
 so that everything integrates well 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.160
 already if they want more quantity they buy 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.040
 more meat I always use half meat and 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.130
 half of pork so that this time 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.230
 so 250 and 250 so it is not so 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.629
 strong 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.190
 and they can also make them with meat 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.599
 Ground chicken like Mercadona 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.670
 who has also done what remains 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.599
 much more little legs for that does not 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.599
 lack of milk 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.799
 well we have the mass now we are going to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.959
 move on to what the meatballs are 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.010
 well let's move on to do what it is 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.010
 the shape 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.220
 to eat what is the dough 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.540
 and more or less it 's like a quantity 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.530
 normal and is not to do them or very 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.530
 big or very small 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.650
 and now with the same hands to it 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.550
 I'm giving it a rounded shape 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.550
 I'm going as crushing to stay 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.550
 compact 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.130
 I'm shaping and at the same time I do not know if 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.050
 see that I'm going as crushing 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.580
 because it is so that it remains so 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.340
 compact 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.510
 and nothing happened 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.220
 we continue to make another 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.629
 and so with all they want to do 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.519
 the smaller ones make it more 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.989
 small ones who want to do it 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.560
 bigger as the big one here already 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.819
 neither man like you go 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.019
 to go there they will make a ball of 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:22.269
 soccer but let's see there are no problems 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.269
 that the size is to your liking 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.950
 so I'm going to stay doing 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.050
 balls 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.050
 to go to fry the 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.249
 well we put a pan with plenty 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:43.319
 oil and here I have them ready 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.319
 let's move on to frying 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.310
 and once we will add them to the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.949
 sauces 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.900
 on the other hand it is a white rice with 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.610
 short fried and good can you 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 accompany with what they arrive with potatoes 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.000
 with rice and in this case to accompany 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.710
 rice 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.720
 on the other hand we already put the stay of 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.340
 take it in a postman to warm up for 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.770
 with once in install go back to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.139
 add it once they have fried 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.699
 we add to the tomato sauce 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.289
 if you want more sauce add more as 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.930
 I always say and we're going to add a 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.940
 little bit of orengo 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.940
 and now we return it all 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.240
