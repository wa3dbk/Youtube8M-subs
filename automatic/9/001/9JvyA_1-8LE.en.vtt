alice monsaert and i'm going to give you
an<00:00:09.750> easy<00:00:09.929> way<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.170> calculate<00:00:10.530> just<00:00:11.099> how<00:00:11.219> many

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
an easy way to calculate just how many

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
an easy way to calculate just how many
calories<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.849> should<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.210> ingesting<00:00:12.719> during

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
calories you should be ingesting during

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.550 
calories you should be ingesting during
the<00:00:13.620> day<00:00:14.750> we're<00:00:15.750> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> take<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.260> weight

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
the day we're going to take the weight

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
the day we're going to take the weight
so<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.220> current<00:00:17.580> weight<00:00:17.730> right<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.180> we're

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
so your current weight right now we're

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.210 
so your current weight right now we're
going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> work<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.199> simplicity<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
going to work with for simplicity a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.509 
going to work with for simplicity a
person<00:00:20.699> who's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> hundred<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.390> fifty<00:00:21.630> pounds

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
person who's a hundred and fifty pounds

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
person who's a hundred and fifty pounds
so<00:00:23.519> 150<00:00:24.240> pounds<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
so 150 pounds and we're going to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.040 
so 150 pounds and we're going to
multiply<00:00:25.529> by<00:00:26.310> their<00:00:26.490> activity<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.990> do

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
multiply by their activity that they do

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.009 
multiply by their activity that they do
during<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> day<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:29.369> multiply<00:00:29.910> by<00:00:30.330> 10<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:30.929> i

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
during the day so i multiply by 10 if i

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389 
during the day so i multiply by 10 if i
do<00:00:31.080> moderate<00:00:31.529> activity<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:32.130> may<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
do moderate activity which may be

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
do moderate activity which may be
walking<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.840> light<00:00:34.050> weight<00:00:34.260> training

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
walking in some light weight training

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.479 
walking in some light weight training
model<00:00:35.660> plied<00:00:36.660> by<00:00:36.690> 12<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.410> i<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.590> hard<00:00:37.950> activity

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
model plied by 12 if i do hard activity

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
model plied by 12 if i do hard activity
you<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:39.239> i'm<00:00:39.329> endurance<00:00:39.780> runner<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you know when i'm endurance runner or a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
you know when i'm endurance runner or a
cyclist<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.820> maybe<00:00:42.600> teach<00:00:42.930> several

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cyclist and I and I maybe teach several

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.729 
cyclist and I and I maybe teach several
classes<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> day<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> fitness<00:00:45.120> instructor

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
classes a day as a fitness instructor

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
classes a day as a fitness instructor
vigorous<00:00:46.739> activity<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.460> definitely<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
vigorous activity is definitely a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
vigorous activity is definitely a
marathon<00:00:48.420> runner<00:00:49.070> repetitive<00:00:50.070> activity

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
marathon runner repetitive activity

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.389 
marathon runner repetitive activity
would<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> someone<00:00:51.329> who<00:00:51.710> lays<00:00:52.710> brick<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.250> day

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
would be someone who lays brick all day

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.049 
would be someone who lays brick all day
long<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:54.059> delivers<00:00:54.840> UPS<00:00:55.710> boxes<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.520> that's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
long or delivers UPS boxes so that's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
long or delivers UPS boxes so that's
their<00:00:57.270> activity<00:00:57.809> level<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
their activity level and we're going to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
their activity level and we're going to
multiply<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.670> again<00:01:00.059> by<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> wait<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.870> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
multiply that again by the wait to get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.130 
multiply that again by the wait to get
our<00:01:01.170> basic<00:01:01.949> calories<00:01:02.430> per<00:01:02.640> day<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.850> let's<00:01:03.809> do

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
our basic calories per day so let's do

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
our basic calories per day so let's do
someone<00:01:04.650> who<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.070> moderate<00:01:05.519> activity<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
someone who has moderate activity and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.560 
someone who has moderate activity and
we're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> notice<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.100> need

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
we're going to notice that they need

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.710 
we're going to notice that they need
1,500<00:01:09.570> calories<00:01:10.140> per<00:01:10.439> day<00:01:11.299> most<00:01:12.299> people<00:01:12.570> say

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
1,500 calories per day most people say

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
1,500 calories per day most people say
wow<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> seems<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> lot<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.400> eat<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
wow that seems like a lot if you eat the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
wow that seems like a lot if you eat the
right<00:01:14.880> kinds<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> food<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
right kinds of food it can be a lot of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.499 
right kinds of food it can be a lot of
food<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> greet<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> wrong<00:01:18.000> foods<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
food if you greet the wrong foods and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.700 
food if you greet the wrong foods and
you're<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.720> eating<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> food

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you're just eating a little bit of food

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.580 
you're just eating a little bit of food
so<00:01:20.369> 1500<00:01:20.970> calories<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> day<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> person

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so 1500 calories a day for a person

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.609 
so 1500 calories a day for a person
that's<00:01:22.740> 150<00:01:23.490> pounds<00:01:24.000> times<00:01:24.630> their<00:01:24.990> activity

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that's 150 pounds times their activity

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
that's 150 pounds times their activity
level<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> weight<00:01:27.659> loss

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
level now if they're on a weight loss

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.670 
level now if they're on a weight loss
program<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> subtract<00:01:29.780> 200<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.470> 500

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
program we want to subtract 200 to 500

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
program we want to subtract 200 to 500
calories<00:01:32.460> per<00:01:32.700> day<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.420> either<00:01:33.509> need<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
calories per day so they either need to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.670 
calories per day so they either need to
exercise<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.400> ingest<00:01:36.329> last<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.439> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
exercise more or ingest last so this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
exercise more or ingest last so this
person<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.000> about

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
person would actually go down to about

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.350 
person would actually go down to about
1,200<00:01:39.570> calories<00:01:40.170> per<00:01:40.680> day<00:01:40.759> never<00:01:41.759> lower<00:01:42.090> than

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
1,200 calories per day never lower than

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
1,200 calories per day never lower than
a<00:01:42.390> thousand<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:44.159> need

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
a thousand and really most people need

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.510 
a thousand and really most people need
about<00:01:44.549> 1,500<00:01:44.970> calories<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> day<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.649> again<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
about 1,500 calories a day so again a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
about 1,500 calories a day so again a
simple<00:01:48.000> calculation<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.020> person

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
simple calculation so if this person
