00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.259
 heard instead of the rapid development of the village he 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 watches the decline of hot water here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.040
 never seen that cold drinking

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.130
 volume itself a system on itself no harm 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.010
 cause because if the system is somehow 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.020
 will be rebuilt converted into some kind 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 the better side is already that system 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.280
 which we are seeing today led by 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.180
 these people it will not be

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.520
 Presidentâ€™s responsibility in this 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 question I think paramount because 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.870
 what government he creates if 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.459
 the government does not perform and not 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.260
 copes with those tasks 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 which penny put means not 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.340
 copes the president himself 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.080
 but hardly thinks President and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.000
 his government can talk about it 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.860
 if you track all performances but 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.570
 Sultan Nazarbayev from year to year 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.760
 the permanent leader of Kazakhstan 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.800
 arranges similar debriefing of 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.180
 results can be judged by today's 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.180
 extended government meeting
