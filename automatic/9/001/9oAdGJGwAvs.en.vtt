00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.490 
occlusion training question are there
any<00:00:23.269> studies<00:00:23.660> or<00:00:23.900> information<00:00:24.380> out<00:00:24.470> there

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
any studies or information out there

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620 
any studies or information out there
about<00:00:24.730> how<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:25.880> kind<00:00:26.059> of<00:00:26.180> training<00:00:26.419> would

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
about how this kind of training would

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.569 
about how this kind of training would
affect<00:00:26.960> an<00:00:27.109> older<00:00:27.529> lift<00:00:27.739> your<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.039> also<00:00:28.340> blood

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
affect an older lift your and also blood

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.970 
affect an older lift your and also blood
clotting<00:00:28.939> issues<00:00:29.239> blood<00:00:30.019> planning<00:00:30.469> issues<00:00:30.800> in

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
clotting issues blood planning issues in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.770 
clotting issues blood planning issues in
older<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:31.460> most<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.239> research<00:00:32.570> is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
older so most of the research is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.979 
older so most of the research is
actually<00:00:33.199> done<00:00:33.379> on<00:00:33.559> older<00:00:34.129> folks<00:00:34.960> you<00:00:35.960> know

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
actually done on older folks you know

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.630 
actually done on older folks you know
because<00:00:36.350> those<00:00:36.500> are<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> folks<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:37.040> can<00:00:37.399> load

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
because those are the folks you can load

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.829 
because those are the folks you can load
because<00:00:37.850> they<00:00:37.970> like<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.329> break<00:00:38.480> their<00:00:38.690> hips

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
because they like to break their hips

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.399 
because they like to break their hips
for<00:00:39.079> no<00:00:39.199> frickin<00:00:39.559> reason<00:00:39.670> so<00:00:40.930> not<00:00:41.930> most<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.290> it

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
for no frickin reason so not most of it

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.639 
for no frickin reason so not most of it
but<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.530> lot<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.070> anyways<00:00:43.809> um<00:00:44.809> yeah

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
but a lot of it is anyways um yeah

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.740 
but a lot of it is anyways um yeah
there's<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:46.010> lot<00:00:46.370> of<00:00:46.399> research<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.089> actually

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
there's a lot of research and actually

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.189 
there's a lot of research and actually
my<00:00:47.899> friend<00:00:48.290> Jeremy<00:00:48.829> he<00:00:49.219> he<00:00:49.910> is<00:00:50.179> the<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.780> blood

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
my friend Jeremy he he is the the blood

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.180 
my friend Jeremy he he is the the blood
flow<00:00:51.379> restriction<00:00:51.850> guru<00:00:54.010> yeah<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.039> think

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
flow restriction guru yeah I think

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.290 
flow restriction guru yeah I think
there's<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:55.730> i<00:00:57.010> think<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.579> no<00:00:58.969> longer

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
there's a i think it's it's no longer

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.579 
there's a i think it's it's no longer
about<00:00:59.690> whether<00:01:00.199> or<00:01:00.320> not<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.820> works<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:03.170> just

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
about whether or not it works it's just

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.779 
about whether or not it works it's just
more<00:01:04.009> so<00:01:05.740> kind<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.860> like<00:01:07.070> we<00:01:07.250> talked<00:01:07.460> about<00:01:07.550> the

think<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.230> know<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.380> it's<00:02:15.890> okay<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.430> a

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
think so you know you it's okay to be a

hyper<00:02:16.790> focus<00:02:17.239> athlete<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:18.079> think<00:02:18.410> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
hyper focus athlete I just think that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.420 
hyper focus athlete I just think that
it's<00:02:21.530> interesting<00:02:21.799> when<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.160> comes<00:02:22.310> to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's interesting when it comes to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's interesting when it comes to
bodybuilding<00:02:22.910> because<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:23.359> not<00:02:23.540> our

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
bodybuilding because it's not our

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.990 
bodybuilding because it's not our
full-time<00:02:23.900> jobs<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> mean<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.310> okay<00:02:25.639> Brett

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
full-time jobs so I mean it's okay Brett

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.390 
full-time jobs so I mean it's okay Brett
Favre<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.690> know<00:02:26.980> doesn't<00:02:27.980> take<00:02:28.160> phone<00:02:28.370> calls

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Favre you know doesn't take phone calls

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.550 
Favre you know doesn't take phone calls
and<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.329> slams<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.870> door<00:02:29.900> because<00:02:30.199> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and you just slams the door because it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.589 
and you just slams the door because it
skin<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.040> guess<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.730> not<00:02:31.880> actually<00:02:32.330> okay

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
skin I guess it's not actually okay

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.500 
skin I guess it's not actually okay
black<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> hope<00:02:33.980> red<00:02:34.250> never<00:02:34.459> did<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.849> but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510

kind of leaks onto other parts of your
life<00:02:59.410> again<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.440> think<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:01.190> every<00:03:01.970> diet

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
life again I think with every diet

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.150 
life again I think with every diet
you're<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.319> get<00:03:03.530> rid<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.980> stuff

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
you're going to get rid of the stuff

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.509 
you're going to get rid of the stuff
that<00:03:04.220> doesn't<00:03:04.790> matter<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:06.310> you're<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.400> to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
that doesn't matter or you're going to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.190 
that doesn't matter or you're going to
be<00:03:07.640> wasting<00:03:08.120> less<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.510> less<00:03:08.630> motion<00:03:08.900> with

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
be wasting less and less motion with

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680 
be wasting less and less motion with
every<00:03:09.530> single<00:03:10.010> diet<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.489> think<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.970> think

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
every single diet and I think I think

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.289 
every single diet and I think I think
it's<00:03:12.470> really<00:03:12.709> important<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:14.120> become

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
it's really important that you become

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's really important that you become
self-aware<00:03:14.900> with<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.500> your<00:03:16.069> own<00:03:16.220> emotions<00:03:16.640> I

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
self-aware with with your own emotions I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.860 
self-aware with with your own emotions I
think<00:03:16.910> that's<00:03:17.090> going<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.299> go<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.480> long<00:03:17.660> way

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
think that's going to go a long way

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.240 
think that's going to go a long way
emotional<00:03:18.590> intelligence<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:19.220> very

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
emotional intelligence is very

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.789 
emotional intelligence is very
underrated<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.959> then<00:03:21.110> also<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.650> some

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
underrated and then also get some

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.199 
underrated and then also get some
feedback<00:03:22.010> from<00:03:22.190> your<00:03:22.400> friends<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.180> know

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
where you can you know make up some

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.250 
where you can you know make up some
ground<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.060> you'll<00:03:26.569> see<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:26.989> every

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
ground and you'll see there with every

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.600 
ground and you'll see there with every
contest<00:03:27.620> prep<00:03:27.890> yeah<00:03:28.130> you'll<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.310> hyper

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
focused but over time it will kind of

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.560 
focused but over time it will kind of
diminish<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:36.980> only<00:03:37.239> told<00:03:38.239> me<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.540> only

competing um like how would you define
the<00:04:01.190> line<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.430> guess<00:04:01.700> between<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:02.450> maybe<00:04:03.200> for

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
the line I guess between like maybe for

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.050 
the line I guess between like maybe for
someone<00:04:04.280> who<00:04:04.400> does<00:04:04.579> it<00:04:04.730> as<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:05.030> a

someone who does it as like a
recreational<00:04:05.750> copy<00:04:06.040> rather<00:04:07.040> than<00:04:07.220> natural
