 I admit it I like my amount Denic and the 70 6 megapixels and 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.140
 they will last a few more years 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.570
 even though the d5000 heats me up a bit twelve times 3 megapixels are one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.500
 Lot of wood 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.550
