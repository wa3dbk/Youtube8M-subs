00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.719
 hi on the truth and today I 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.110
 I'll tell you about the strike we do not have the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.400
 right to take hostage users 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.420
 I send you there is put away 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920
 to have a step it looks like a take 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.210
 of hostages you saw Kalashnikovs in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 the stations of namur 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.140
 I went there I will not cross a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.180
 bearded railwayman and a Kalashnikov who 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.650
 does a rodeo with his tgv will do 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.700
 maybe mess with me either this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 would be ranking note that would be 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.580
 fun 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 after yes it's boring a strike it's 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 true it's boring it's like that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.699
 strike of the sncf it is relou then you have 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.289
 strikers they said to themselves we're not going 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.969
 annoy the users we'll just do 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.379
 at the boss and we will make a fat 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.050
 of the gratuity that is to say that we will 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 roll the trains in the normal way 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.989
 except that people do not need 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.550
 to pay to go upstairs down to these 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 guys there to believe that they have too much 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.469
 good idea because they almost went 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.809
 in jail 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.159
 the sncf complained against them have 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.609
 they are taken almond mena who have 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.409
 fired 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.089
 so you see the goal it's not necessarily 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.749
 to piss off people like us who 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.449
 take the train 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.920
 it's a collateral effect this addition a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.719
 call of duty you know what a shot is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 allies well it's the same he was old 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.330
 today have conditions of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.740
 transport that are bad it's our 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.390
 everyday we know very well so in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.620
 train or even why why they 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.730
 will be at the ace far strike so all the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.420
 world is to get high to everyone 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.340
 the trash 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 they lose their salary and where at the end 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.280
 of a moment they may have a good 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.140
 reason you see the government 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.120
 French to 97.6 from iweb to what we're going 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 do is privatize the sncf 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.540
 and then we go there cut in half we're going 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.160
 put on one hand give you the rai of 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.210
 the other side we will put the trains these 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.530
 cons there they forgot that the trains 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 roll on the rails and that if both 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.650
 are not coordinated it does not work 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150
 it does not work because the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.480
 box since she lost 10 billion 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.910
 euros 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.470
 and since that's the brothel you 're going 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.180
 more and more trains more and 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.770
 worse maintained you have rails or 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 work they are less and less done 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.690
 both bodies gives super bad when he 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 must finally it's the brothel so after 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.170
 can you tell me what happened to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.480
 private and then with the competition they 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 will have to do well at the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.360
 competition they will be forced to do 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 well, we're okay, it's clear, you see in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.080
 England trains are private since 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.730
 the 80s it works of thunder 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.850
 it's the biggest number of accidents 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.470
 in europe and between christmas and new year 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.870
 as there are fewer travelers they have 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.580
 decided that it was not profitable 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.490
 so he is no transgender not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.930
 at all there is no tran it's a 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.100
 asshole in tie who thought that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.110
 did not bring enough money 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 maybe you're working on the 24 10 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.320
 we would still like to Christmas with your 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.290
 bah family you fuck you 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.580
 because overall you're not profitable 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.350
 your life serves no purpose does not relate 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.250
 money is a little against that which is 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.480
 beat the guys because in the end 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.550
 what do they ask the strikers 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.340
 there he asks something that is asked 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.630
 a box that works properly 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 who puts the means for the trains 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.130
 they arrive on time in good condition and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.540
 that the rails works with a chain 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.220
 August classic to guys who 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.050
 think guys who decides and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.310
 guys doing things with enough 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.360
 ways for the guys who have to 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.860
 maintain low rails could 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.060
 to maintain the rails enough means 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.080
 for the guys who have to maintain 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.380
 trains can maintain the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.000
 trains and incidentally that guys 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.680
 are properly paid that we stop 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 of the ardor that it is useless 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 stop art say it's big 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.970
 privileged then so much half who 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.590
 are at the smic 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.000
 finally I do not know you but me to work 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.350
 in a box where one of a day on 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.870
 the other receives instructions that are 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.630
 contradictory where I am told that I have a 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.100
 big that is useless and that if I open 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.140
 my mouth I get screwed by 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.280
 the whole universe that would piss me off 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.720
 so we can understand that they are 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
 still venerate guys maybe 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.450
 he would rather that it is breaking 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.910
 the balls to piss off the poor country 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.989
 who is on his train at 6 o'clock 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 morning yet it is beautiful it is 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.340
 think a little and go see the stage 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.170
 above floor above it is the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.610
 asshole in tie who decides 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.560
 to raise rates while removing 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.760
 to be years old who decides that repair the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.140
 rails now it's too expensive we're going 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.790
 wait is really rotten and that is 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.290
 an accident that decides we will buy 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.650
 trains too wide so he goes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.440
 plan the platforms that decides 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.519
 schedules of the bills to which you 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.180
 would like to be able to go home 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.790
 which in fact you can not short is 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.790
 ball that in the end what is what makes 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.440
 down he takes your life he takes my life there 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.600
 takes life all the masters who 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.890
 have to take the train or the rer 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.370
 subway is what you want to go 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.720
 to work 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.820
 and what does he do with whom to play 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.610
 to sims play sims 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.900
 so what's a sims that closes his 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.610
 mouth but that's good because we 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.989
 is not a sims so one day will have to 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.390
 maybe see to think 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.390
 See you 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.390
 Oh 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.289
 it
