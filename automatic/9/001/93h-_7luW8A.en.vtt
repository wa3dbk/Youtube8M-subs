00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
like vacation to be honest um compared

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
like vacation to be honest um compared
to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> curly<00:01:08.729> hair<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.240> sometimes<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to the curly hair because sometimes you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.570 
to the curly hair because sometimes you
get<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:11.159> tangles<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> back<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
get some tangles in the back and it's I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
get some tangles in the back and it's I
think<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.080> work<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
think it's a little bit more work to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
think it's a little bit more work to
deal<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.939> curly<00:01:18.270> hair<00:01:18.479> than<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
deal with the curly hair than the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.330 
deal with the curly hair than the
straight<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> straight<00:01:20.159> hair

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
straight here because the straight hair

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
straight here because the straight hair
is<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.000> hangs<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.610> could
