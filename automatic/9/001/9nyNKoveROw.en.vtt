00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 security measures in the house 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.340
 or the lupita or the whole or the little hand 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.980
 here because it did not come with you go to your 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.590
 home but her mom told me she could not 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.470
 go out and play because it hurts a lot 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.100
 stomach is that I feel very little of the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.540
 liquid from an unknown bottle 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.540
 thinking it was soda 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.650
 he asked his form and he could take from the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.690
 My mom always told me that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.800
 before taking a liquid should be 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.170
 sure that nothing does harm in the bottle 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.980
 that will pose different substances and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.740
 not all the rum to drink if my mom 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 says that even if I 'm home I should 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 take care of myself so as not to have accidents 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.960
 said not to play in the kitchen because 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 there are many risks like the one 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.360
 Mars with the stove with food 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.600
 boiling can take a lighter 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.130
 if the cut you with the knives about 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.130
 everything when you're running 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.360
 thank you for two months that's why you do not have to 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.690
 run on the stairs since you can 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.060
 fall if they have also told me in my house 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.450
 and no oriental alter in the armchairs or in 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.110
 the bed and I used to do it until a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.500
 day I fell and hit me in the head from 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.940
 then I do not do it it hurt a lot and I 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.910
 a chipote came out to be in places 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.630
 high for example doors on the roof 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.630
 when 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 that's why it's better to ask a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 adult to give you the things that are in 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.800
 high places is always important 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.520
 take care of and care for our little brothers 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.430
 especially if they are smaller because 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.330
 they also pay to suffer accidents in 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.360
 the house when playing with plastic bags 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.640
 when using ropes or when they get into 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.060
 things in the mouth 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.010
 as medicine 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.530
 marbles buttons 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.319
 etc 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.450
 Well, my teacher at school told us 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.940
 that it is dangerous to put objects in 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.600
 electrical outlets because you can 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.930
 electrocute a certain there are many 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.450
 risks in the house that's why we should be 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.270
 careful then herrera 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.580
 and that can be recovered quickly for 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.420
 come and play with us while 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.420
 so much
