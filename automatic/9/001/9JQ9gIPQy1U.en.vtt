 for guitar so they can sing it is 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.759
 a song of my favorites of gustavo 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 cerati is a shame what happened to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.139
 gustavo for me is one of the most iconic 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 great rock in Spanish in short that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 [Music] 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 in totally lower fingers now 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.780
 we go down or fourth and we play 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.510
 first and second simultaneously 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.060
 [Music] 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.599
 all right 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.599
 i 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.720
 after in sustained sun minor is equal 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.720
 again like we did in me 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.270
 with may in 6a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.840
 [Music] 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.550
 is eating empty in 5a 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.750
 [Music] 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.780
 F sharp lower low in sixth 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.930
 [Music] 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.930
 and in itself go down or in 5a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 because there we are going to do it very slowly is 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.810
 twenty-one 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.920
 wait for me 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.459
 with everything 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.459
 and 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:41.540
 [Music] 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.800
 ok we go with second verse a little more 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.800
 Quick 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.740
 on fire 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.310
 [Music] 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.880
 in a slow 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.880
 blah 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.680
 goes sharp 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.300
 and we finish the century 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.390
 [Music] 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.980
 ok later we are going to give you more input 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.150
 with a strum 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.009
 [Music] 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.959
 the trait is very simple and nothing else 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:28.120

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:29.890

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.080
 extras we will use the minor with 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.090
 sustained minor and sun sustained minor is 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.700
