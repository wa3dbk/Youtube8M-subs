00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
everything of the difference between the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.080 
everything of the difference between the
galaxy<00:01:42.360> s2<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.320> galaxy<00:01:43.710> s3<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.430> insane

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
galaxy s2 and the galaxy s3 it's insane

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
galaxy s2 and the galaxy s3 it's insane
ice<00:01:45.630> watch<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.170> video<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.710> saw<00:01:47.369> 38<00:01:48.329> things<00:01:49.369> 38

ice watch a video I saw 38 things 38

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
ice watch a video I saw 38 things 38
good<00:01:50.880> reasons<00:01:51.390> why<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> an<00:01:51.869> update<00:01:52.200> from

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
good reasons why you an update from

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
good reasons why you an update from
galaxy<00:01:53.220> s2<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> galaxy<00:01:54.119> s3<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.409> they

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
galaxy s2 to a galaxy s3 because they

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
galaxy s2 to a galaxy s3 because they
change<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.280> many<00:01:56.610> things<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.540> even

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
change so many things that I didn't even

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.010 
change so many things that I didn't even

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
many small things that I didn't even

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.710

think<00:02:19.340> about<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.700> they<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.090> changed

inside<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.690> harder<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.900> both<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
inside and in harder on both the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.700 
inside and in harder on both the
software<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.770> course<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.760> think<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.570> extra<00:02:26.840> s3

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710
