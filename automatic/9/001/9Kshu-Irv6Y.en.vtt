so unfortunately you're not going to see

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.990 
so unfortunately you're not going to see
an<00:00:20.050> unboxing<00:00:20.350> video<00:00:20.800> of<00:00:20.860> it<00:00:21.039> on<00:00:21.250> my<00:00:21.550> channel

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
an unboxing video of it on my channel

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.750 
an unboxing video of it on my channel
and<00:00:22.930> when<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:23.080> try<00:00:23.410> this<00:00:23.650> truck<00:00:23.920> out<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.400> must

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
and when I try this truck out I must

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.400 
and when I try this truck out I must
admit<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.090> wasn't<00:00:25.420> quite<00:00:25.539> sure<00:00:25.600> whether<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:26.080> was

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
admit I wasn't quite sure whether I was

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.350 
admit I wasn't quite sure whether I was
going<00:00:26.530> to<00:00:26.619> keep<00:00:26.890> it<00:00:27.100> but<00:00:27.640> after<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.940> couple<00:00:28.150> of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
going to keep it but after a couple of

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.210 
going to keep it but after a couple of
guys<00:00:28.510> I<00:00:28.539> actually<00:00:28.810> realized<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:29.680> really

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
guys I actually realized that I really

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.189 
guys I actually realized that I really
do<00:00:30.400> like<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.820> truck<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.779> rather<00:00:31.960> than

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
do like the truck and rather than

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.139 
do like the truck and rather than
selling<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.739> getting<00:00:33.219> rid<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.429> it<00:00:33.640> in<00:00:33.760> some<00:00:33.940> way

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
selling it getting rid of it in some way

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.209 
selling it getting rid of it in some way
I<00:00:34.449> think<00:00:34.749> it<00:00:35.079> I<00:00:35.260> might<00:00:35.649> do<00:00:35.769> a<00:00:35.800> little<00:00:36.010> bit<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.190> a

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
I think it I might do a little bit of a

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.279 
I think it I might do a little bit of a
project<00:00:36.460> with<00:00:36.789> this<00:00:36.940> drop<00:00:37.210> out<00:00:37.390> looking<00:00:37.780> you

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
project with this drop out looking you

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.779 
project with this drop out looking you
know<00:00:38.319> this<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.679> worthy<00:00:38.949> of<00:00:39.159> something

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
know this is worthy of something

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.419 
know this is worthy of something
different<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.839> what<00:00:41.499> you're<00:00:41.710> watching<00:00:42.280> is

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
different so what you're watching is

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.779 
different so what you're watching is
just<00:00:42.699> basically<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:44.229> running<00:00:44.920> video<00:00:45.249> just<00:00:45.670> to

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
just basically a running video just to

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.669 
just basically a running video just to
give<00:00:46.030> us<00:00:46.149> all<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.389> bit<00:00:46.659> of<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.780> benchmark<00:00:47.379> as<00:00:47.530> to

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
give us all a bit of a benchmark as to

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.590 
give us all a bit of a benchmark as to
where<00:00:47.889> the<00:00:48.069> truck<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.519> actually<00:00:48.699> sitting

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
where the truck is actually sitting

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.649 
where the truck is actually sitting
performance<00:00:50.409> wise<00:00:50.999> what<00:00:51.999> I'm<00:00:52.089> going<00:00:52.329> to<00:00:52.420> do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
performance wise what I'm going to do

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.899 
performance wise what I'm going to do
with<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.109> truck<00:00:53.379> though<00:00:53.649> is<00:00:54.339> going<00:00:54.639> to<00:00:54.699> remain

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
with the truck though is going to remain

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.840 
with the truck though is going to remain
a<00:00:54.969> little<00:00:55.179> bit<00:00:55.359> of<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.479> secret<00:00:55.870> but<00:00:56.079> I<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:57.699> tell

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
a little bit of a secret but I can tell

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.279 
a little bit of a secret but I can tell
you<00:00:57.969> that<00:00:58.059> it's<00:00:58.239> going<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.479> look<00:00:58.569> dramatically

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
you that it's going to look dramatically

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.099 
you that it's going to look dramatically
different<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.519> also<00:01:00.760> going<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.479> perform

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
different and it's also going to perform

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.840 
different and it's also going to perform
differently<00:01:02.769> as<00:01:02.979> well<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.639> going<00:01:03.729> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
differently as well so it's going to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.450 
differently as well so it's going to
have<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:03.999> new<00:01:04.210> power<00:01:04.449> plant<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:05.460> yeah

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
have a new power plant and yeah

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.240 
have a new power plant and yeah
hopefully<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.200> good<00:01:08.229> really<00:01:09.009> going<00:01:09.189> to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
hopefully it's a good really going to

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.670 
hopefully it's a good really going to
have<00:01:09.399> some<00:01:09.610> get<00:01:09.789> up<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.090> go<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:10.990> if<00:01:11.530> you
