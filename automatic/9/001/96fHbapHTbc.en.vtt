00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
multitasking obviously because I can now

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
multitasking obviously because I can now
hop<00:01:46.049> around<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> used<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
hop around the way I used to I'm a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
hop around the way I used to I'm a
Logitech<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
Logitech actually a lot better because I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
Logitech actually a lot better because I
can<00:01:50.040> manage<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.369> spaces<00:01:50.759> even<00:01:50.850> quicker

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
can manage my spaces even quicker

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
without having to think about it I can

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.319

want or back up or vice versa mm-hmm I
even<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.880> for<00:01:59.880> example<00:02:00.320> let's<00:02:01.320> say<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
even have for example let's say I'm in a

even have for example let's say I'm in a
subfolder<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:05.119> even<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.270> set<00:02:06.509> up<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:07.020> where

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
subfolder I even have it set up to where

subfolder I even have it set up to where
I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.840> two<00:02:09.840> finger<00:02:09.989> mm-hmm

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I think it's up to a two finger mm-hmm

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.600 
I think it's up to a two finger mm-hmm
we'll<00:02:12.870> take<00:02:13.020> me<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.500> level<00:02:13.920> Tooting<00:02:14.520> her

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.710 
we'll take me up a level Tooting her
down<00:02:14.760> will<00:02:14.880> take<00:02:14.910> me<00:02:15.060> back<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.360> where<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> was

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
down will take me back to where I was

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.620 
down will take me back to where I was
similar<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.710> command<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.340> basically<00:02:17.630> command

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
similar to command is basically command

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.310 
similar to command is basically command
up<00:02:18.840> mm-hmm<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.690> still<00:02:21.870> getting<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.170> don't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
up mm-hmm so I'm still getting I don't

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.710 
up mm-hmm so I'm still getting I don't
use<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.860> often<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.310> I'm<00:02:23.490> hitting<00:02:24.240> three

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
use that that often so I'm hitting three

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.190 
use that that often so I'm hitting three
because<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.260> forget<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.880> just<00:02:27.750> got<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.960> set

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
because I forget but I just got it set

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.280 
because I forget but I just got it set
up<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.350> hopefully<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> lot<00:02:29.310> more

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
up so hopefully this would be a lot more

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.810 
up so hopefully this would be a lot more
efficient<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> give<00:02:32.160> me<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.280> chance<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.730> move

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
efficient and give me a chance to move

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.480 
efficient and give me a chance to move
around<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.360> better<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:35.040> as<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.370> can

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
around a little better but as you can

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.550 
around a little better but as you can
see<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.000> let<00:02:36.120> me<00:02:36.240> let<00:02:37.080> me<00:02:37.110> head<00:02:37.290> back<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
see and let me let me head back to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.830 
see and let me let me head back to

I'm tweaking so still playing with those

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.330 
I'm tweaking so still playing with those
maybe<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:40.019> just<00:03:40.050> needs<00:03:40.410> an<00:03:40.500> update<00:03:40.620> or<00:03:40.980> maybe

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
maybe it just needs an update or maybe

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.759 
maybe it just needs an update or maybe
I'm<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.550> an<00:03:41.730> idiot<00:03:42.000> either<00:03:42.720> way<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.500> update

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
I'm just an idiot either way the update

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.440 
I'm just an idiot either way the update
is<00:03:43.980> solid<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:44.459> good<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.239> worth

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
is solid it's good and it's worth

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.509 
is solid it's good and it's worth

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
Mouse to give the extra functionality

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.830 
Mouse to give the extra functionality
you<00:03:51.330> need<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:53.220> get<00:03:53.340> spaces<00:03:53.760> expose<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.630> your

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you need to get spaces expose and your

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.120 
you need to get spaces expose and your
middle<00:03:54.989> finger<00:03:55.080> click<00:03:55.500> back<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:55.980> would

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
middle finger click back that you would

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.350 
middle finger click back that you would
at<00:03:56.220> most<00:03:56.310> Mouse's<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:56.910> now<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.180> goes<00:03:57.300> from

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
at most Mouse's so now it goes from

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.140 
at most Mouse's so now it goes from
being<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.930> mouse<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.950> limited<00:03:59.459> options<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.120> a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
mouse with way more options then you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.970 
mouse with way more options then you
will<00:04:02.970> probably<00:04:03.180> ever<00:04:03.510> need<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.230> your<00:04:04.470> life<00:04:04.650> I
