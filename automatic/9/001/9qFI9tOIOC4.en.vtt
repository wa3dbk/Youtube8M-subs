00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.680 

so<00:00:11.620> far<00:00:11.860> we<00:00:12.010> have<00:00:12.129> seen<00:00:12.400> that<00:00:13.120> an<00:00:13.299> inclined

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
so far we have seen that an inclined

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.950 
so far we have seen that an inclined
plane<00:00:13.870> can<00:00:14.320> be<00:00:14.440> used<00:00:14.650> as<00:00:14.950> a<00:00:15.010> simple<00:00:15.459> machine

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
plane can be used as a simple machine

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.679 
plane can be used as a simple machine
but<00:00:16.960> if<00:00:17.170> we<00:00:17.410> have<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.920> raise<00:00:18.099> a<00:00:18.400> load<00:00:18.790> that<00:00:19.540> is

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
but if we have to raise a load that is

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.420 
but if we have to raise a load that is
very<00:00:19.930> heavy<00:00:20.200> compared<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:21.009> the<00:00:21.130> effort

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
very heavy compared to the effort

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.550 
very heavy compared to the effort
available<00:00:21.880> then<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.869> mechanical<00:00:23.140> advantage

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
available then the mechanical advantage

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.299 
available then the mechanical advantage
needed<00:00:24.340> would<00:00:24.820> be<00:00:25.000> pretty<00:00:25.450> large<00:00:25.660> and<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.950> plane

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:27.309 
needed would be pretty large and a plane

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.950 
needed would be pretty large and a plane
that<00:00:28.000> rises<00:00:28.509> very<00:00:28.930> gently<00:00:29.470> will<00:00:30.279> be<00:00:30.430> needed

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that rises very gently will be needed

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.020 
that rises very gently will be needed
but<00:00:31.960> such<00:00:32.200> planes<00:00:32.559> become<00:00:33.250> too<00:00:33.489> long<00:00:33.760> and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
but such planes become too long and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.139 
but such planes become too long and
unwieldy<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.950> make<00:00:35.950> it<00:00:36.100> compact<00:00:36.489> without

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
unwieldy to make it compact without

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.760 
unwieldy to make it compact without
sacrificing<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.020> convenience<00:00:38.590> or

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
sacrificing the convenience or

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.400 
sacrificing the convenience or
mechanical<00:00:39.280> advantage<00:00:39.760> we<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.540> wind<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.170> or

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
mechanical advantage we can wind it or

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.580 
mechanical advantage we can wind it or
wrap<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.890> around<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.700> cylinder<00:00:43.260> let<00:00:44.260> us<00:00:44.380> see

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
wrap it around a cylinder let us see

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.130 
wrap it around a cylinder let us see
what<00:00:44.950> we<00:00:45.100> will<00:00:45.250> get<00:00:45.400> so<00:00:46.210> here<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.660> our<00:00:46.750> inclined

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
what we will get so here is our inclined

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.980 
what we will get so here is our inclined
plane<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.650> we<00:00:48.610> are<00:00:48.700> going<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.030> take<00:00:49.270> only<00:00:49.720> its

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
plane and we are going to take only its

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.350 
plane and we are going to take only its
top<00:00:50.320> surface<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.010> surface<00:00:51.370> that<00:00:51.850> is<00:00:52.030> really

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
top surface the surface that is really

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.950 
top surface the surface that is really
doing<00:00:52.630> the<00:00:52.780> job<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.350> raising<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.820> load<00:00:55.060> and<00:00:55.329> we

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
doing the job of raising the load and we

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.450 
doing the job of raising the load and we
are<00:00:56.050> going<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.260> wrap<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.739> around<00:00:56.920> this

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
are going to wrap it around this

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.750 
are going to wrap it around this
cylinder<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.230> let<00:00:59.380> us<00:00:59.500> set<00:00:59.710> it<00:00:59.829> in<00:00:59.950> motion<00:00:59.980> so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
cylinder so let us set it in motion so

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.190 
cylinder so let us set it in motion so
you<00:01:00.820> can<00:01:00.940> see<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.270> cylinder<00:01:01.540> is<00:01:01.780> rolling<00:01:02.110> and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
you can see the cylinder is rolling and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.130 
you can see the cylinder is rolling and
the<00:01:03.190> top<00:01:03.430> edge<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.269> inclined<00:01:04.629> plane<00:01:04.659> is

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the top edge of this inclined plane is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.800 
the top edge of this inclined plane is
getting<00:01:05.680> wound<00:01:06.100> on<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.790> cylinder<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.390> you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
getting wound on the cylinder and you

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.330 
getting wound on the cylinder and you
would<00:01:07.930> see<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.320> helix

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
would see a helix

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.240 
would see a helix
is<00:01:09.460> getting<00:01:10.000> formed<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.740> nothing

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
is getting formed and this is nothing

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.029 
is getting formed and this is nothing
but<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.670> thread<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.200> usually<00:01:14.380> see<00:01:14.649> on

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
but a thread that we usually see on

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.410 
but a thread that we usually see on
threaded<00:01:16.030> fasteners<00:01:16.270> like<00:01:16.719> nuts<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.590> bolts

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
threaded fasteners like nuts and bolts

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.529 
threaded fasteners like nuts and bolts
so<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.450> nut<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.409> bolt<00:01:20.439> pair<00:01:20.950> can<00:01:21.700> be<00:01:21.909> used<00:01:22.179> as

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
so a nut and a bolt pair can be used as

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.629 
so a nut and a bolt pair can be used as
a<00:01:22.719> substitute<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.469> more<00:01:23.649> compact<00:01:24.069> substitute

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
a substitute a more compact substitute

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.969 
a substitute a more compact substitute
for<00:01:25.149> an<00:01:25.270> inclined<00:01:25.600> plane<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.109> therefore<00:01:26.859> it

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
for an inclined plane and therefore it

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.480 
for an inclined plane and therefore it
can<00:01:27.159> also<00:01:27.340> act<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:27.969> a<00:01:28.209> simple<00:01:28.689> machine<00:01:29.490> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
can also act like a simple machine here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.639 
can also act like a simple machine here
is<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.939> physical<00:01:31.299> arrangement<00:01:31.929> of<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.409> screw

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
is the physical arrangement of a screw

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.239 
is the physical arrangement of a screw
jack<00:01:32.889> a<00:01:33.240> bolt<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.509> mounted<00:01:35.229> vertically<00:01:35.679> in<00:01:35.950> a

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
jack a bolt is mounted vertically in a

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.669 
jack a bolt is mounted vertically in a
fixed<00:01:36.549> support<00:01:36.840> engaging<00:01:37.840> with<00:01:38.139> the<00:01:38.229> bolt<00:01:38.439> is

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
fixed support engaging with the bolt is

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.819 
fixed support engaging with the bolt is
a<00:01:38.950> nut<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.999> which<00:01:40.209> a<00:01:40.450> long<00:01:40.810> handle<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.350> provided

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
a nut to which a long handle is provided

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.489 
a nut to which a long handle is provided
at<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.700> end<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:43.060> which<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.749> effort<00:01:44.109> can<00:01:44.350> be

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
at the end of which the effort can be

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.279 
at the end of which the effort can be
applied<00:01:45.100> with<00:01:45.310> help<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.389> the<00:01:46.539> effort<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.109> nut

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
applied with help of the effort the nut

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.730 
applied with help of the effort the nut
is<00:01:47.469> rotated<00:01:48.009> as<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.759> rotates<00:01:48.999> it<00:01:49.659> also<00:01:50.289> moves

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
is rotated as it rotates it also moves

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.519 
is rotated as it rotates it also moves
upward<00:01:51.219> in<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.700> axial<00:01:51.969> direction<00:01:52.569> pushing

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529 
upward in the axial direction pushing

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.429 
upward in the axial direction pushing
this<00:01:53.920> table<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.880> which<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.869> load<00:01:56.079> is<00:01:56.109> placed

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
this table on which the load is placed

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.209 
this table on which the load is placed
so<00:01:57.310> thereby<00:01:57.639> the<00:01:58.299> load<00:01:58.539> is<00:01:58.779> raised<00:01:59.319> let<00:01:59.920> us<00:02:00.039> see

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
so thereby the load is raised let us see

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.660 
so thereby the load is raised let us see
the<00:02:00.369> motion<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:02.079> can<00:02:02.259> see<00:02:02.469> the<00:02:03.069> effort<00:02:03.279> is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
the motion you can see the effort is

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.109 
the motion you can see the effort is
getting<00:02:04.029> displaced<00:02:04.270> around<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.289> circle<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:06.789> its

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
getting displaced around a circle so its

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.480 
getting displaced around a circle so its
displacement<00:02:07.779> will<00:02:07.899> be<00:02:07.929> 2<00:02:08.259> PI<00:02:08.500> R<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:09.069> R<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
displacement will be 2 PI R if R is the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.240 
displacement will be 2 PI R if R is the
radius<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.209> circle<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.800> distance

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
radius of that circle and the distance

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
radius of that circle and the distance
moved<00:02:12.640> by<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.690> load<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.650> each<00:02:15.810> rotation

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
moved by the load in each rotation

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.479 
moved by the load in each rotation
is<00:02:17.760> called<00:02:18.760> L<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.480> lead<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.769> we<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.040> calculate

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489
