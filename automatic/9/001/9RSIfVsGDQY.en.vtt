00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
actually have been thinking about

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
actually have been thinking about
getting<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.130> quite<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> while<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.269> pulled

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
getting for quite a while and I pulled

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.200 
getting for quite a while and I pulled
the<00:00:27.599> trigger<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> today<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.640> far<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.000> very

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the trigger on it today so far I'm very

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.999 
the trigger on it today so far I'm very
impressed<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.810> very<00:00:31.109> small<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.890> almost

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
impressed it's very small it almost

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.770 
impressed it's very small it almost
looks<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> toy<00:00:32.759> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.540> thing

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
looks like a toy when you get this thing

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
looks like a toy when you get this thing
but<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> quality<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.160> video<00:00:35.370> quality<00:00:35.850> seems

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
but the quality the video quality seems

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
but the quality the video quality seems
to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.480> pretty<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.350> far<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> going

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to be pretty good so far this is going

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
to be pretty good so far this is going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 
comments let me know what you think I
went<00:00:45.180> ahead<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.450> picked<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> microphone

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
went ahead and picked up a microphone

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
went ahead and picked up a microphone
for<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.730> sound<00:00:47.969> quality<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
for it as well the sound quality is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
for it as well the sound quality is
actually<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.559> these<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.890> all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
actually not very good with these at all

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
actually not very good with these at all
this<00:00:50.579> seems<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> make<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> quite<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.570> better

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this seems to make it quite a bit better

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
this seems to make it quite a bit better
so<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.710> hear<00:00:53.070> me<00:00:53.280> talking<00:00:53.730> and

so you can actually hear me talking and
it<00:00:54.870> canceled<00:00:55.199> cancels<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> sound

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it canceled cancels out all the sound

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.549

going to go pick up LCD BacPac which is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
going to go pick up LCD BacPac which is
just<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> viewfinder<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just like a viewfinder that you can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
just like a viewfinder that you can
attach<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.309> looking

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
attach the back of it so I'm looking

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.120 
attach the back of it so I'm looking
forward<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.240> well<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
forward to that as well and then I got a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
forward to that as well and then I got a
skeletonized<00:01:08.760> case<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> too<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
skeletonized case for it too so I can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
skeletonized case for it too so I can
put<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> tripod<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.939> plug<00:01:12.180> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
put it on a tripod and actually plug in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
put it on a tripod and actually plug in
the<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.260> microphone<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.040> side<00:01:14.310> jack<00:01:14.580> or

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the the microphone in the side jack or

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.490 
the the microphone in the side jack or
if<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.390> wanted<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:15.990> also<00:01:16.110> run<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
if I wanted to I could also run it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
if I wanted to I could also run it
straight<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> USB<00:01:17.189> while<00:01:17.610> recording<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
straight to a USB while recording I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.749 
straight to a USB while recording I
believe<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.530> upload<00:01:19.979> videos<00:01:20.280> straight<00:01:20.580> onto

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
believe to upload videos straight onto
