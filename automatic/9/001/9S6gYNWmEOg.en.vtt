boiling<00:01:27.719> so<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.289> gonna<00:01:28.439> put<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> guy<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
boiling so I'm gonna put this guy in

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.660 
boiling so I'm gonna put this guy in
here<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.689> doesn't<00:01:30.929> fit<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:32.280> doesn't<00:01:32.340> fit

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here and it doesn't fit it doesn't fit

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
here and it doesn't fit it doesn't fit
all<00:01:32.819> the<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.110> okay

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
all the way but that's okay

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
all the way but that's okay
this<00:01:34.950> should<00:01:35.130> take<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.399> little<00:01:35.850> short<00:01:36.210> while<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this should take a little short while to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.770 
this should take a little short while to
to<00:01:37.079> boil<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:37.799> must<00:01:38.219> stop<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.819> in<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.539> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to boil I must stop that in because it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480
