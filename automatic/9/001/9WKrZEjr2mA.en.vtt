00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello I am loÃ¯c write editor 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.420
 deputy chief of the fisherman of france and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.889
 today we will approach the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.960
 question of spins orbit 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.800
 what is a szpiner beit inspires 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.359
 beit is a kind of spoons 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 consisting of two parts the first 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.220
 part consists of a lot mass 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 making two sons who is enrolled in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.030
 the hook and between the two a skirt the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.750
 second part of theirs and constitute a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.180
 arm that will make that the payment on 2 65 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 centimes is completed by a briefcase 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.800
 this palette in contact with water will 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 turn to run and masters enormously 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.219
 of vibration a little in the same spirit 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 that a spoon the skirt goes too 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.719
 participated in emitting vibrations and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 allow carnivores to concentrate 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.309
 on nantes his attack on the part where 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.100
 is located the house 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 there are different forms of pallets 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.720
 we have this type of pallets which is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 between the floor pallet and the round pallet 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 there are also equipped with Szpiner 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 several pallets 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.159
 here in this case two pallets waves 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 and to the extent that when we love we do not 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.990
 not account Szpiner four pallets 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.030
 here pallets soil we see that they 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.700
 are shaped elongated and not 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.799
 more rounded the more we will have to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 pallets on the szpiner beit more 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.990
 swimming will be planing since the more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 pallets will come to rely on the water 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.079
 at the same time we will have more pallets 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.789
 the more vibrations we will have 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.490
 the use of spin arbeit is a little 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.990
 simpler is the material that I 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.850
 consider that I advise to the whole 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.280
 beginners since it is enough 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 just throw it and bring it back 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.090
 theirs this but automatically prevents 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.369
 however there is another method 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.130
 to fish with a spin of light that 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.149
 actually is to let him down 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.979
 literally we call it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.380
 the helicopter that is to say that to 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.099
 the arrival of the lure on a zone of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.950
 break we will drop the szpiner 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.680
 and who will fall this way if 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.980
 so vertically generating a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.709
 pallet movement which is very 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.099
 very effective on the ashes on the 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.590
 perch 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.660
 the spyder is an excellent time for 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.730
 fishing pike but it is necessary above all 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.269
 the advantage of very very little hang on 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:40.099
 in testing the hook being in the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.290
 same axis as the metal rod the 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.299
 branches and other algae come to type 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.420
 on the branch are never clinging 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.340
 on the hook it's really a weapon 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.170
 formidable to go fishing 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 dead branches the derbier areas in 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.769
 Briefly where any other they do 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.260
 would not pass here now you 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.690
 know how to serve you a szpiner bates who 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.040
 is kind of a bit theirs to 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.910
 do everything but who can save you 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.910
 more than a fishing party
