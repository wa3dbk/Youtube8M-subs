00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
is this side is well the answer is this

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.200 
is this side is well the answer is this
is<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.380> Mac<00:01:11.560> side<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.219> do<00:01:12.310> see<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.700> difference<00:01:12.759> in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
is the Mac side I do see a difference in

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.899 
is the Mac side I do see a difference in
this<00:01:13.420> smoothness<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.350> makeup<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.979> this

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
this smoothness of the makeup and this

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.050 
this smoothness of the makeup and this
is<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.149> bare<00:01:16.359> minerals<00:01:16.859> as<00:01:17.859> it<00:01:18.219> named<00:01:18.430> as<00:01:18.789> its

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
is the bare minerals as it named as its

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
is the bare minerals as it named as its
name<00:01:19.299> entails<00:01:19.719> bare<00:01:20.680> barely<00:01:21.490> there<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.289> so<00:01:23.289> I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
name entails bare barely there and so I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.569 
name entails bare barely there and so I
would<00:01:24.670> say<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.420> Mac<00:01:25.719> is<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.859> better

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
would say that the Mac is a better

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.459 
would say that the Mac is a better
makeup<00:01:27.909> even<00:01:28.539> though<00:01:28.600> it's<00:01:28.810> pretty<00:01:29.170> expensive

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
makeup even though it's pretty expensive

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.849 
makeup even though it's pretty expensive
but<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:31.149> is<00:01:31.179> better<00:01:32.079> if<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.439> want<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.740> have

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
but it is better if you want to have

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.389 
but it is better if you want to have
that<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.719> flawless<00:01:35.020> look<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:36.369> I

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
that more of a flawless look then I

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.459 
that more of a flawless look then I
would<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.939> Mac<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:37.810> if<00:01:38.049> it's<00:01:38.200> just<00:01:38.259> an

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
would say Mac but if it's just an

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.529 
would say Mac but if it's just an
everyday<00:01:38.770> thing<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.429> just<00:01:39.460> running<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.149> the

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
everyday thing like just running to the

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.139 
everyday thing like just running to the
grocery<00:01:41.170> store<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.469> just<00:01:42.280> simple<00:01:42.609> things<00:01:42.640> head

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.800 
to your kids school and you don't want
too<00:01:45.219> much<00:01:45.399> makeup<00:01:45.729> on<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:45.939> would<00:01:46.210> say<00:01:46.240> bare

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
too much makeup on I would say bare

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.590 
too much makeup on I would say bare
minerals<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:48.969> just<00:01:49.060> use<00:01:49.570> a

minerals it is it is it's I just use a
light<00:01:49.929> coat<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:51.159> this<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.579> Barry<00:01:51.789> no<00:01:52.060> side

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
light coat so this is the Barry no side

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
the bare Mac it is a better texture it

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.649 
the bare Mac it is a better texture it
is<00:02:02.140> much<00:02:03.130> smoother<00:02:03.700> makes<00:02:04.359> my<00:02:04.479> eyes<00:02:04.630> look

I tried to L'Oreal True Match it's okay
but<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.780> does<00:02:28.930> give<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:30.030> shiny<00:02:31.030> glossy<00:02:31.359> look

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

and I'd rather look a little matte or a
matte<00:02:36.069> finish<00:02:36.250> instead<00:02:36.579> of<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> shiny

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
matte finish instead of the shiny

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.559 
matte finish instead of the shiny
whatever<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.099> does<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.879> regarding
