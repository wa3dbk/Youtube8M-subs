00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 cooking and fast then today we 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 let's make a Marquise recipe 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.130
 and iced cherries do not worry 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.299
 not there is only the complicated name the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 recipe is super easy 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.410
 it's gone for the recipe of the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 marquise with cherries 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.560
 it will take us 6-2 full 200 g of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.960
 cherries 100 g liquid cream and 300 g 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 of chocolate 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 the recipe is really super easy 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.540
 so in the bowl this game but the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.910
 chocolate with my liquid cream and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 I'm taking it to the microwave for almost 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 almost 50 seconds after washing but 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 cherry 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.230
 I'm going to cut them in half to remove 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.230
 the core 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.989
 so I break my eyes so I know by 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 the whites of the yellows 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:21.730
 and there I go up so white but 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 of egg in snow then at this stage 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.560
 can add a tablespoon of 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 sugar for tight our white the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.900
 chocolate is melted but not too much 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.310
 hot so now I'm going there 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 incorporate some of my plans 2 I 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.430
 Mejean 2 pours and with the whip I 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:54.400
 mix then the first part I the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:02:01.150
 mix energetically years I pour the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:05.009
 remaining of my white t we will mix 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.009
 so delicately 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 so after we can use a maryse 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:18.250
 if it's more convenient for you in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.769
 Now our Antwerp cherries 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.769
 pitted by gently mixing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.890
 but it is to distribute our fruits 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.290
 pretty much everywhere 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.330
 but then I took a mold in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.680
 silicone it will be much easier 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:45.500
 for demolding and I pour all my 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 foam inside I tap mamar 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 that they chase and eventual 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.990
 air bubbles so usually we do 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.490
 the awning molds terrine 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.850
 so me today I wanted to try 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.240
 with a round mold and we'll see what 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.160
 it will give 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.930
 so here I removed the nucleus that is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.120
 happened in the marchioness and now 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.239
 direction the freezer for pretty much 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.150
 two o'clock so I pulled out my marchioness 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.150
 from the freezer then I the molds 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.820
 there I show you the result of close 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.550
 but directly on a plate and we 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.330
 will wait about 10 to 15 minutes 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.989
 before cutting portions I 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.250
 started to cut my dessert compare 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.070
 so do not hesitate to spend your 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.200
 rather under hot water 1 to have 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.200
 more facilities at the level of friends 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.159
 there we see the cherries well we will 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.340
 dispose of it so directly on a 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.340
 plate 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.670
 and there I immediately go to the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.670
 tasting 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.590
 so we have a very good taste of chocolate 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
 iced cherry brings us this little 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.799
 fruity side 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.200
 this dessert is really a marvel 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.480
 that's my iced marchioness recipe 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.770
 with cherries is complete do not hesitate to 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.960

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.150
 you will find the soufflÃ© is ranked 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.730
 raspberry chocolate vanilla ice cream 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.320
 white timbale and chocolate icecream 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.270
 short that recipes is super easy 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.080
