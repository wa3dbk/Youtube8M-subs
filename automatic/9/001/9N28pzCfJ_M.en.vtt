minerals into our stock I'd live
minerals<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.150> bit<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
minerals I think there's a little bit of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
minerals I think there's a little bit of
a<00:01:15.450> myth<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:16.049> take<00:01:16.320> cording<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.189> what

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
a myth that they take cording to what

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
a myth that they take cording to what
they<00:01:17.580> need<00:01:17.820> whereas<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.630> experience<00:01:19.140> they

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they need whereas in my experience they

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890 
they need whereas in my experience they
take<00:01:19.650> minerals<00:01:20.150> according<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.509> feed

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
take minerals according to how much feed

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
take minerals according to how much feed
they've<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.710> front<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.090> many

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
they've got in front of them so so many

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.080 
they've got in front of them so so many
different<00:01:24.810> systems<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.280> many<00:01:26.490> cattle
