00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.750
 well we are in another video with the 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.410
 catracho and today we will see in the title 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.210
 as it says something strange they already noticed it if 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.599
 says no ball 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.050
 well let's see is to be half weird and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.399
 this happened to me playing and well I decided 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.730
 record it I will not lose thank you 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.649
 have the captured and I started to war a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.750
 party to do something that I'm 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.940
 elaborating and good 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.650
 and I get the surprise that I put the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 party and the game is not everything 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.680
 normal 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.250
 it turns out that he started playing and not joining the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.070
 ball and since it goes with this there was no 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.559
 no kind of value is really no no 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.180
 I know what happened but I started to play without 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.400
 ball just did not give me and a half 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.590
 we lost on time but good is one of 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 the errors that occur in fifa I do not know if 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.890
 someone has happened but good to me 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.140
 first time it happens to me 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.200
 I not only wanted to put an error but 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.330
 I played the whole game to see if he can 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.700
 play it like that but good half complicated 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.560
 more as you can see I do not know how 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 I was doing I just knew who 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.550
 I was carrying it there the doorman and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.590
 good isolated and where the pass and I was going 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.440
 going for that reason not for the player like 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 acting and good because the color that the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.740
 they were there tried to make plays and 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.520
 all 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.820
 and if I get this time out of the weird medium 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.539
 but but if it's not two truths it looked 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.990
 ok weird and there they are going to see how he tried 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.170
 try to play well but without the ball 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.479
 it's definitely kind of weird there 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.299
 I sent a center but good past 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.670
 hit the goalkeeper without the ball but 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.790
 the box from there 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.580
 in the out the goalkeeper and good only 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.920
 relax that is without the ball to which no 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.050
 it can be very often this not because it is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 a little funny but it is something 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.580
 funny we will see how long 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.670
 the goal because I do not currently have the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.400
 center and it made me very hard to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 It's true that he's laughing with me 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.490
 friends 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.060
 practicing for the method 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.120
 a goal in the goal that I put 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.430
 and no it was not goal was to lose it is that already 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.830
 neither see nor see the video through 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.870
 count the ball before because I do not know 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.940
 then I was laughing they were going to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.220
 eat talking and was playing not 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.140
 was then my friend told me that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.910
 if there was not if you do not look good 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.340
 ball what a difference it was because well 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.459
 difficult the good thing is that they look good and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.230
 has good good dynamics the ball does not 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.709
 in the game I correct a something 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.739
 important then well I want that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.560
 look as a method the goal so that 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.530
 you realize that there too 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.989
 you look at Glasgow as the goal is 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.060
 shake all that not and well it was not any 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.830
 trick or nothing was really something that 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.870
 He came out doing less do not ask me 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.019
 how he did it because I do not really know 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.540
 I put water and there's no soil with the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.830
 player and good I am the death pass 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.140
 I think I'm not sure 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.960
 I'm really not sure that's how 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.720
 I went to escape death and before the 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.190
 class there is no one who was there 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.860
 I was saying how to do it if you can 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.890
 Death pass and well that was the goal 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.930
 not really something strange and alone does not 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 he waited good he happened to me the grave thing and what 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.370
 I share with you I hope that you 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.950
 like this crime and I think with this 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.230
 is the error detected number two so 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.180
 I hope you like it without a 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370
 mistake number one that was very good 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.840
 I 'm also going to leave it here to appear 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.950
