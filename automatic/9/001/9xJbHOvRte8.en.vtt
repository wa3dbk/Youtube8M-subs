00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hello Natalia purse and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 in today's lesson we will sort out mating 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 parquet which is particularly impressive 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.660
 looks on yarn printer for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 performing that pattern fits any 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.510
 number of loops recruit them any 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.510
 in a way 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.340
 I remove the first edge loop and then 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:04.010
 knit 2 together front with a slope to the left 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.940
 for the rear walls of the first loop we remove 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.050
 knitting needles and the second loop leave and knit 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.690
 further and and 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.140
 and following not loop 2 along with 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.340
 tilt to the left behind the back wall also 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.740
 per 1 remove the loop in the second and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.920
 knit together next to her face with 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.970
 tilt to the left behind the back wall and so 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.970
 further to the end of the row 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:27.480
 at the end we knit 2 together front of the back 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:31.190
 wall 1 loop is removed and the remaining 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.190
 knit loop as edge 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.959
 turn knitting to purl 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:49.689
 the side 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:53.000
 knit purl row edge remove and 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:57.620
 knit 2 together purl first 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 the method further one loop rented 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.890
 and the second and the next do not knit 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.890
 wrong side 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.350
 each time we knit two together 1 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.330
 take off the second and next for not 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.830
 knit two together 1 take off 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.830
 we knit the next one together 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:10.950
 late knotted two together 1 remove and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.330
 the last knit edge 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.330
 knit edging face with 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.670
 on the seamy side we form 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:29.520
 such rows 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:29.520
 the form of a cord on the front side of the rows 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.460
 with slanted eyelets and further facial 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.150
 a series of repeat 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.910
 also knit also remove the face 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:49.040
 edge sorry we take off and on 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:52.050
 knit 2 together front of the back wall 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:59.480
 we remove the first loops and we knit the second 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.480
 next together and so on until the end of the series 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:17.370
 Here is a parquet obtained from the front 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:21.800
 side of the seamy side do you see 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:25.349
 hydrochloric viscous enough and dense handle 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.069
 it is better to perform her knitting on the half-room 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.250
 more than usually choose for this 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.250
 beach
