00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.029
 the hot Scripps 2 offers a charttechnisch not outstanding but 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.120
 harmonious and lively graphics 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.340
 because the differences between Winsen console version in fast motion 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.170
 Itzehoe are used to leisurely stroll through 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.349
 Florence 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.899
 Compared to pc version for the Xbox 3 60 the overall restless picture 

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.819
 due to the lack of anti-aliasing 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.999
 after all, we did not know the same score 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.609
 successfully 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 The cap session by up to eight times smart team is then 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.570
 even the biggest graphic trump of the PC 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.640
 in most other areas the versions are identical 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 Fourth in the textures that are not ugly but rather blurred 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910
 the PC could be much more 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.570
 also both versions in common by the sudden switching between the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.680
 Participants open 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.410
 until a few feet before he reaches the front of the house they are in time 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750
 full of splendor 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.030
 this phenomenon also affects figures and objects 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 In the following scene, watch the sprint in the direction of the cathedral once on its 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260
 Textures as well as to press and passers-by 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 partly quite abruptly at all 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.920
 Here's the same scene at a tempo on the console 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.299
 the wafting lines at the dome are again smoothing out the missing edges 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.299
 owing 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.060
 however, with the strong effects, the BC has its edge this concerns 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.820
 not all kinds of shadows 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.000
 so are on the then in both versions clear pack to see 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.450
 the shadow of this Balko and since then very late its two versions 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 actual border 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.780
 on the PC title, although a little softer there is still sagging on 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.530
 The characters have succeeded best 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 which are shown a little sharper in the pc version 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.399
 above the rooftops of Florence fall in both versions jumping shadows 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.690
 as in the console version of the unrest in the country 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 the quality of lighting and it-systems tours is equivalent 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.559
 why am I not surprised 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.329
 despite the small technical differences between bit 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.409
 console version 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.189
 the candidacy on the toilet zockt nevertheless for a total noticeably higher 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.899
 Image quality everything he has 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.409
