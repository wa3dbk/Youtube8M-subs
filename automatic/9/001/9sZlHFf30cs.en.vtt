00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi, welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.700
 psychiatry quality education for the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 population 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.170
 We are going to talk to Alexandre today. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.660
 She is a psychiatrist and she is 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.089
 doctor of medicine by usp other 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 alexandrina the population has a question 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.810
 which I think is very important that we can 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.580
 cure antidepressant medications them 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.869
 they cause dependency not 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 This question is very important because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.860
 antidepressant does not vitiate addicts 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.219
 comes with the black rate are mostly 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 benzodiazepines 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 antidepressant it improves mood of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.250
 who is giving you who is down to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 who is normal it will not increase the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 value 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 we make a similar comparison with the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.829
 novalgina if I have hyperthermia 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 have a fever and I take a page of my 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 fever will go down but the study 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.430
 normal temperature and I take the dipyrone 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.210
 what happens to my temperature 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.400
 remains the same 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.409
 I can have blood pressure drop 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 which is the side effect 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.840
 so we can have side effects 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.150
 of antidepressants but not change of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 state of humor because it is not a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.030
 euphoric and non-addictive 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 take as directed that your doctor 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 he prescribe 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.810
 this will do a lot of benefit and not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.829
 dependency of the year has rained but 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.650
 does not cause any harm 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.009
 anyone can take an antidepressant 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.140
 do not cause bad you wear no glasses 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.030
 anyone will wear glasses 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.390
 sun when you have only because otherwise 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.240
 we should not use drugs 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.149
 especially without medical advice 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.820
 self medication and sometimes suggestion 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.259
 relatives there are because I 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 I also looked good so I want it too 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.540
 It's good, no, you 're fine, without it. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 medication 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.170
 the medication is just to treat those 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.829
 people who actually need the medicine 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.360
 The less medicine, the better your life. 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.849
 Go be happy 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.670
 if you do not need the medicine and your 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.090
 life will be just as happy if you 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.360
 need the dr 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.970
 8 and take it right we'll be happy 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.849

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.739
 individual need each will have 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.650

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.080
 world but only what we 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.849
