 we are not going to give some phrases from the reactors 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.579

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.429
 only others can say 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.829

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.739
 with that communication problem that is the first 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.919
 i leather 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.269

 we are both the same 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.090
 a captain 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.850
 astronauts 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 minutes before boarding the spacecraft 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.610
 then 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.590
 min 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.180
 but boys 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.589
 in 5 in a minute per minute we will achieve these two short aztec helmets 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.400
 with 111 tight 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.160
 fernando patron everyone has their seats and 32% respect helmet as 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.240
 consequence of all this does not mean this gentleman please this index 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.790
 but he also contacted by phone but you think that you 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.700
 you think 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 the pacific de guinness is less than two tenths 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.420
 I never bought a house 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.390
 it's not first class let's go to the moon is a spaceship is comfortable seat 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.340

 to little more than two decades 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.310
 in addition to these two topics because I do not think it's a bit more space and 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.130
 so that people so tight because the customer and top quality in their 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.729
 fighting helmets 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.330
 in copenhagen it is situated in 1 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 sometimes it can be a little bit for a lot of people just because nobody presses the red button 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.510
 It's worth paying until within 30 seconds we're going to wait 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.139
 before Peru presents 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:24.409
 harry hit the red button once I need please that separates so much because 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.250
 everything can be expected only 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.790
 a good cocktail and a smaller amount I have but I need help 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089

 where I could learn to fly 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.009
 here here is more conscious let's go to the moon 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.519
 the dependencies of san adrián also provides some favor so the hand inside 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.009
 of all the world 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.259
 r 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.319
 the truth is that you know what it is that I understand first ball 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.719
 here here that place 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.989
 the exhibition in power up there was true 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.119
 where can I learn to fly 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.239

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.550

 lawmakers vote to fly patrol photography and design by 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:31.489
 favor

 in this season 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.299
 every time 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.790
 At this time where they can pay I do not think it's the solution to be able 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.449
 enter 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.079
