that is part of what really appeals to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.230 
that is part of what really appeals to
me<00:00:12.950> about<00:00:13.040> Dartmouth<00:00:13.520> Medical<00:00:13.640> School<00:00:14.090> is

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
think that I'm able to focus on making

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.000 
think that I'm able to focus on making
myself<00:00:31.940> a<00:00:32.210> better<00:00:32.239> person<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:33.050> going<00:00:33.739> beyond

just<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.879> academics<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.570> medical<00:00:35.900> school

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
just the academics of medical school

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.479 
just the academics of medical school
because<00:00:36.500> we<00:00:36.710> have<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:36.980> kind<00:00:37.160> of<00:00:37.190> environment

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
because we have that kind of environment

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.549 
because we have that kind of environment
it's<00:00:37.910> supportive<00:00:38.360> I'm<00:00:38.660> an<00:00:38.900> individual<00:00:39.379> they

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
want me to grow to be who I'm going to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.399 
want me to grow to be who I'm going to
be<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.890> not<00:00:43.010> just<00:00:43.309> an<00:00:43.519> automat<00:00:44.330> on<00:00:44.479> of<00:00:44.839> basic

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
be and not just an automat on of basic

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.590 
be and not just an automat on of basic
science<00:00:45.620> information<00:00:46.129> or<00:00:46.729> clinical

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
science information or clinical

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.100 
science information or clinical
diagnosis

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.930 

so<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.140> was<00:00:53.290> able<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.560> do<00:00:53.739> clinical<00:00:54.670> research

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
so I was able to do clinical research

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.070 
so I was able to do clinical research
this<00:00:55.120> summer<00:00:55.329> with<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.720> Department<00:00:56.020> of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
this summer with the Department of

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.380 
this summer with the Department of
Neurosurgery<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.830> I<00:00:57.310> felt<00:00:57.520> like<00:00:57.610> that<00:00:57.790> in<00:00:58.090> and

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
Neurosurgery and I felt like that in and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.610 
Neurosurgery and I felt like that in and
of<00:00:58.450> itself<00:00:58.600> was<00:00:58.989> an<00:00:59.080> incredible<00:00:59.530> learning

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
of itself was an incredible learning

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.560 
of itself was an incredible learning
experience<00:00:59.829> because<00:01:00.309> I<00:01:00.730> essentially<00:01:01.300> became

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
experience because I essentially became

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.970 
experience because I essentially became
the<00:01:01.809> coordinator<00:01:02.230> for<00:01:02.470> this<00:01:02.620> clinical

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
the coordinator for this clinical

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.680 
the coordinator for this clinical
project<00:01:03.129> going<00:01:03.970> on<00:01:04.120> at<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.269> department<00:01:04.660> of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
project going on at the department of

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.950 
project going on at the department of
neurosurgery<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.410> gave<00:01:05.800> me<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:06.010> lot<00:01:06.190> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
neurosurgery and it gave me a lot of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.969 
neurosurgery and it gave me a lot of
confidence<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.320> skills<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.830> going

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
confidence and the skills that I'm going

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.290 
confidence and the skills that I'm going
to<00:01:09.040> need<00:01:09.280> for<00:01:09.640> third<00:01:09.820> year<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.180> they're

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
to need for third year that they're

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.240 
to need for third year that they're
going<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.810> there<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.320> then<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:11.860> at

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
going to be there and then it that at

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.859 
going to be there and then it that at
least<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.670> beginnings<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.390> what<00:01:13.450> I'm<00:01:13.690> going

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
least the beginnings of what I'm going

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.750 
least the beginnings of what I'm going
to<00:01:13.900> need<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.350> grow<00:01:14.530> into<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.400> next<00:01:15.640> few

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
to need to grow into in the next few

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.219 
to need to grow into in the next few
years<00:01:15.820> as<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.210> face<00:01:16.479> challenges<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.110> I've

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
years as I face challenges that I've

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.480 
years as I face challenges that I've
never<00:01:17.470> even<00:01:17.740> imagined<00:01:18.280> before

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.370 

I<00:01:21.549> think<00:01:22.299> Dartmouth<00:01:22.630> Medical<00:01:22.659> School<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.229> an

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
I think Dartmouth Medical School is an

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.950 
I think Dartmouth Medical School is an
incredible<00:01:24.340> place<00:01:24.520> for<00:01:24.759> aspiring<00:01:25.180> leaders<00:01:25.390> to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
incredible place for aspiring leaders to

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.649 
incredible place for aspiring leaders to
come<00:01:26.110> because<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> small<00:01:28.149> environment

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
come because it is a small environment

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.109 
come because it is a small environment
it<00:01:28.899> is<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.140> nurturing<00:01:29.619> environment<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.430> I

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
it is a nurturing environment and I

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.039 
it is a nurturing environment and I
really<00:01:31.930> like<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> comparison<00:01:32.799> of<00:01:34.049> Dartmouth

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
really like the comparison of Dartmouth

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.050 
really like the comparison of Dartmouth
being<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.619> quick<00:01:35.860> skiff<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.520> can<00:01:36.670> change

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
being a quick skiff that can change

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.020 
being a quick skiff that can change
directions<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.680> hear<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.009> comparison<00:01:39.939> that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
directions you hear the comparison that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.359 
directions you hear the comparison that
a<00:01:40.090> lot<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.299> larger<00:01:41.110> schools<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.280> know

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
a lot of larger schools are you know

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.679 
a lot of larger schools are you know
different<00:01:42.580> institutions<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:43.420> see<00:01:43.570> this

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
different institutions and we see this

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.919 
different institutions and we see this
all<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.170> time<00:01:44.320> are<00:01:44.799> these<00:01:45.280> huge<00:01:45.850> cruise<00:01:46.630> ships

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
all the time are these huge cruise ships

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.919 
all the time are these huge cruise ships
that<00:01:47.350> they<00:01:47.409> can't<00:01:47.770> turn<00:01:47.950> fast<00:01:48.280> enough<00:01:48.520> to

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
that they can't turn fast enough to

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.749 
that they can't turn fast enough to
avoid<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:51.630> Titanic<00:01:52.630> Athens<00:01:52.929> icebergs<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
avoid the Titanic Athens icebergs and I

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.889 
avoid the Titanic Athens icebergs and I
think<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.450> nice<00:01:55.600> thing<00:01:55.840> about

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
think that the nice thing about

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.899 
think that the nice thing about
Dartmouth<00:01:56.319> is<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:56.950> very<00:01:57.039> responsive

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
Dartmouth is that it's very responsive

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.969 
Dartmouth is that it's very responsive
and<00:01:58.179> it's<00:01:58.299> it's<00:01:58.600> small<00:01:58.899> enough<00:01:58.929> that<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.799> can
