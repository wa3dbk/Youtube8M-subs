00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 to spend those crazy people here 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.970
 playing English inside one of my 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.259
 favorite maps well it's not that it's my 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.790
 favorite but I have a great time 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 playing here you already know what good by 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 block rate favorites if the maps of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 rage and all those things that you killed a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.929
 Wafer but good, here we are, the truth 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 is that this map does not displease me 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 I like it a lot as I say I have fun 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.619
 very much playing here and nothing are going to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.300
 see how it gives us have made a 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.980
 update blocks now 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.380
 they fill in just see how that is 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.210
 magically they get alone and that's something 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.399
 that I like because always when 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.809
 games became very long this was 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.820
 finished and did without armor 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.230
 respected the ass although the armor of 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.010
 gold do not do too much but hey something is 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.260
 something 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.940
 this is better than nothing and to see the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.890
 comrades have not made any bridges 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
 there is a blue one there that has been done what 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.699
 seen and could have measured with him but 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.050
 I'm late and I have not left with him 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.970
 because if you look, the speed is already 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.129
 because this is the mini and in the min already and 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.620
 medium speed so when 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.170
 I started to go look there we have a 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.059
 little bridge made I go to the speed there 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 we are yes sir we have arrived before 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.129
 them designs and that colleague 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.770
 we're going to throw you crazy pizza we're going to 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.659
 throw 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.609
 constructed 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.609
 people went from difficult it is very bad 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:28.670
 kaka no no no 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:31.290
 but more than a metal I do not want it to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 are doing to my partner and as not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.430
 I want you to want them to sneak into the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.430
 I'm a good defender 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.750
 I'm going to take it by curving so that it opens like this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 It's me 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.790
 and this 999 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.300
 no no no no no no no no no no no no 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.300
 1t escapes if it escapes 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 OK 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.870
 hey joe 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.729
 not happened happened happened it happened quiet 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.920
 this one that thinks I have little life or 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.320
 something is worth nothing has been comfortable playing 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.090
 man please are doing a sky and 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.580
 I do not like that because the sky you know 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.000
 what is the key 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.230
 your pizza pizza that you want from me you what 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.860
 do you want from me 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.180
 do not throw to me that I'm going to kill you 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.120
 I do not have speed it's over I want to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.879
 speed because if the speed is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.150
 complicated to get to the wool you 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.150
 pillan 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.130
 the bad thing now is that they will be born 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.130
 and that's bad but good 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 How do I jump? 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.320
 you have just to see how he jumped over 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.320
 the arrows that throw me 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.970
 and this is going to die because I do not know 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.970
 what he does less seriously 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.890
 this house upstairs 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 does not do that, click two since I do not have 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.670

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.370

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.120

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.510
 there's a bastard in there who is 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.700

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.730

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.370
 nobody is amazing, people are camping 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.370
 there in the wool and everything 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.500
 but we did not pass, I took a wool 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.090
 it seems strange to me that I hate it 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.680
 like the six blocks so I want 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.290

 6 x 9 are not 64 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.280
 very good but I do not know why I had 64 in 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.950
 end nothing happens because I had 10 already 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.030
 before the hand is not seen that either 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.790

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.610

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:43.219
 the base to prove it I'm recording 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.110
