00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a 40-yard dash kind of see how their

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.529 
a 40-yard dash kind of see how their
speed<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.130> there<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.699> second<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> back

peddle drill see how they're moving
obviously<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.619> back<00:00:22.800> peddle<00:00:23.130> their<00:00:23.250> speed

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
obviously on the back peddle their speed

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.890 
obviously on the back peddle their speed
there<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.330> third<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
there as well the third one was a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330 
there as well the third one was a
strength<00:00:25.230> drill<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.650> use<00:00:25.769> push<00:00:26.039> ups<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
strength drill and we use push ups as a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700 
strength drill and we use push ups as a
strength<00:00:26.670> drill<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.470> shoul

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
strength drill so with that we shoul

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259 
strength drill so with that we shoul
rise<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.189> David<00:00:29.460> showing<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> these<00:00:30.029> three

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
rise and David showing you these three

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
rise and David showing you these three
drills<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.170> you're<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> new<00:00:31.470> coach<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
drills and if you're a new coach and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.200 
drills and if you're a new coach and
you're<00:00:32.160> evaluating<00:00:32.460> place<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> very

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you're evaluating place for the very

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
you're evaluating place for the very
first<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> breaks<00:00:34.530> down

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
first time this kind of breaks down

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
first time this kind of breaks down
players<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> away<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.670> their<00:00:35.820> speed

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
players right away with their speed

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
players right away with their speed
their<00:00:36.270> strength<00:00:36.570> where<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.649> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
their strength where they are so we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.729 
their strength where they are so we
think<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:39.020> barometer<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
think it's a very good barometer for you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.770 
think it's a very good barometer for you
to<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:41.910> evaluating<00:00:42.180> place<00:00:42.600> for

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
to use when you're evaluating place for

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.080 
to use when you're evaluating place for
the<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.489> okay<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:44.940> one

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the very first time okay the first one

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
the very first time okay the first one
drill<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> 40-yard<00:00:46.320> dash

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
drill we do is the 40-yard dash

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
drill we do is the 40-yard dash
we<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> together<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
we don't do it together we do it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
we don't do it together we do it
individually<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> guys<00:00:49.559> need<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.829> by

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
individually so you guys need to go by

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.069 
individually so you guys need to go by

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
each person a through so the 40-yard

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
each person a through so the 40-yard
dash<00:00:53.670> give<00:00:54.300> us<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.570> idea<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:54.960> fast<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.559> kid<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
dash give us an idea how fast the kid is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.990 
dash give us an idea how fast the kid is
I'll<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.430> whistle

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I'll do it on my whistle

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
I'll do it on my whistle
go<00:00:57.719> ahead<00:00:57.840> damnit<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:59.039> obviously<00:00:59.100> we

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
go ahead damnit and well obviously we

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
go ahead damnit and well obviously we
have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> clock<00:00:59.760> someone<00:01:00.149> timing<00:01:00.629> them<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
have a clock someone timing them and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
have a clock someone timing them and
this<00:01:01.469> gives<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> kid<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> work

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this gives a kid something to work

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.590

towards<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.000> faster<00:01:03.329> during<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
towards to to get faster during the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.939 
towards to to get faster during the
season<00:01:03.960> second<00:01:04.320> guys<00:01:04.409> riles

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
season second guys riles

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.000 
season second guys riles
were<00:01:05.850> trials<00:01:06.240> he's<00:01:06.840> running<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.350> we're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
were trials he's running down we're

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
were trials he's running down we're
timing<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.780> what

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
timing them right there and that's what

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.910 
timing them right there and that's what
we're<00:01:10.049> doing<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> speed

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
we're doing that's one of the speed

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
we're doing that's one of the speed
evaluations<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.240> break<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> kid

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
