00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
got 350 brake horsepower oh yes because

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.000 
got 350 brake horsepower oh yes because
we<00:02:43.010> actually<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.460> twin<00:02:43.880> turbo<00:02:44.690> lot<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.740> power

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010
