00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.290
 yes 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.450
 [Music] 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.920
 and we will be able to do the round the world 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.450
 a tutorial of the ones that you are most of 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.130
 watching lately maybe the most requested 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.570
 it's worth many your comments 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.920
 in the last videos saying please 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.360
 forward is going to make the return to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.710
 my brother world to learn to do the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.060
 around the world and today we are going to learn to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.560
 do it both outside and inside 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.150
 even with the left leg with a 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.710
 I'll give you a little trick here 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.420
 it's worth something very important that you have to 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 click before watching this video and it's 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.690
 how to dominate the ball how right it is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.580
 perfect for party on the line that is 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.720
 very very important that before moving on to 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.490
 make the round the world let's start with 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.900
 make the perfect touches that always 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.250
 we rise to the same height as him 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.259
 give with the tip of the foot as if 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.520
 follow that video so watch this and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.080
 then we went around the world 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.490
 to finish we are going to finish step for 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.290
 being able to make the return to the world is worth very 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.869
 important what I have told you to master the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.970
 ball voucher authorized three touches 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.160
 you always try to burn it in upload to the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.650
 same height and especially what leaves you 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.000
 a leading edge is the man of passage 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.740
 very important then we have to decide 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 before giving the touch if you want 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.800
 do them inwards do not go up doing it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.300
 outside 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.890
 good kids here a recommendation 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.310
 before leaving, I remember I was doing 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.310
 a lot of movement 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.409
 movement this or that there's a lot 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.600
 movement of this ballet is important 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.549
 heat before because it pulls a lot of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.259
 back and then the hairs 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.850
 you do this movement a lot and then 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.439
 take a little easier to be worth is a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 foolish but good I'm not going practice 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.350
 this way now we have to decide 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.460
 then do the tapping so that what 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.259
 we want to go around the world if not 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.270
 you want to do outside, so that is 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.860
 to do in it is important that he 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.030
 pull accompanying ball is worth the movement 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.310
 of the one that accompanies you the ball is to say is 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 the ball is going to turn to this side or if 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 is going to turn to this side like now 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.110
 a move out and then my 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.730
 recommendation is in many touches because 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.200
 many touches come out and already in the moment 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.530
 that you want to pass over 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.019
 you simply do like this you do 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.390
 well or so diagonally totally in 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.310
 diagonal and that's when the ball stops 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.989
 make that turn that I have told you and yours 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 life has to go over it would be 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.650
 something like that I wanted to do it towards 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.200
 inside he had something like that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.970
 [Applause] 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.170
 well then and then you see the ball almost 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.450
 has not rotated because it also depends on 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 the strength that we give him with our foot or 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 that once you master the freestyle 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.189
 it's much better that the ball does not arrive 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.140
 to play at all so that he can 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.090
 example in the mirror when the green 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.000
 offers for example I'm going to combine the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.490
 two to zero so 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.080
 so take them or combine multiple 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.090
 as you have seen the examples of before 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.490
 so it's just going to go with the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.580
 foot a foot movement accompany him 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.950
 with the ball with the right moment 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.200
 It is also important as you see here 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.880
 they took it to a very high height 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.620
 here you can have hip height 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.030
 it simply has to be that it's at 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.790
 height of the touches and have a moment 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.550
 you have the highest 61 touches worth 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.590
 you walk up or that the kids and 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.240
 I want to do it like I said before 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.760
 it would be something like what would be less 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.040
 now he would not be right-handed with the left 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 like me 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 [Music] 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.940
 It's worth as you can see it's a little jump 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.630
 right and at the moment that we the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.630
 we throw up 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.800
 accompanies jumping that both legs 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.910
 you have to have a little bit of feet but 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.230
 it's also a little better something like that 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.000
 [Applause] 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.159
 and we caught her doing it with the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.849
 contrary or if you have a lot of flexibility 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:05.569
 and a lot of flexibility 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.569
 so it's a little bit 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.120
 You see, you have to have a lot of speed 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.560
 of legs and would be let go and as soon as 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.000
 to the rotation the air we will also pass 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.299
 to super fast re-apply that already 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.380
 is learning to lift your leg a lot 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.820
 doing many stretches and good 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.620
 I think it's something that also remains very 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.060
 nice for right-handed or left-handed people 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.830
 do it right so an ax 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.930
 balentien recommendation is worth deis 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.400
 many many many touches and once 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.810
 do that simply in trespassing the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.910
 front leg one on one side for the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.530
 another one is valid and it is already that I algaba not 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.790
 it has a lot of mystery there is no trick 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.500
 to do it nor is there anything you say 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.960
 doing that back Felix second 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.340
 simply practice dynamics 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.870
 so the kid I hope you have 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.949
 liked this tutorial I hope you can 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.150
 feed the jce button what am I 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.639
 saying a lot I think that good 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.930
 having explain as easy as possible 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.190
 it's just that you see a 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.810
 little the movement that is imitating 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.830
 You can also learn what you have for 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.780

 little bit more so nothing next 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.020
 others that I wanted to leave them on the list of
