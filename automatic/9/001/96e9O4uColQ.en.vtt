they've<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.630> resorted<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.409> pallets<00:02:06.860> for

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
they've just resorted to the pallets for

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.430 
they've just resorted to the pallets for
the<00:02:07.220> most<00:02:07.430> part<00:02:07.729> now<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.299> album<00:02:08.869> isn't<00:02:09.259> all

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the most part now the album isn't all

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
the most part now the album isn't all
ballads<00:02:10.099> that's<00:02:10.310> not<00:02:10.519> what<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:10.759> saying<00:02:10.789> but

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
ballads that's not what I'm saying but

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.199 
ballads that's not what I'm saying but
it's<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.620> there's<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.520> many<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:14.000> them

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
it's just that there's so many of them

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.630 
it's just that there's so many of them
maybe<00:02:14.510> not<00:02:14.630> necessarily<00:02:14.959> ballads<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.100> slower

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
maybe not necessarily ballads but slower

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.610 
maybe not necessarily ballads but slower
songs

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
songs

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.710 
songs
just<00:02:17.799> don't<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.400> build<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:18.819> into<00:02:19.239> anything

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
just don't really build up into anything

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.800 
just don't really build up into anything
all<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.319> these<00:02:20.650> sounds<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.299> make

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
all of these sounds just kind of make

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930 
all of these sounds just kind of make
for<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> most<00:02:23.379> uninteresting<00:02:24.129> killer's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
for the most uninteresting killer's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.500 
for the most uninteresting killer's
album<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.750> date<00:02:25.989> which<00:02:26.409> is<00:02:27.510> surprising

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
album to date which is surprising

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
album to date which is surprising
considering<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.319> few<00:02:29.530> months<00:02:29.830> ago<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.489> band

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
considering a few months ago the band

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
considering a few months ago the band
was<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.390> talking<00:02:32.080> about<00:02:32.290> their<00:02:32.620> upcoming

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
was in talking about their upcoming

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.160 
was in talking about their upcoming
studio<00:02:33.400> album<00:02:33.519> we're<00:02:34.150> saying<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.750> expect

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
studio album we're saying to expect

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.190 
studio album we're saying to expect
bigger<00:02:35.860> guitars<00:02:36.400> bigger<00:02:36.970> sounds<00:02:37.629> in<00:02:37.750> general

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
bigger guitars bigger sounds in general

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.140 
bigger guitars bigger sounds in general
and<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:38.620> not<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.159> we<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:39.549> on<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:39.940> album

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and that's not what we got on this album

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.180 
and that's not what we got on this album
I<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.599> think<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.930> mean<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.409> hear<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
I don't think I mean I can hear the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.970 
I don't think I mean I can hear the
massive<00:02:42.670> courses<00:02:43.239> at<00:02:43.569> times<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.409> some<00:02:44.709> songs

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
massive courses at times on some songs

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.600 
massive courses at times on some songs
and<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:46.120> loud<00:02:46.329> crashing<00:02:47.049> guitars<00:02:47.470> at<00:02:47.799> times

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and the loud crashing guitars at times

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.170 
and the loud crashing guitars at times
but<00:02:49.209> not<00:02:50.079> as<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> whole<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.220> whole<00:02:51.640> album

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
but not as a whole on the whole album

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.479 
but not as a whole on the whole album
the<00:02:52.450> lyrics<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.230> album<00:02:53.260> feel<00:02:53.890> uninspired

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the lyrics on the album feel uninspired

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.360 
the lyrics on the album feel uninspired
at<00:02:55.480> times<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.140> like<00:02:56.290> I've<00:02:56.709> heard<00:02:57.099> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
at times and just like I've heard this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.150 
at times and just like I've heard this
in<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.879> killer<00:02:58.120> song<00:02:58.540> before<00:02:58.810> almost<00:02:59.650> you<00:03:00.040> know

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
in a killer song before almost you know

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160 
in a killer song before almost you know
or<00:03:00.340> maybe<00:03:00.579> at<00:03:00.760> least<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.180> Brandon<00:03:01.989> Flowers

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
or maybe at least and Brandon Flowers

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.880 
or maybe at least and Brandon Flowers
solo<00:03:03.099> album<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.109> they're<00:03:05.109> not<00:03:05.290> really<00:03:05.620> that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
solo album and they're not really that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.660 
solo album and they're not really that
anything<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.109> original<00:03:08.109> or<00:03:08.670> revolutionary

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
anything that original or revolutionary

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.000 
anything that original or revolutionary
and<00:03:10.120> none<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.840> them<00:03:11.019> are<00:03:11.170> songs<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.739> like

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
and none of them are songs that I like

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.240 
and none of them are songs that I like
as<00:03:12.220> much<00:03:12.250> as<00:03:12.489> songs<00:03:13.209> on<00:03:13.510> previous<00:03:14.200> albums<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
as much as songs on previous albums the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.830 
as much as songs on previous albums the
band<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.670> used<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.090> have<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.480> much<00:03:16.629> more

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
band just used to have so much more

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960 
band just used to have so much more
passion<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.560> fire<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.129> their<00:03:18.310> music<00:03:18.459> back<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
passion and fire to their music back in

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.420 
passion and fire to their music back in
the<00:03:19.060> Hot<00:03:19.269> Fuss<00:03:19.569> days<00:03:19.900> whereas<00:03:20.440> now<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:21.370> just

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the Hot Fuss days whereas now it just

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.610 
the Hot Fuss days whereas now it just
doesn't<00:03:21.700> feel<00:03:22.180> like<00:03:22.239> there's<00:03:23.169> that<00:03:23.410> much

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
doesn't feel like there's that much

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.300 
doesn't feel like there's that much
energy<00:03:24.609> there<00:03:25.060> or<00:03:25.329> passion<00:03:26.260> behind<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.950> music

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
energy there or passion behind the music

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.830 
energy there or passion behind the music
and<00:03:27.459> that's<00:03:27.549> what<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.790> really<00:03:28.209> miss<00:03:28.389> about<00:03:28.720> The

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and that's what I really miss about The

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.780 
and that's what I really miss about The
Killers<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.709> have<00:03:30.099> some<00:03:30.340> favorites

Killers now I do have some favorites
from<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.299> album<00:03:31.690> they're<00:03:32.349> not<00:03:32.560> all-time

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
from the album they're not all-time

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
this is the best song the killers have

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.300 
this is the best song the killers have
ever<00:03:36.280> done<00:03:36.639> but<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.629> do<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:38.260> my<00:03:38.290> favorites<00:03:38.950> the

band<00:03:39.549> succeeds<00:03:40.150> more<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.810> album<00:03:41.019> when

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
band succeeds more on this album when

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.619 
band succeeds more on this album when
they<00:03:41.379> really<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:42.160> for<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> bigger<00:03:42.730> sound<00:03:43.120> in

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
they really go for the bigger sound in

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.110 
they really go for the bigger sound in
the<00:03:43.870> more<00:03:44.200> massive<00:03:44.470> courses<00:03:45.280> than<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.790> slower

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the more massive courses than the slower

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.750 
the more massive courses than the slower
paced<00:03:46.510> ballads<00:03:47.169> my<00:03:47.829> favorites<00:03:48.280> start<00:03:48.609> off

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
paced ballads my favorites start off

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.479 
paced ballads my favorites start off
with<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> single<00:03:49.389> Runaways<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.160> released

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
with the single Runaways it was released

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.470 
with the single Runaways it was released
back<00:03:51.819> in<00:03:52.060> July<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.780> still<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:54.699> does<00:03:54.970> hold<00:03:55.269> up

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
back in July and still this does hold up

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.080 
back in July and still this does hold up
and<00:03:55.930> The<00:03:56.199> Killers<00:03:56.500> catalog<00:03:56.949> is<00:03:57.280> probably<00:03:57.879> one

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and The Killers catalog is probably one

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.720 
and The Killers catalog is probably one
of<00:03:58.180> their<00:03:58.299> best<00:03:58.560> singles<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.799> while<00:04:00.040> but

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
of their best singles in a while but
