00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.220
 repos everything else i mean it too 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.920
 why can't you say anything about it but 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.110
 the question of how they spent this case all the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 there is already now on this topic will be all 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.849
 the internet will be youtube here I am not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.009
 exception i will say my opinion that is i 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.709
 I think that this competition was also 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.399
 held in violation of the rules yes 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:11.819
 that is what I want to say that is yesterday 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.410
 at 9 pm there was a contest itself that is 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.390
 summed up the whole 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.050
 and rindaman jumped accordingly 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.720
 page boy 1 carino which 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.790
 accordingly did everything done all 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.770
 terms of the competition then I did a repost and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.270
 when summed up its that is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 respectively passed on his page 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.170
 but there insofar as it was very 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480
 many different all sorts of records that is a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.940
 page was 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.220
 well let's say so filled up with different 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.280
 repost contests including that is 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.000
 the organizers of this competition could not 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.040
 find the repost that they needed 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.750
 and the type jumped off this page and became 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.510
 in a new way to play yes that is boy 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.310
 young there is 15 years old in general he is by the idea 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.959
 as for me, yes, he is real 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.959
 the winner is because here everything is obvious 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.549
 and if arrange to eliminate 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 the organizers of this competition are not like 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.090
 would not have come to him on the page that is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.819
 it says he did repost 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.349
 that is, on the list of all these people who 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.120
 did repost and they were in so 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.980
 called the count yes that is they to him 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.500
 crossed means repost by definition was 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.879
 made here my report did not like it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.609
 that is, I think this is basic 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.220
 major violation further they mean 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.000
 went to another page yes there girl 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.590
 one in my opinion with quays and but 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.480
 it is almost a blank page 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.060
 that is, I can't say it was 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.609
 fake pages there we are still some yes 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.290
 Well, definitely I think that the winner 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.639
 need to be considered Karina that is, he won 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.380
 bq the second question is there how she needs him 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.060
 there is no need well I think that the main 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.160
 the first prize was to take karen 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.530
 write in the comments your opinion 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.930
 its kind of attitude towards this because 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.239
 I think that well, how should we 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.709
 still bring to the owners and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.000
 founders so let's say public and jam 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.889
 the fact that in general the competition was well, we will hold with 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.750
 violations not by the rules yes i mean i 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.459
 I think that it was necessary here after all 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.090
 I give this main prize to Karina 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.039
 leave well, like a page on Karin 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.019
 date come see actually i 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:22.160
 I think that he won and he won 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.720
 bmw and here i think that this is also so 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.240
 leave can not be thought that it would be 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.220
 the right decision if we do everything 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.630
 let's write and do it right 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.580
 maximum repost saw it so that 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.580
 people knew that to hold a competition 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.780
 but
