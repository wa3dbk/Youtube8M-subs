00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.759

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:16.330
 and send a lot of luck 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.040
 so I sent that out now as 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.690
 you can go back to your credits 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.890
 I better lower my micro 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.599

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.519
 better I do not know 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.769
 so goes on account excerpts arises that 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:40.110
 here too , it goes without saying 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.110
 I would not have done anything wrong 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.080

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.250
 Dad was 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:18.049
 Reply headline I think the team 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.049
 very well 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.660
 I'll spelled correctly but 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.660
 I do not give a shit 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:04:00.870
 but sent so now at the connection 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.400
 laboratory are then has him up want 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.400
 but get hold of these loans 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.650
 credits the servers do not buy now 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.000
 free available it would have to stop 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.700
 save a bit like I have now 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.840
 even as today it starts from that 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.410
 it does not matter you can too 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.190
 In addition, support with the administrator went 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.070
 that means you can identify there with one 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.980
 10 euro paysafecard one hundred thousand 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.910
 buy credits or with a 5 eur 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.490
 50,000 I believe but he only takes 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.950
 paysafecard and alone or will be like 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.510
 that also means paysafe and paylife 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.160
 palin knows here and I even know 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.270
 not if it gives him why is that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.100
 so 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.710
 and he only accepts that and if you 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
 a paysafecard then gets her 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.600
 for example, to transmit this source 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.230
 so you can minecraft your own 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.550
 create server 24/7 open is her 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.960
 must here save just a bit when 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.390
 you do not want to spend any money on it 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.150
 takes a bit but achievable 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.940
 it started one day ago 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.550
 from a few minutes and already have 500 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.620
 credits i mean so far it is not 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.500
 I would say more up to 30,000 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.300
 Therefore , a few friends 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.810
 Invite the private messages 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.700
 send 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.020
 for private messages gets the 20 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 points for a contribution of 50 credits and 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.810
 for your own theme of you 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.570
 you've got 300 here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.040
 credits and you just have to take care of that 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.530
 she was no nonsense in there writes 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.210
 if any nonsense writes then 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.370
 are you the credit immediately 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.460
 deducted and you get a point if 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.680
 we'll have ten points for 72 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.940
 locked for hours 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.440
 and if you build shit again 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.210
 you will be erased and all of you 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.640
 credits away and new server too 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.440
 number social welfare be careful though 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.440
 use this site and have fun 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.830
