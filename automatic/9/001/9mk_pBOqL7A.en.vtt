00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
video with my review to it Michael was a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.310 
video with my review to it Michael was a
355<00:00:48.830> also<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.670> guess<00:00:49.940> that's<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.629> only<00:00:50.690> color

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
355 also I guess that's the only color

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.810 
355 also I guess that's the only color
for<00:00:52.159> us<00:00:52.339> sisters<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:53.030> color<00:00:53.299> so<00:00:53.720> you<00:00:54.199> know<00:00:54.820> we

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
for us sisters of color so you know we

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.240 
for us sisters of color so you know we
all<00:00:55.970> end<00:00:56.299> up<00:00:56.420> getting<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.780> same<00:00:57.019> shade<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:58.129> it

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
all end up getting the same shade but it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.420 
all end up getting the same shade but it
seems<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.670> work<00:00:58.909> for<00:00:59.180> me<00:00:59.330> also<00:00:59.540> so<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.170> guess<00:01:00.589> it

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
seems to work for me also so I guess it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.570 
seems to work for me also so I guess it
blends<00:01:01.879> into<00:01:02.239> your<00:01:02.690> skin<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.320> evens<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.430> out

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
blends into your skin and evens it out

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.420 
blends into your skin and evens it out
no<00:01:04.909> matter<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.540> know<00:01:05.570> no<00:01:06.350> matter<00:01:06.530> how<00:01:06.860> dark<00:01:07.220> a
