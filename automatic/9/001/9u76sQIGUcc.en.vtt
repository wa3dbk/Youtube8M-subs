Call of Duty ghosts those of you that
are<00:00:13.799> unfamiliar<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> actually

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
are unfamiliar with how you actually

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400 
are unfamiliar with how you actually
earn<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.480> all<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
earn these all you have to do is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.900 
earn these all you have to do is
complete<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.710> fueled<00:00:17.070> order<00:00:17.310> call<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> your

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
complete a fueled order call in your

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370 
complete a fueled order call in your
care<00:00:18.060> package<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:19.050> might<00:00:19.230> get

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
care package and you just might get

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
care package and you just might get
lucky<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.800> get<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> these<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:21.000> keep<00:00:21.180> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
lucky and get one of these but keep in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
lucky and get one of these but keep in
mind<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.660> only<00:00:21.930> works<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.260> certain<00:00:22.320> Maps<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
mind it only works on certain Maps and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.470 
mind it only works on certain Maps and
each<00:00:23.430> map<00:00:23.670> has<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> slightly<00:00:24.300> different

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
each map has a slightly different

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
each map has a slightly different
variation<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.350> their<00:00:25.500> own<00:00:25.650> secret<00:00:26.130> streak

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
variation to their own secret streak

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.820 
variation to their own secret streak
from<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.390> personal<00:00:27.779> experience<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> seems<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
from my personal experience it seems to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
from my personal experience it seems to
be<00:00:28.920> about<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> three<00:00:29.880> chance<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.359> earn

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
be about a one in three chance to earn

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
be about a one in three chance to earn
one<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.900> score<00:00:31.170> streaks<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> given

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
one of these score streaks on the given

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.069 
one of these score streaks on the given
map<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> pretty<00:00:33.690> good<00:00:33.899> chance

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
map so you do have a pretty good chance

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
map so you do have a pretty good chance
of<00:00:34.230> earning<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.730> all<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.000> starting<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of earning that all right so starting it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
of earning that all right so starting it
off<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> map<00:00:37.110> siege<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:38.040> this

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
off we have the map siege and on this

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
off we have the map siege and on this
map<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.030> earn<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.390> missile

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
map you can actually earn a missile

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.869 
map you can actually earn a missile
strike<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.850> basically

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
strike and what this is is basically

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
strike and what this is is basically
just<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.660> few<00:00:42.840> rockets<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> launch<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
just a few rockets that launch up in the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
just a few rockets that launch up in the
air<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.700> target<00:00:45.210> individual<00:00:45.750> enemies<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
air they target individual enemies and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
air they target individual enemies and
then<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.950> rock<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.940> try<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
then they just rock it down and try and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
then they just rock it down and try and
kill<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> enemies<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.829> easily<00:00:50.340> avoided

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
kill the enemies they are easily avoided

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
kill the enemies they are easily avoided
if<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:51.870> gets<00:00:52.140> called<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> against

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
if one of these gets called in against

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
if one of these gets called in against
you<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.670> inside<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> you'll<00:00:54.600> likely

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you just get inside and you'll likely

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
you just get inside and you'll likely
survive<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.829> caught<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
survive if you get caught out in the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
survive if you get caught out in the
open<00:00:56.370> though<00:00:56.730> you'll<00:00:56.969> probably<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.690> killed

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
open though you'll probably get killed

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
open though you'll probably get killed
by<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.460> moving<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> next<00:00:59.969> map<00:01:00.120> we're

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
by it moving on to the next map we're

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
by it moving on to the next map we're
going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> cover<00:01:00.690> strike<00:01:01.050> zone<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.800> sure

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
going to cover strike zone and I'm sure

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
going to cover strike zone and I'm sure
most<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> already<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.510> but

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
most of you already know about this but

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
most of you already know about this but
you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.229> earn<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> Kem<00:01:04.860> strike<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> care

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you can earn a Kem strike and a care

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.399 
you can earn a Kem strike and a care
package<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.119> strike<00:01:06.600> zone<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
package on strike zone and that is the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
package on strike zone and that is the
secret<00:01:07.680> streak<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.369> map<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.600> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
secret streak for this map for those of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.760 
secret streak for this map for those of
you<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> kem<00:01:10.650> strike

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you that don't know what the kem strike

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
you that don't know what the kem strike
does<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.580> does<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:11.970> kills<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> entire

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
does all it does is it kills the entire

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
does all it does is it kills the entire
enemy<00:01:12.990> team<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:14.040> changes<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
enemy team and it also changes the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
enemy team and it also changes the
entire<00:01:15.119> layout<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> map<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
entire layout and look of the map it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
entire layout and look of the map it
plays<00:01:17.130> completely<00:01:17.700> differently<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
plays completely differently and it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.969 
plays completely differently and it
looks<00:01:18.930> quite<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.380> different<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.799> well

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
looks quite a bit different as well

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
looks quite a bit different as well
after<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> Kem<00:01:20.640> strike<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.030> called<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
after the Kem strike is called in and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
after the Kem strike is called in and
keep<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.259> mind<00:01:22.470> strike<00:01:22.740> zone<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> only<00:01:23.369> map

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
keep in mind strike zone is the only map

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
keep in mind strike zone is the only map
that<00:01:23.939> gets<00:01:24.090> changed<00:01:24.479> by<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> Kem<00:01:24.869> strike<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that gets changed by a Kem strike so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
that gets changed by a Kem strike so
next<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.400> war<00:01:26.729> hawk<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
next up we have war hawk and for this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960 
next up we have war hawk and for this
one<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> secret<00:01:28.710> streak<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.430> mortar<00:01:29.729> fire

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
one the secret streak is the mortar fire

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
one the secret streak is the mortar fire
and<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.350> exactly<00:01:31.770> how<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and what this is is exactly how it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
and what this is is exactly how it
sounds<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.090> bunch<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> mortars<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> get

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
sounds it's a bunch of mortars that get

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
sounds it's a bunch of mortars that get
launched<00:01:34.470> onto<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> map<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.250> seem<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> hit

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
launched onto the map they seem to hit

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
launched onto the map they seem to hit
in<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.329> random<00:01:36.720> locations<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.590> they

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
in really random locations and they

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
in really random locations and they
cover<00:01:38.100> pretty<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> entire<00:01:39.060> map<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
cover pretty much the entire map so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
cover pretty much the entire map so
you're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.860> inside<00:01:41.159> if

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you're going to want to get inside if

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
you're going to want to get inside if
this<00:01:41.610> gets<00:01:41.820> called<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.180> against<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.810> if

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this gets called in against you or if

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.300 
this gets called in against you or if
you're<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.710> calling<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you're the one that's calling it in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
you're the one that's calling it in
because<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.939> kill<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.570> well

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
because it will kill you as well

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.510 
because it will kill you as well
but<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.409> won't<00:01:46.530> kill<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.890> teammates<00:01:47.009> unless

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but it won't kill your teammates unless

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520 
but it won't kill your teammates unless
you're<00:01:47.670> playing<00:01:47.820> hardcore<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:49.229> strike

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you're playing hardcore this strike

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
you're playing hardcore this strike
seems<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> last<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.460> 30<00:01:50.909> seconds<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
seems to last for about 30 seconds so

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
seems to last for about 30 seconds so
make<00:01:51.869> sure<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.079> stay<00:01:52.259> inside<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.770> entire

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
make sure you stay inside the entire

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
make sure you stay inside the entire
time<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:54.240> poke<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.570> head<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
time don't poke your head out if you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
time don't poke your head out if you
think<00:01:55.500> maybe<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.250> area<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.880> already<00:01:57.060> been

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
think maybe this area has already been

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.399 
think maybe this area has already been
hit<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.200> hit<00:01:58.380> again

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
hit so it's not going to get hit again

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
hit so it's not going to get hit again
because<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> may<00:01:59.219> hit<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> same<00:01:59.820> spot

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
because it may hit in the same spot

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
because it may hit in the same spot
twice<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> next<00:02:01.860> map<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
twice so the next map we're going to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
twice so the next map we're going to
look<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> whiteout<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
look at is whiteout and for this one you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.830 
look at is whiteout and for this one you
actually<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> satellite<00:02:05.340> crash<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.969> what

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
actually have a satellite crash and what

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually have a satellite crash and what
this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.829> big<00:02:08.160> satellite<00:02:08.429> comes<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
this is is a big satellite comes in and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
this is is a big satellite comes in and
it<00:02:09.509> basically<00:02:09.869> destroys<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.530> entire<00:02:10.920> area

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it basically destroys this entire area

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.860 
it basically destroys this entire area
of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.489> map<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> it'll<00:02:12.209> kill<00:02:12.390> anything<00:02:12.569> in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
of the map and it'll kill anything in

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
of the map and it'll kill anything in
its<00:02:12.959> path

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
its path

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
its path
and<00:02:13.709> once<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.670> landed<00:02:15.060> it'll<00:02:15.299> actually<00:02:15.450> have

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and once it's landed it'll actually have

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.839 
and once it's landed it'll actually have
an<00:02:15.840> EMP<00:02:16.290> effect<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> rest<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> game

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
an EMP effect for the rest of the game

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.420 
an EMP effect for the rest of the game
as<00:02:18.030> far<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> could<00:02:18.480> tell<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.980> EMP

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
as far as I could tell and this EMP

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.680 
as far as I could tell and this EMP
effect<00:02:20.730> basically<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.299> makes<00:02:21.480> your

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
effect basically just makes your

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
effect basically just makes your
heads-up<00:02:22.080> display<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.650> fuzzy<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.250> you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
heads-up display really fuzzy so you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.440 
heads-up display really fuzzy so you
won't<00:02:23.519> really<00:02:23.819> be<00:02:23.909> able<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.330> your

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
won't really be able to see your

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.630 
won't really be able to see your
mini-map<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:24.989> anything<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:26.340> should<00:02:26.489> also

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
mini-map or anything and I should also

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
mini-map or anything and I should also
point<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.299> EMP<00:02:27.720> effect<00:02:28.019> only

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
point out that this EMP effect only

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.619 
point out that this EMP effect only
covers<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.010> certain<00:02:29.430> area<00:02:29.610> around<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.299> actual

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
covers a certain area around the actual

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.660 
covers a certain area around the actual
crash<00:02:30.870> site<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:32.069> doesn't<00:02:32.310> actually<00:02:32.519> cover

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
crash site and it doesn't actually cover

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.550 
crash site and it doesn't actually cover
the<00:02:32.819> entire<00:02:33.060> map<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.200> think<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.409> was<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the entire map and I think it was a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
the entire map and I think it was a
really<00:02:34.739> cool<00:02:34.980> addition<00:02:35.489> but<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.030> am<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
really cool addition but I am a little

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.180 
really cool addition but I am a little
disappointed<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.440> area<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> map

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
disappointed with the area of the map

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
disappointed with the area of the map
that<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> actually<00:02:38.610> hits<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> pretty

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that it actually hits this is a pretty

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.170 
that it actually hits this is a pretty
remote<00:02:40.140> area<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.620> doesn't<00:02:41.400> often<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> lot

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
remote area that doesn't often get a lot

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.759 
remote area that doesn't often get a lot
of<00:02:42.420> people<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.019> lot<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.200> traffic<00:02:43.620> through

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
of people and a lot of traffic through

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.890 
of people and a lot of traffic through
here<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.940> not<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.390> all<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> useful

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
here so it's not really all that useful

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.420 
here so it's not really all that useful
you<00:02:46.200> might<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> kill<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.340> you're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
you might get a kill with it if you're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.420 
you might get a kill with it if you're
lucky<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.140> then<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.349> EMP<00:02:49.769> effect<00:02:50.250> it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
lucky and then the EMP effect it's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.770 
lucky and then the EMP effect it's
probably<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.819> going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> affect<00:02:51.359> many<00:02:51.540> people

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
probably not going to affect many people

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
get onto the catwalk and it also creates

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.539 
get onto the catwalk and it also creates
a<00:03:19.079> big<00:03:19.260> chain<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> explosions<00:03:20.160> throughout<00:03:20.310> the

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
a big chain of explosions throughout the

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.069 
a big chain of explosions throughout the

entire center of the map that will kill

entire center of the map that will kill
any<00:03:22.230> enemies<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.040> area<00:03:23.730> now<00:03:24.480> after<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
any enemies in that area now after the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.569 
any enemies in that area now after the
initial<00:03:25.290> effect<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.799> strike<00:03:26.069> there<00:03:26.430> is

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
initial effect of the strike there is

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.520 
initial effect of the strike there is
also<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.970> fogging<00:03:27.540> effect<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.049> lasts<00:03:28.380> for

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
also a fogging effect that lasts for

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.920 
also a fogging effect that lasts for
about<00:03:28.620> 45<00:03:29.220> seconds<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.910> what<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.569> does<00:03:30.720> is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
about 45 seconds and what this does is

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.360 
about 45 seconds and what this does is
it<00:03:31.019> basically<00:03:31.319> just<00:03:31.410> cuts<00:03:31.739> off<00:03:31.859> all<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:32.280> your

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
it basically just cuts off all of your

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.770 
it basically just cuts off all of your
longer<00:03:32.579> lines<00:03:32.879> of<00:03:33.060> sight<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.419> won't<00:03:33.599> be<00:03:33.690> able

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
longer lines of sight you won't be able

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.869 
longer lines of sight you won't be able
to<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.049> across<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.530> map<00:03:34.709> anymore<00:03:34.889> and<00:03:35.310> it

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
to see across the map anymore and it

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.190 
to see across the map anymore and it
allows<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.299> rush<00:03:36.450> around<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.870> little<00:03:36.989> bit

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
allows you to rush around a little bit

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.020 
allows you to rush around a little bit
more<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.650> really<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.400> up<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.639> your<00:03:38.669> enemies

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030
