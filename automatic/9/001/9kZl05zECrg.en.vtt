the best system to use that I found is

the best system to use that I found is
what<00:00:27.120> we<00:00:27.210> call<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> level<00:00:27.930> system<00:00:28.380> for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
what we call the level system for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.950 
what we call the level system for
example<00:00:29.250> any<00:00:29.790> accident<00:00:30.450> that<00:00:30.600> you<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:30.870> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
throw throw the stick from higher up

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.569 
throw throw the stick from higher up
what<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.629> call<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> full<00:00:34.770> stroke<00:00:35.100> position

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
what we call from a full stroke position

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.579 
what we call from a full stroke position
like<00:00:35.879> here<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:39.449> provides<00:00:39.929> the<00:00:40.140> accent

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
like here that provides the accent

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.349 
like here that provides the accent
automatically<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.210> an
