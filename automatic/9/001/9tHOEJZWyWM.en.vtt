cockpit yet installed doing it on the
foldable<00:03:57.549> cockpit<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.239> normally<00:03:58.299> do<00:03:58.690> and

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
foldable cockpit like I normally do and

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.979 
foldable cockpit like I normally do and
it's<00:03:59.530> really<00:04:00.010> tight<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.340> cramped<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.840> got

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
it's really tight and cramped and I got

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.409 
it's really tight and cramped and I got
looking<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.859> three<00:04:03.569> actual<00:04:05.220> p40<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.430> the

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419

looking at the three actual p40 and the
dash<00:04:07.720> actually<00:04:08.560> came<00:04:09.069> inside<00:04:09.780> where<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
dash actually came inside where the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.430 
dash actually came inside where the
front<00:04:11.319> part<00:04:11.919> of<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.040> canopy<00:04:13.230> departed<00:04:14.230> so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
front part of the canopy departed so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.140 
front part of the canopy departed so
like<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.829> this<00:04:15.370> part<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.730> cave<00:04:15.910> was

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
like you this part of the cave was

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.120 
like you this part of the cave was
sliding<00:04:16.449> from<00:04:16.720> here<00:04:16.930> back<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.769> what<00:04:17.979> I'm<00:04:18.099> doing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
sliding from here back so what I'm doing

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.719 
sliding from here back so what I'm doing
is<00:04:18.609> I'm<00:04:19.260> gonna<00:04:20.260> extend<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.190> forward<00:04:21.669> a

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
is I'm gonna extend this forward a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.310 
is I'm gonna extend this forward a
little<00:04:21.849> bit<00:04:21.969> because<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.419> this<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:23.020> where<00:04:23.200> the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
little bit because we this is where the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.959 
little bit because we this is where the
dash<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.830> they<00:04:23.979> had<00:04:24.159> in<00:04:24.190> there<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.880> we're

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
dash that they had in there and we're

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.700 
dash that they had in there and we're
going<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.120> move<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.390> back<00:04:25.570> what<00:04:26.229> I've<00:04:26.320> done<00:04:26.440> is

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
going to move it back what I've done is

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.120 
going to move it back what I've done is
from

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
from

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.450 
from
edge<00:04:27.370> i<00:04:27.760> move<00:04:27.940> back<00:04:27.970> one<00:04:28.510> inch<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.260> i<00:04:30.070> put<00:04:30.430> a

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
edge i move back one inch and i put a

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.730 
edge i move back one inch and i put a
piece<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.670> tape<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.270> can<00:04:31.510> see<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.990> also

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
piece of tape that you can see and also

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.310 
piece of tape that you can see and also
you<00:04:32.950> can<00:04:33.160> see<00:04:33.340> there's<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.640> lip<00:04:33.940> here<00:04:34.420> that<00:04:34.990> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
you can see there's a lip here that the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.400 
you can see there's a lip here that the
canopy<00:04:36.010> was<00:04:36.760> glued<00:04:37.120> that's<00:04:37.450> glued<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:38.020> or<00:04:38.290> they

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
canopy was glued that's glued to or they

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.960 
canopy was glued that's glued to or they
screw<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.160> but<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.490> would<00:04:39.580> be<00:04:39.610> better<00:04:39.700> to

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
screw it to it but it would be better to

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.240 
screw it to it but it would be better to
glue<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.290> anyway<00:04:41.290> what<00:04:41.830> I'm<00:04:41.920> doing<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.190> I'm

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
glue it anyway what I'm doing is I'm

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.010 
glue it anyway what I'm doing is I'm
coming<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.610> here<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.210> took<00:04:43.270> quarter<00:04:43.840> inch

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
coming in here and I took quarter inch

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.790 
coming in here and I took quarter inch
and<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.620> left<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.280> lip<00:04:45.550> there<00:04:45.930> where<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.560> kit

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
and I left the lip there where the kit

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.000 
and I left the lip there where the kit
where<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.340> canopy<00:04:48.820> can<00:04:49.000> be<00:04:49.150> glued<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.080> so

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
where the canopy can be glued to that so

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.220 
where the canopy can be glued to that so
I<00:04:51.040> will<00:04:51.490> come<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.730> here<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.600> won't<00:04:52.810> continue

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
I will come in here and I won't continue

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.230 
I will come in here and I won't continue
cut<00:04:53.680> I'm<00:04:53.800> gonna<00:04:53.950> cut<00:04:54.130> this<00:04:54.280> on<00:04:54.520> forward<00:04:55.060> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
cut I'm gonna cut this on forward and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.620 
cut I'm gonna cut this on forward and
remove<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.590> one<00:04:56.890> inch<00:04:57.100> piece<00:04:57.510> we're<00:04:58.510> going

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
remove this one inch piece we're going

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.330 
remove this one inch piece we're going
to<00:04:58.750> do<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.590> we<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.830> get<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.040> dash<00:05:00.310> a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
to do that so we can get the dash a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.360 
to do that so we can get the dash a
little<00:05:01.090> bit<00:05:01.210> further<00:05:01.450> forward<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.230> that<00:05:03.130> will

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
little bit further forward and that will

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.240 
little bit further forward and that will
allow<00:05:03.640> us<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.200> cockpit<00:05:05.710> won't<00:05:06.010> be

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
allow us to get so the cockpit won't be

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.790 
allow us to get so the cockpit won't be
so<00:05:06.550> cramped<00:05:07.330> trying<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.140> get<00:05:08.260> everything<00:05:08.470> in

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
so cramped trying to get everything in

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.070 
so cramped trying to get everything in
there<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.490> will<00:05:09.820> go<00:05:09.850> ahead<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.390> make<00:05:11.050> that

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080
