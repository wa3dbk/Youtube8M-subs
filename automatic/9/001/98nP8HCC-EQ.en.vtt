team<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> week<00:01:11.640> cards<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:13.410> 13<00:01:14.190> weeks

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
team the week cards so that's 13 weeks

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.080 
team the week cards so that's 13 weeks
in<00:01:14.729> club<00:01:15.240> plus<00:01:16.220> preseason<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.580> guess<00:01:17.819> that's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
in club plus preseason so I guess that's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.279 
in club plus preseason so I guess that's
14<00:01:18.890> batches<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.179> yeah<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.599> this

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
14 batches that we have but yeah is this

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.219 
14 batches that we have but yeah is this
set<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.860> worth<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.810> don't<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.929> because

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
set really worth it I don't know because

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.240 
set really worth it I don't know because
I<00:01:25.739> haven't<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.729> been<00:01:26.970> pulling<00:01:27.300> elites<00:01:27.569> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
I haven't really been pulling elites and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
I haven't really been pulling elites and
this<00:01:29.250> set<00:01:30.000> does<00:01:30.300> cost<00:01:30.569> a<00:01:30.810> fair<00:01:31.140> amount<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this set does cost a fair amount so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
this set does cost a fair amount so
let's<00:01:32.220> say<00:01:32.459> we<00:01:32.489> get<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.209> gold<00:01:33.450> trophies<00:01:33.929> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
let's say we get the gold trophies for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
let's say we get the gold trophies for
about<00:01:34.530> 5<00:01:35.310> K<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:36.530> 4k<00:01:37.530> each<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.599> um<00:01:40.849> now<00:01:41.849> let's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
about 5 K or 4k each and um now let's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.229 
about 5 K or 4k each and um now let's
say<00:01:42.149> five<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.959> need<00:01:43.610> 745<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.060> that's

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:45.239 
say five so you need 745 so that's

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.949 
say five so you need 745 so that's
there's<00:01:45.750> 35<00:01:46.349> k<00:01:46.679> right<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.489> then<00:01:48.239> for

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
there's 35 k right there and then for

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.660 
there's 35 k right there and then for
the<00:01:49.080> elite<00:01:49.289> trophies<00:01:49.679> you<00:01:49.830> can<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.429> for

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the elite trophies you can get them for

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
the elite trophies you can get them for
about<00:01:50.819> 9<00:01:51.479> k<00:01:52.459> so<00:01:53.459> nine<00:01:53.759> times<00:01:53.789> three<00:01:54.209> that's<00:01:54.539> 27

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
about 9 k so nine times three that's 27

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
about 9 k so nine times three that's 27
so<00:01:56.069> add<00:01:56.250> those<00:01:56.459> together<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:57.179> looking<00:01:57.569> at

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
so add those together we're looking at

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
so add those together we're looking at
about<00:01:59.629> 50<00:02:00.629> plus<00:02:01.200> 27<00:02:02.509> about<00:02:05.060> 62<00:02:06.060> k<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.929> 62<00:02:07.619> k<00:02:07.890> for

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
about 50 plus 27 about 62 k so 62 k for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
about 50 plus 27 about 62 k so 62 k for
the<00:02:08.429> set<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:09.660> always<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:10.080> an

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
