we have this morning we're going to be
given<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.790> demonstration<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> floss<00:00:39.110> short

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
given a demonstration of the floss short

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.470 
given a demonstration of the floss short
we've<00:00:39.770> really<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.160> large<00:00:40.580> shortwave<00:00:41.120> radio

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
we've really a large shortwave radio

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.200 
we've really a large shortwave radio
listening<00:00:42.020> I<00:00:42.879> have<00:00:44.020> various<00:00:45.020> shortwave

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
listening I have various shortwave

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.509 
listening I have various shortwave
receivers<00:00:47.210> set<00:00:47.450> up<00:00:47.570> here<00:00:47.809> in<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.960> shack<00:00:48.519> to

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
receivers set up here in the shack to

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.820 
receivers set up here in the shack to
give<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.879> little<00:00:50.089> demonstration<00:00:50.629> here<00:00:51.379> you

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
give you a little demonstration here you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.950 
give you a little demonstration here you
may<00:00:51.980> be<00:00:52.010> asking<00:00:52.580> yourself<00:00:53.000> what<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.360> shortwave

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
may be asking yourself what is shortwave

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.000 
may be asking yourself what is shortwave
radio<00:00:54.610> or<00:00:55.610> what<00:00:55.820> is<00:00:56.030> shortwave<00:00:56.540> radio

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
radio or what is shortwave radio

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030 
radio or what is shortwave radio
listening<00:00:59.170> shortwave<00:01:00.170> listening<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.830> known

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040

to<00:01:01.309> be<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.460> hobby<00:01:01.839> shortwave<00:01:02.839> is<00:01:03.019> better<00:01:03.260> than

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
to be a hobby shortwave is better than

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.030 
to be a hobby shortwave is better than
normal<00:01:03.890> a.m.<00:01:04.250> or<00:01:04.400> FM<00:01:04.820> radio<00:01:05.770> because<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.920> is

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
normal a.m. or FM radio because it is

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.860 
normal a.m. or FM radio because it is
higher<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:08.200> frequency<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.210> therefore<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.630> can

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
higher in frequency and therefore it can

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.149 
higher in frequency and therefore it can
go<00:01:12.020> longer<00:01:12.850> range<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.770> even<00:01:15.770> around<00:01:16.010> the
