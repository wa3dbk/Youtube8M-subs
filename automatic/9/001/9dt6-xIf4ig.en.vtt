00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 a thousand kilos 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.400
 I think too little now 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.010
 have mounting hardware 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.869
 and there attitude for me they need more 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 span sit longer even more 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.170
 yes but in europe in him and billions 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.930
 a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 this man abuse okay buddy of her 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 able to release yes not forward and rob does 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 no but if you have a break me out 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.450
 must go ahead he gave but the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.280
 side 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.840
 just had it off 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.580
 now you know that look on the road 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960
 the police don't just turn on the blue 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.360
 higher believes 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.910
 we want to see proof we want it 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.500
 preferably test it yourself, because practice 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.100
 is often different from legislation 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.100
 implies 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 legislation itself does not provide guidelines 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.840
 it only says that cargo has to be that way 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.820
 are assured that it is not from it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 vehicle can fall off and you have to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.750
 take him into account and spend euros 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.870
 work my nose and slum think 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 for example, but he does set you standards 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.540
 for in europe 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 it describes how to charge 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.300
 must fix with regard to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.580
 forces 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.110
 one of the forces is the forward 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 power that is the greatest power of how 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.260
 be sure 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.150
 and it says in the standard that you go for 80 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.020
 percent of the weight the load must 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 secure 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.800
 the thousand kilo 800 kilogram fuses 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.990
 power 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.640
 going sideways backwards must be 50 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.940
 percent of the weight they are sure to be 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 Thus at 1000 kilograms to 500 kilograms in 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.670
 those directions 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.830
 have you met that condition then 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 the salad secured as you now loaded 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.160
 by whether I participate in every test on this one 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.649
 cargo does not come from large 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:55.200
 first see words then believe 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.830
 well indeed menu to our practice 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 glum 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.510
 with the straps that the respective 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.370
 suspect has used we will 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.350
 about what this load 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.300
 a piece or 16 needed one 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.190
 tape is always too little 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.619
 because then you only have one 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.230
 direction that can be secured 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.239
 no matter how you handle it, now we are going to 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.370
 test situation such as traffic police 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.650
 who just found it en route 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.320
 a strap from front to back and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 then the same evasive maneuver the proof 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.760
 of the pudding is in the eating 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.579
 what happened here wasn't that one 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.950
 said the load has shifted 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.290
 cargo entered into the cities side 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 city ​​and raised edge and also 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.500
 all continue guided current game 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.459
 physics 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.459
 goes his own way
