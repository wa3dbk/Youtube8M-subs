00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.600
 and we did not take out goku the Chinese 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.779
 our vocation is the steering wheel of 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.779
 University of Chile 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.259
 this year we are going to take months 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 the first to attend the stadium goes to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.670
 be a really very good show 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.340
 sports university of chile is the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.530
 best team and day of Chilean football is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.330
 the best team in South America and in that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.150
 context will logically find 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.220
 a very structured very fast team of 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.690
 very good football level and it's 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.540
 expect that this also fills him 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.340
 joy to the Japanese and all the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.470
 hobby also that we can have as 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.239
 future premiere we would like to do 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.430
 greater ties is to strengthen our 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.200
 ties not only friendship but 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.330
 also sports exchange between 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.950
 the Japanese and our country so this 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.350
 it can be the beginning of a great 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 existing relationship in a sporty way and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.450
 friendly between the photos you pay and the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.060
 Chilean football game bench that not a day 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.760
 Slim animated systems control 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.790
 of action are very well 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 in a jump of 13 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.280
 good the games that play them and already 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.680
 We will hopefully accompany the team 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.410
 you want is chile in japan to play the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.460
 suruga cup and in that context we 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.860
 we also trust it to be a good 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.290
 match and that was played in a way 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.510
 very professional and that the best 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.960
 both team can logically lift 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.729
 said trophy and on court you will see the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.050
 power of the people and also Tuesday 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.250
 It will be the power of the University of Chile 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 to be able to achieve it 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.500
 in this country university of chile is a 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.869
 very very famous team in chile has 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.620
 also together with colo colo and this 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.460
 last year has made much success much 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.650
 success because he won the South American Cup 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.470
 with what is going to go to japan to play the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.110
 suruga bank 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.210
 Y 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.690
 that's going to play against asthma 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.690
 santoral 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.500
 it's difficult I honestly am I am 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 Japanese fan of Kashima Antlers 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.300
 because I liked a lot boy yes with very 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.420
 acquaintances and I had an uncle who traveled to 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.930
 Japan because he worked in a company and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.680
 he when I was little he brought me one of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.840
 kashima antlers then me there 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.970
 She started to like me a lot of teams 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 I would like to stay from kashima but 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.650
 you also have to support Chilean football 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.099
 and I think it's going to be a very, very, very 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.099
 fought 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.109
 He says 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.720
