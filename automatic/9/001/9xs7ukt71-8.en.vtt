particular with these three they're
using<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.430> exact<00:02:55.670> same<00:02:55.820> motherboard<00:02:56.210> as<00:02:56.300> well

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
using the exact same motherboard as well

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.540

so<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.770> sense<00:02:57.950> what<00:02:58.070> you're<00:02:58.160> paying<00:02:58.310> for<00:02:58.400> is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
so in a sense what you're paying for is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.580 
so in a sense what you're paying for is
a<00:02:58.730> lot<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.150> extras<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.780> terms<00:03:00.020> of<00:03:00.230> what

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
a lot of extras in terms of what

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.570 
a lot of extras in terms of what

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.350 
do you want the best DVD burner do you

these systems plus we want you to vote
for<00:06:10.250> which<00:06:10.400> system<00:06:10.759> you<00:06:10.849> think<00:06:11.060> looks<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
for which system you think looks the

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.540 
for which system you think looks the
best<00:06:11.719> so<00:06:12.380> I'll<00:06:12.469> come<00:06:12.650> above<00:06:12.919> you<00:06:13.069> know<00:06:13.159> I<00:06:13.190> go<00:06:13.490> to

wouldn't know what you think about these

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.490 
wouldn't know what you think about these
systems<00:06:17.120> or<00:06:17.539> if<00:06:17.810> we<00:06:17.900> should<00:06:18.080> never<00:06:18.199> show

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
systems or if we should never show

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.400 
systems or if we should never show
pretty<00:06:18.770> systems<00:06:19.130> again
