 for adif as she feels that this measure can only win this year 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.949
 the getafe wanted to do for a year 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:09.419
 after throwing 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.579
 how would it be desirable 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:12.979
 on the 7th visa 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.279
 in the day in this way it was quite new 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 he is called psoe or indiana himself 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.819
 for this company 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.230
 will be to make the interviewees believe 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 a great political knowledge 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.509
 there is a journalistic training 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.960
 as to go beyond the headlines the preferred sites are 19 means 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.810
 graphics 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.190
 in the eleven 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 this stoppage like to separate any citizen 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.589
 from outside the obvious question that shows the seriousness 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.780
 Chairwoman 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.110
 Per hundred I wonder 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990
 what has to do with the bad 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.460
 I told him he was surprised that it has to do with having teenage children to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 in that place 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 what was your concern is that I 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 a teenage daughter like the one who has 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.700
 and what are the things that have 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.460
 I would like it to happen to your daughter 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.940
 as how do you think that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.850
 of a teenager stops in this country dt 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.460
 what perspectives does it have 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.280
 i 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.049
 agmer rivers unfortunately I am interested in asking you why I asked 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.689
 i wake of ovas part humala assured that the people this field vidal 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.630
 these stories 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.580
 listen to officials of the pm case 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 and that took when when he flew he manages to take out and 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.930
 instead of two 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560
 madero well 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 Marco Fabian 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.930
 arona thing 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.060
 inside the road 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 headquarters of the xiv biennial adadhdad similar policy 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 and as we told you at the beginning 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.370
 i 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.820
 lately the political when 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.390
 when he returns to preach 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 first when the press team makes you and the type of crime is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 White color 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.450
 its producer 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.479
 the country demanded that it's vital that we've counted too much 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.529
 He did not give the goal to that much 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.909
 Of course I'm not interested in putting and as anyone to have 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.299
 igor g 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.959
 I did not bring anything with this 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.389
 the migrants in the third place 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.719
 d but 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.709
 percent 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.049
 the sepi well when when for that place in a farce 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.150
 because apart from that there is talk of 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.409
 from another place 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.149
 milonga that there are no people who have never been made 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.159
 ball the smell place that guy in one place and he asked that the magma does not have 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.319
 much more to do with the activity 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.449
 and then if it does not happen to us and if they go on stage 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 but when the politician to that place 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.119
 we do not miss 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.299
 and I spent many things were of interest to the field 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.879
 and among all we are going to cobos not being able to the theater but I think that things are going 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.339
 quickly and delivered ten years 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.809
 santana well little 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.229
 they are going to press 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.729
 of pedro botelho would name the funeral 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.819
 why not 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.429
 the now political in general know that the means 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.429
 there they can take a certain position 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.729
 periodic 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.489
 because they do political analysis was economic 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.319
 that takes position 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.229
 and there they are encolumnados with means 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.319
 or with certain ideas 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.759
 p 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.629
 by the way, what is said 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.629
 villa and ccoo and everyone knows what scene 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.519
 I'm on the list 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.090
 every day because sometimes 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.800
 that is, they know that there are no ulterior motives when asked 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.930
 he asked why the question comes to me not because they are asking me question of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.649
 this 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:44.779
 let's see if we do anything
