I<00:02:55.270> only<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.660> three<00:02:55.960> but<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.800> future<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.160> do

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
I only have three but in the future I do

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.370 
I only have three but in the future I do
plan<00:02:57.520> on<00:02:57.670> adding<00:02:57.850> more<00:02:58.120> if<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:59.050> want<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> add

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
plan on adding more if you want to add

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.560 
plan on adding more if you want to add
males<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.160> females<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:01.090> make<00:03:01.270> sure<00:03:01.450> you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
males and females just make sure you

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.200 
males and females just make sure you
have<00:03:02.070> try<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.100> get<00:03:03.310> more<00:03:03.460> females<00:03:03.970> than<00:03:04.060> males

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
have try to get more females than males

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.840 
have try to get more females than males
because<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.110> most<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:05.740> give<00:03:06.040> aggressive

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
because the most can give aggressive

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.120 
because the most can give aggressive
towards<00:03:07.600> each<00:03:07.720> other<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.200> it's<00:03:08.770> not<00:03:08.950> enough

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
towards each other if it's not enough

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.830 
towards each other if it's not enough
female<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.670> go<00:03:09.790> around<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.660> make<00:03:10.810> sure

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
female so go around so just make sure

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.290 
female so go around so just make sure
you<00:03:11.080> balance<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.890> have<00:03:12.430> three<00:03:12.700> males<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.270> I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
you balance that I have three males so I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.120 
you balance that I have three males so I
don't<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.290> worry<00:03:14.440> about<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.040> in

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
don't have to worry about that but in

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.340 
don't have to worry about that but in
the<00:03:15.220> future<00:03:15.430> when<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.730> add<00:03:15.880> more<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.390> have<00:03:17.320> to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the future when I add more I have to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.680 
the future when I add more I have to
think<00:03:17.560> about<00:03:17.800> that<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.180> make<00:03:19.420> sure<00:03:19.450> you

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
think about that and just make sure you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.330 
think about that and just make sure you
have<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.960> right<00:03:20.110> tank<00:03:20.350> mates<00:03:20.620> these<00:03:20.950> fish<00:03:21.190> are
