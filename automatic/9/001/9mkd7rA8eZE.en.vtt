sticks out a little bit but you know
it's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> urethane<00:02:12.959> rubber<00:02:13.290> spider<00:02:13.860> which

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
it's not a urethane rubber spider which

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's not a urethane rubber spider which
I<00:02:14.730> kind<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:15.659> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I kind of like because there's a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.780 
I kind of like because there's a
wait<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.450> move<00:02:16.540> around<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.170> tenant

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
wait I can move around and just tenant

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680 
wait I can move around and just tenant
because<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.000> cool<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:22.330> are<00:02:22.360> going

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
because it's cool so also they are going

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.360 
because it's cool so also they are going
to<00:02:22.750> modify<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> spider<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:24.070> going<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
to modify the spider it's going to be a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.930 
to modify the spider it's going to be a
little<00:02:24.670> bit<00:02:24.820> bigger<00:02:25.500> which<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.860> gonna<00:02:27.100> look

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
little bit bigger which it's gonna look

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.930 
little bit bigger which it's gonna look
better<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.240> think<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.920> else<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.490> shoes<00:02:30.760> are

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940

most<00:03:09.730> comfortable<00:03:10.120> shoes<00:03:10.270> I've<00:03:10.420> ever<00:03:10.510> worn

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
most comfortable shoes I've ever worn

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.370 
most comfortable shoes I've ever worn
I'm<00:03:13.150> really<00:03:13.420> I'm<00:03:13.540> really<00:03:13.570> excited<00:03:13.959> with<00:03:14.170> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.980 
I'm really I'm really excited with it
and<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.850> just<00:03:16.030> can't<00:03:16.180> wait<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.510> see<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.810> other

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
and I just can't wait to see the other

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.080 
and I just can't wait to see the other
one<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:17.709> when<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.040> ready<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.580> think<00:03:18.760> it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
one when it's when it's ready I think it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.210 
one when it's when it's ready I think it
should<00:03:19.300> be<00:03:19.330> ready<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:20.650> about<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.920> month<00:03:21.130> or

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
should be ready and in about a month or

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.190 
should be ready and in about a month or
so<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.760> I'll<00:03:22.269> make<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> review<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.019> and

the<00:03:33.400> back<00:03:33.610> again<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.300> think<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.690> spider<00:03:35.019> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the back again I think the spider is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.900 
the back again I think the spider is
going<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.410> be<00:03:36.090> bigger<00:03:37.090> as<00:03:37.269> well<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:38.910> they're

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
going to be bigger as well and they're

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.520 
going to be bigger as well and they're
going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.150> lower<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.510> waste<00:03:40.750> it's<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.320> little

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
going to lower the waste it's a little

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.590 
going to lower the waste it's a little
high<00:03:41.709> up<00:03:41.890> here<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.760> kind<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:42.970> makes<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.420> look

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
high up here so it kind of makes it look

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.009 
high up here so it kind of makes it look
thanks<00:03:44.560> always<00:03:44.799> look<00:03:44.980> cool<00:03:45.660> Weir's<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.810> think

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
thanks always look cool Weir's I think

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.770

makes<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.769> feel<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.100> was<00:03:48.250> shorter<00:03:49.209> smaller

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
makes it feel like I was shorter smaller

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.310 
makes it feel like I was shorter smaller
torso<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.890> back<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> think<00:03:52.510> they're<00:03:53.200> going

amazing job in sewing all the back here

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.010 
amazing job in sewing all the back here
I<00:04:46.720> think<00:04:47.320> they<00:04:47.590> actually<00:04:48.599> they<00:04:49.599> modify<00:04:49.990> a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
I think they actually they modify a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.050 
I think they actually they modify a
zipper<00:04:50.470> back<00:04:50.620> here<00:04:50.950> because<00:04:51.669> on<00:04:51.849> the<00:04:51.970> other

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
zipper back here because on the other

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.750 
zipper back here because on the other
TASM<00:04:52.599> to<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.520> they<00:04:55.169> is<00:04:56.169> more<00:04:56.440> visible<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:56.890> this

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
TASM to to they is more visible so this

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.860 
TASM to to they is more visible so this
one's<00:04:58.140> definitely<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.410> lot<00:04:59.650> better<00:05:00.870> also

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
one's definitely a lot better also

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.100 
one's definitely a lot better also
another<00:05:02.700> part<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.270> how<00:05:04.450> they<00:05:04.599> had<00:05:04.780> this

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
another part I like is how they had this

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.610 
another part I like is how they had this
part<00:05:05.530> right<00:05:05.650> here<00:05:05.740> right<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.610> crotch<00:05:06.789> area

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
part right here right in the crotch area

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.810 
part right here right in the crotch area
the<00:05:08.620> lines<00:05:08.860> they're<00:05:09.099> just<00:05:09.250> like<00:05:09.340> in<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.520> movie

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
the lines they're just like in the movie

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.029 
the lines they're just like in the movie
now<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:10.450> think<00:05:10.570> Andrew<00:05:11.050> Garfield<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.710> movie

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
now I think Andrew Garfield in the movie

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.930 
now I think Andrew Garfield in the movie
use<00:05:12.970> zippers<00:05:13.890> because<00:05:14.890> he<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.370> know<00:05:15.430> you<00:05:15.700> go

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
use zippers because he you know you go

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.000 
use zippers because he you know you go
to<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.060> bathroom<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.690> how<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.680> don't<00:05:17.950> know

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
to the bathroom but how I don't know

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.839 
to the bathroom but how I don't know
that<00:05:18.190> it'll<00:05:18.370> look<00:05:18.400> weird

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
that it'll look weird

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.880 
that it'll look weird
tie<00:05:19.300> some<00:05:19.510> zippers<00:05:19.810> ear<00:05:20.020> hanging<00:05:20.740> down<00:05:20.860> there

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
tie some zippers ear hanging down there

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.270 
tie some zippers ear hanging down there
so<00:05:22.020> they<00:05:23.020> left<00:05:23.229> it<00:05:23.349> like<00:05:23.470> this<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.979> they<00:05:24.070> just

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280
