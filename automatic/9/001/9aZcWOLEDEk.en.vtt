00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:23.310
 Mykrafte cities drove today 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 the issue will be devoted to the city ​​that is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 I have not built a village so dear by 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.849
 title you guessed well, that is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.890
 the first trees of my city that is already 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.940
 as if next year but this is not gart 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 simple village 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.809
 well then let's talk about 1 on opinion 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 in my town 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.280
 that's what it would be for you ask it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 contact network contact network you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 probably know what it is but still 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.500
 strung all worth such a contact network 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 Well it means when wiring 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 went by train or train there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 all the time 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 so these would have hung down 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 feed electricity to the train 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 before the train and everything is on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.909
 let's finish our explanation 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 Now we will go on our trolley in 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.060

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.640
 so it will be a village like this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 the station will now be called 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.870
