it's leaked so someone was a little
overzealous<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:38.750> would<00:00:38.900> assume<00:00:39.140> and

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
overzealous I would assume and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.780 
overzealous I would assume and
accidentally<00:00:39.980> leaked<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.280> footage<00:00:40.430> or

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
accidentally leaked the footage or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.340 
accidentally leaked the footage or
leaked<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:41.239> on<00:00:41.360> purpose<00:00:41.600> something<00:00:42.019> like<00:00:42.170> that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
leaked it on purpose something like that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.649 
leaked it on purpose something like that

and so now there's this video floating

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.390

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
around which I will show you guys of a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.770 
around which I will show you guys of a
bunch<00:00:46.580> of<00:00:46.699> Mesmer<00:00:47.120> skills<00:00:47.449> I'm<00:00:47.600> going<00:00:47.720> to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
bunch of Mesmer skills I'm going to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.660 
bunch of Mesmer skills I'm going to
analyze<00:00:48.080> a<00:00:48.199> little<00:00:48.500> bit<00:00:48.650> so<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:49.430> go

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
analyze a little bit so here we go

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.009 
analyze a little bit so here we go
alright<00:00:50.269> so<00:00:50.420> starting<00:00:50.750> from<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:50.960> beginning

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
alright so starting from the beginning

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.420 
alright so starting from the beginning
of<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.409> clips<00:00:51.650> we<00:00:51.769> can<00:00:51.920> see<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.159> there's<00:00:52.369> a

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
of the clips we can see that there's a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.460 
of the clips we can see that there's a
char<00:00:52.760> cast<00:00:53.089> or<00:00:53.299> presumably<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.960> Mesmer<00:00:54.229> being

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
char cast or presumably the Mesmer being

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.950 
char cast or presumably the Mesmer being
followed<00:00:54.710> by<00:00:54.979> two<00:00:55.040> teammates<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.970> an<00:00:56.479> enemy

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
followed by two teammates and an enemy

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.600 
followed by two teammates and an enemy
creature<00:00:57.290> I'm<00:00:57.530> assuming<00:00:57.890> that's<00:00:57.979> an<00:00:58.190> Ettin

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
creature I'm assuming that's an Ettin

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.009 
creature I'm assuming that's an Ettin
from<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> original<00:00:59.269> Guild<00:00:59.449> Wars<00:00:59.570> so<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.869> can

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
from the original Guild Wars so we can

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.329 
from the original Guild Wars so we can
see<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.379> come<00:01:00.589> back<00:01:00.739> from<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:00.979> creature

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
see it come back from that creature

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.039 
see it come back from that creature
that's<00:01:01.580> kind<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.879> interesting<00:01:02.180> otherwise

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
that's kind of interesting otherwise

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.840 
that's kind of interesting otherwise
it's<00:01:03.260> just<00:01:03.290> some<00:01:03.530> sort<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.799> random<00:01:04.280> ogre<00:01:04.640> thing

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
it's just some sort of random ogre thing

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.880 
it's just some sort of random ogre thing
the<00:01:05.390> Mesmer<00:01:05.810> throws<00:01:06.080> down<00:01:06.260> some<00:01:06.500> kind<00:01:06.799> of

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
the Mesmer throws down some kind of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.250 
the Mesmer throws down some kind of
cloaking<00:01:07.310> AoE<00:01:07.909> spell<00:01:08.360> could<00:01:08.659> be<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.869> ward

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
cloaking AoE spell could be a ward

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.200 
cloaking AoE spell could be a ward
although<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:09.830> thought<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.580> words<00:01:10.850> were<00:01:11.030> going

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
although I thought that words were going

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.850 
although I thought that words were going
to<00:01:11.299> be<00:01:11.390> exclusive<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.170> Guardian<00:01:12.560> spells

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
to be exclusive to the Guardian spells

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.230 
to be exclusive to the Guardian spells
it<00:01:13.400> would<00:01:13.520> appear<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.970> causes

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it would appear that it causes

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.969 
it would appear that it causes
invisibility<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.500> makes<00:01:15.679> the<00:01:15.829> end

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
invisibility and so that makes the end

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.730 
invisibility and so that makes the end
creature<00:01:16.310> run<00:01:16.609> away<00:01:16.850> or<00:01:16.880> lose<00:01:17.359> aggro<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.109> then

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
creature run away or lose aggro and then

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.950 
creature run away or lose aggro and then
they'll<00:01:18.890> reappear<00:01:19.189> again<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.909> also<00:01:20.539> looks

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
they'll reappear again it also looks

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.709 
they'll reappear again it also looks
like<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.920> charm<00:01:22.609> mezmur<00:01:23.090> has<00:01:23.270> some<00:01:23.509> kind

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
like that the charm mezmur has some kind

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.319 
like that the charm mezmur has some kind
of<00:01:23.929> sword<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.619> perhaps<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.280> club<00:01:25.609> or<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:25.880> mace<00:01:26.149> or

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
of sword and perhaps a club or a mace or

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.419 
of sword and perhaps a club or a mace or
some<00:01:26.509> kind<00:01:26.719> of<00:01:26.780> off<00:01:26.990> hand<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.249> could

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
some kind of off hand like that it could

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.039 
some kind of off hand like that it could
also<00:01:28.579> be<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.820> focus<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.539> assuming<00:01:29.659> that

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
also be a focus but I'm assuming that

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.510 
also be a focus but I'm assuming that
it's<00:01:30.200> some<00:01:30.350> sort<00:01:30.499> of<00:01:30.619> mace<00:01:30.829> or<00:01:31.009> something<00:01:31.369> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's some sort of mace or something and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.429 
it's some sort of mace or something and
he<00:01:31.579> does<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:31.939> little<00:01:32.210> taunted<00:01:33.200> when<00:01:33.350> he

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
he does a little taunted when he

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.469 
he does a little taunted when he
finishes<00:01:33.740> killing<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.280> creature<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
finishes killing the creature on to the

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.870 
finishes killing the creature on to the
next<00:01:35.689> clip<00:01:35.990> alright<00:01:36.829> so<00:01:37.009> even<00:01:37.310> before<00:01:37.429> seeing

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
next clip alright so even before seeing

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.130 
next clip alright so even before seeing
the<00:01:37.969> Mesmer<00:01:38.299> I<00:01:38.329> can<00:01:38.539> tell<00:01:38.689> it's<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.049> be

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the Mesmer I can tell it's going to be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.660 
the Mesmer I can tell it's going to be
as<00:01:39.259> urn<00:01:39.439> because<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.009> surroundings<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
as urn because of the surroundings and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.279 
as urn because of the surroundings and
there<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:40.969> go<00:01:40.999> there's<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.539> user<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.929> Mesmer

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
there we go there's the user and Mesmer

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.830 
there we go there's the user and Mesmer
and<00:01:42.469> it<00:01:43.249> thinks<00:01:43.670> everything<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.299> evil<00:01:44.659> and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and it thinks everything is evil and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.029 
and it thinks everything is evil and
probably<00:01:45.109> going<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.319> call<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.619> thing<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.859> book

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
probably going to call that thing a book

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.830 
probably going to call that thing a book
and<00:01:46.399> then<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:46.850> we<00:01:46.939> go<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.240> have<00:01:47.390> some<00:01:47.630> sort

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and then there we go we have some sort

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.899 
and then there we go we have some sort
of<00:01:47.929> creature<00:01:48.140> approaching<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.520> looks<00:01:49.759> as

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
of creature approaching and it looks as

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.270 
of creature approaching and it looks as
though<00:01:49.969> it<00:01:50.479> has<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.719> focus<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.710> sword<00:01:51.979> again

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
though it has a focus and a sword again

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160 
though it has a focus and a sword again
and<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.549> creates<00:01:52.819> to<00:01:53.030> sort<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.359> illusions<00:01:54.079> that

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
and it creates to sort of illusions that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.959 
and it creates to sort of illusions that
can<00:01:54.439> attack<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.039> that's<00:01:55.159> interesting<00:01:55.819> so

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
can attack and that's interesting so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.899 
can attack and that's interesting so
they<00:01:56.479> start<00:01:56.719> attacking<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.409> I'm<00:01:58.130> curious<00:01:58.670> to

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
they start attacking and I'm curious to

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.340 
they start attacking and I'm curious to
know<00:01:59.090> whether<00:01:59.329> or<00:01:59.569> not<00:01:59.689> they're<00:01:59.929> dealing<00:02:00.289> a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
know whether or not they're dealing a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.050 
know whether or not they're dealing a
ton<00:02:00.679> of<00:02:00.710> damage<00:02:01.009> or<00:02:01.340> when<00:02:01.520> they're<00:02:01.639> destroyed

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
ton of damage or when they're destroyed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.489 
ton of damage or when they're destroyed
if<00:02:02.240> they<00:02:02.359> deal<00:02:02.539> damage<00:02:02.749> I'm<00:02:03.049> assuming<00:02:03.409> they

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
if they deal damage I'm assuming they

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.980 
if they deal damage I'm assuming they
deal<00:02:03.649> damage<00:02:03.859> as<00:02:04.189> they're<00:02:04.639> alive<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.389> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
deal damage as they're alive and that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.629 
deal damage as they're alive and that
could<00:02:06.139> post<00:02:06.380> me<00:02:06.560> quite<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.799> powerful<00:02:07.009> skill<00:02:07.399> and

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
could post me quite a powerful skill and

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.490 
could post me quite a powerful skill and
then<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:07.909> see<00:02:08.119> them<00:02:08.330> lay<00:02:08.509> some<00:02:08.840> sort<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.110> AoE

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
then we see them lay some sort of AoE

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.350 
then we see them lay some sort of AoE
trap<00:02:09.950> I'm<00:02:10.160> assuming<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:10.610> AoE<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.209> could

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
trap I'm assuming it's AoE but it could

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.480 
trap I'm assuming it's AoE but it could
just<00:02:11.480> be<00:02:11.569> single<00:02:11.840> target<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.920> slows<00:02:13.250> or

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
just be single target and it slows or

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
just be single target and it slows or
confuses<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.180> target<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.990> Mesmer

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
confuses the target and then the Mesmer

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.800 
confuses the target and then the Mesmer
is<00:02:15.560> able<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.160> track<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.670> down<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.150> kill<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.480> on

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
is able to track it down and kill it on

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.980

to the third clip in this third clip we

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.450 
to the third clip in this third clip we
see<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.470> environment<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.010> somewhat

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460

what<00:02:34.860> looks<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.280> an<00:02:35.580> AoE<00:02:36.000> damage<00:02:36.150> spell

interesting inclusion and I wouldn't be

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240 
interesting inclusion and I wouldn't be
surprised<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:42.930> what<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.500> some

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250

could<00:02:49.260> possibly<00:02:49.770> be<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
could possibly be and then here it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.170 
I think this is interesting that there
is<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> specific<00:03:29.130> skill<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.700> allows<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.150> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
is a specific skill that allows you to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
is a specific skill that allows you to
explode<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.870> illusions<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.560> deal<00:03:31.770> damage

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
explode your illusions and deal damage

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.900 
explode your illusions and deal damage

onto the fifth clip now for the fifth
and<00:03:36.209> final<00:03:36.240> clip<00:03:37.190> okay<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.490> would<00:03:38.640> appear

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
and final clip okay so it would appear

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.730 
and final clip okay so it would appear
that<00:03:38.970> we're<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.270> very<00:03:39.300> wasteland<00:03:40.290> ish<00:03:40.470> type

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
if I'm wrong but it looks very similar

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.970

to portal but the creature is not so

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.900 
to portal but the creature is not so
that<00:04:06.780> gives<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.290> Mesmer<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.800> ability<00:04:08.220> to
