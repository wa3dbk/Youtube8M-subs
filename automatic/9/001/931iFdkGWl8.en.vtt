00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
a low AC spring and that's limited him a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.780 
a low AC spring and that's limited him a
little<00:03:22.800> bit<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.980> practice<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.400> last<00:03:23.610> couple

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790

I think they got it ordered takes a

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.430 
I think they got it ordered takes a
while<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.150> me<00:04:18.299> okay<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.840> think<00:04:18.989> they<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.290> think

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
while to me okay I think they I think

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.470 
while to me okay I think they I think
they<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:20.070> think<00:04:20.430> they<00:04:20.640> called<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.269> from
