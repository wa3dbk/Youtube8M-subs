like<00:00:56.879> stupid<00:00:57.390> pictures<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.500> becomes<00:00:58.769> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
like stupid pictures and it becomes a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310

main categories which i think are pretty
relevant<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> early<00:01:30.299> process<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> making

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
videos I'll say for everyone that it's a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
videos I'll say for everyone that it's a
good<00:01:34.200> idea<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.530> capture<00:01:34.950> all<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> your

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
good idea to capture all of your

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
gameplay in advance so you're not just

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
gameplay in advance so you're not just
jumping<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.530> again<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:37.860> 10<00:01:38.250> minutes<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> get

your<00:05:30.270> video<00:05:30.569> is<00:05:30.750> longer<00:05:30.990> than<00:05:31.080> 10<00:05:31.379> minutes<00:05:31.560> you

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
your video is longer than 10 minutes you

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.850 
your video is longer than 10 minutes you
really<00:05:32.190> need<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.849> cut<00:05:33.029> it<00:05:33.150> down<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.860> five-minute

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
really need to cut it down a five-minute

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.740 
really need to cut it down a five-minute
video<00:05:34.949> usually<00:05:35.610> takes<00:05:36.060> up<00:05:36.210> one<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.539> a<00:05:36.599> half

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
video usually takes up one and a half

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.740 
video usually takes up one and a half
pages<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.349> word<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:37.770> that's<00:05:38.099> what<00:05:38.279> I<00:05:38.310> aim<00:05:38.580> for

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
pages in word so that's what I aim for

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.999 
pages in word so that's what I aim for
so<00:05:39.750> now<00:05:39.960> we're<00:05:40.169> at<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.379> recording<00:05:40.889> audio

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
so now we're at the recording audio

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.369 
so now we're at the recording audio
stage<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:42.270> first<00:05:42.539> thing<00:05:42.750> you<00:05:42.870> should<00:05:42.900> do<00:05:43.199> is

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
stage the first thing you should do is

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.050 
stage the first thing you should do is
alter<00:05:43.740> with<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:43.919> settings<00:05:44.339> to<00:05:44.460> find<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.759> best

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
alter with the settings to find the best

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.059 
alter with the settings to find the best
balance<00:05:45.569> that<00:05:46.020> will<00:05:46.139> produce<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:46.589> cleanest

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
balance that will produce the cleanest

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.920 
balance that will produce the cleanest
audio<00:05:47.400> because<00:05:47.699> bad<00:05:47.940> audio<00:05:48.330> makes<00:05:48.599> people

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
audio because bad audio makes people

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.899
