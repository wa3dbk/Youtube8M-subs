is not when it will be released for iOS
I<00:00:55.980> am<00:00:56.100> NOT<00:00:56.430> guessing<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.289> going<00:00:58.289> from

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I am NOT guessing because going from

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
I am NOT guessing because going from
what<00:00:58.920> happened<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.430> ascension<00:00:59.820> guys<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
what happened with ascension guys it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.500 
what happened with ascension guys it
didn't<00:01:01.199> come<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.440> exactly<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> day<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
didn't come out exactly on the day so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.890 
didn't come out exactly on the day so
because<00:01:03.989> ascension<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.900> over

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
because ascension as you can see over

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
because ascension as you can see over
here<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.260> first<00:01:07.500> strike<00:01:07.950> map<00:01:07.979> pack<00:01:08.580> was

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
here the first strike map pack was

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.350 
here the first strike map pack was
released<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.920> call<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> duty<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
released from call of duty on the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620 
released from call of duty on the
consoles<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.650> second<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.630> 2011

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
consoles on the second of the first 2011

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.890 
consoles on the second of the first 2011
but<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.409> American<00:01:17.450> British<00:01:18.450> or

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
but this is in American British or

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.649 
but this is in American British or
whatever<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.130> us<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.670> Australian<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
whatever so for us for me Australian it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
whatever so for us for me Australian it
would<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> first<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> second<00:01:23.130> 2011

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
would be the first to the second 2011

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
would be the first to the second 2011
meaning<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.689> first<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.409> februari<00:01:26.000> 2011<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
meaning the first of februari 2011 and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
meaning the first of februari 2011 and
of<00:01:27.270> course<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.930> did<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> first

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of course we did not get the first

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.969 
of course we did not get the first
strike<00:01:29.340> map<00:01:29.369> pack<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> arm<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.409> first<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
strike map pack on the arm the first of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
strike map pack on the arm the first of
the<00:01:32.100> second<00:01:32.549> 2011<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> slightly<00:01:34.229> later

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the second 2011 we got it slightly later

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.390 
the second 2011 we got it slightly later
and<00:01:35.150> yeah<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> reasoning<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.400> my

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and yeah so that is the reasoning for my

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
and yeah so that is the reasoning for my
guests<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> arm<00:01:39.570> call<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> duty<00:01:40.259> black

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
guests for the arm call of duty black

dead I am my arm range that I would

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
dead I am my arm range that I would
guess<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> release<00:01:47.670> date<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
guess for the release date it would be

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
guess for the release date it would be
an<00:01:48.600> educated<00:01:49.140> guess<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.829> save<00:01:50.100> between<00:01:50.430> May

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
an educated guess to save between May

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.039 
an educated guess to save between May
which<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.579> arm<00:01:53.909> late<00:01:54.509> July

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
which we are in now to arm late July

which we are in now to arm late July
name<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> early<00:01:55.829> July<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.090> July<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
name in early July so first of July so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of course with ascension it was a couple

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.710 
of course with ascension it was a couple
of<00:02:09.599> months<00:02:09.720> after<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.530> arm<00:02:10.819> reaction<00:02:11.819> console

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
of months after the arm reaction console

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.550 
of months after the arm reaction console
release<00:02:13.050> date

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
release date

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.670 
release date
now<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:13.800> released<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.790> iOS<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.349> my<00:02:16.620> guess

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
now I'm released it for iOS so my guess

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
now I'm released it for iOS so my guess
is<00:02:17.130> they're<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:17.970> basically<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is they're going to do basically the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.490 
is they're going to do basically the
same<00:02:18.840> thing<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.470> them<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.810> iOS<00:02:21.810> version<00:02:21.840> for

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
same thing with them the iOS version for

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140 
same thing with them the iOS version for
call<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> dead<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.430> they're<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.000> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
call the dead so they're going to then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.839 
call the dead so they're going to then
release<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.959> couple<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.530> months<00:02:25.680> later<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.520> I

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
release it a couple of months later so I

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.870 
release it a couple of months later so I
would<00:02:27.599> say<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.319> released<00:02:28.890> somewhere<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
would say would be released somewhere in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.410 
would say would be released somewhere in
maybe<00:02:30.300> late<00:02:30.750> May<00:02:31.170> or<00:02:31.470> June<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> don't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
maybe late May or June because I don't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.050

so<00:02:57.209> going<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.799> means<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.519> um

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
so going on from this that means that um

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.500 
so going on from this that means that um
there<00:03:00.390> will<00:03:00.599> be<00:03:00.630> also<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.730> next<00:03:03.060> map<00:03:03.269> pack

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
there will be also a the next map pack

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.080 
there will be also a the next map pack
will<00:03:03.780> also<00:03:04.110> be<00:03:04.230> released<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:04.950> iOS<00:03:05.069> which<00:03:05.760> will

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
will also be released for iOS which will

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.140 
will also be released for iOS which will
be<00:03:06.470> shortly<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.830> from<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.400> called<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> dead

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
be shortly on from this called the dead

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.809 
be shortly on from this called the dead
map<00:03:09.450> pack<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.349> would<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.980> think<00:03:11.040> going

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
map pack so that would be I think going

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.059 
map pack so that would be I think going
on<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> annulation<00:03:12.599> map<00:03:13.110> pack<00:03:13.440> meaning<00:03:13.920> it'll

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
on the annulation map pack meaning it'll

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.580 
on the annulation map pack meaning it'll
have<00:03:14.370> shangri-la<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:15.870> something<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
have shangri-la in it or something so

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
have shangri-la in it or something so
that<00:03:16.860> could<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.609> bit<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.940> guess<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
that could be a bit of a guess as to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.440 
that could be a bit of a guess as to
what<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.170> next<00:03:19.380> map<00:03:19.799> pack<00:03:20.100> will<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:21.209> not

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
what the next map pack will be but not

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
what the next map pack will be but not
worrying<00:03:21.840> about<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.230> at<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> moment<00:03:22.680> guys

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
worrying about that at the moment guys

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.849 
worrying about that at the moment guys
sticking<00:03:23.820> with<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:25.320> console

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
sticking with this so the console

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.590 
sticking with this so the console
version<00:03:25.890> was<00:03:26.400> released<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> third<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
version was released on the third of the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.640 
version was released on the third of the
fifth<00:03:27.859> 2011<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> third<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.579> may<00:03:29.730> 2011<00:03:30.650> I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
fifth 2011 so the third of may 2011 I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.930 
fifth 2011 so the third of may 2011 I
would<00:03:32.489> guess<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.390> um<00:03:34.430> yes<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> said

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
would guess now that um yes as I said

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.420 
would guess now that um yes as I said
before<00:03:35.970> around<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> 13th<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.380> June<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.160> I
