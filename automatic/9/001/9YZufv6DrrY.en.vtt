00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
think that comes from millions of years
of<00:01:55.409> literally<00:01:56.159> talking<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:56.969> children

what<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> explains<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.070> why<00:01:59.460> there's<00:01:59.700> such<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
what this explains is why there's such a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
what this explains is why there's such a
difference<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> ask<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> woman<00:02:01.290> how<00:02:01.409> she

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
difference when you ask a woman how she

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
difference when you ask a woman how she
feels<00:02:01.920> versus<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> man<00:02:03.119> how<00:02:03.390> he<00:02:03.450> feels
