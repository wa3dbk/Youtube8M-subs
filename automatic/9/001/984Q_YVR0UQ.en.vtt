00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.469 
ok now for layout space exact same
procedure<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> layout<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.240> mine

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
procedure and go to layout I like mine

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.950 
procedure and go to layout I like mine
and<00:02:03.689> almost<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.340> yellowish<00:02:05.340> tinge<00:02:05.960> or

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and almost like a yellowish tinge or

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.979 
and almost like a yellowish tinge or
cream<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> guess<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.509> left<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
cream I guess so on the left here it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
cream I guess so on the left here it
automatically<00:02:10.500> put<00:02:10.830> us<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.370> spot

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
automatically put us in the right spot

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
automatically put us in the right spot
which<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:11.970> sheet<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.690> layout

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
which is sheet and layout

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
which is sheet and layout
now<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.370> these<00:02:14.610> from<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.030> but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
now you can do all of these from one but

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.940 
now you can do all of these from one but
by<00:02:15.690> switching<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.440> automatically

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
by switching to it it automatically

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100 
by switching to it it automatically
changes<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> color<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.270> active<00:02:18.780> screen

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
changes the color of your active screen

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.250 
changes the color of your active screen
so<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> little<00:02:20.340> easier<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.760> keep<00:02:20.910> track

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
so it's a little easier to keep track

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.780 
so it's a little easier to keep track
again<00:02:22.260> you're<00:02:22.440> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> go<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> uniform

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
again you're going to go to uniform

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.580 
again you're going to go to uniform
background<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.020> change<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> color

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
background and you can change the color

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.030 
background and you can change the color
to<00:02:25.830> whatever<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:27.800> typically<00:02:28.800> like

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
to whatever you like I typically like

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.610 
to whatever you like I typically like
something<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.170> paper

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
something that is kind of like paper

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.430 
something that is kind of like paper
colored<00:02:32.210> but<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.240> little<00:02:33.450> yellow<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
colored but a little yellow so I like

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.180 
colored but a little yellow so I like
something<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.770> that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
something like that

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770 
something like that
and<00:02:35.400> kind<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.300> bit<00:02:36.450> beige

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and kind of see it's a bit beige

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.560 
and kind of see it's a bit beige
compared<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.830> white<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:40.850> feel<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
compared to the white I feel like it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.470 
compared to the white I feel like it
makes<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> colors<00:02:43.260> pop<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.060> again

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
makes all the colors pop but again

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.560 
makes all the colors pop but again
