00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.590
 what we are going to do today are chiles 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.590
 cuaresmeño rellenos 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.910
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.910
 with the seed we are going to cut 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.120
 this is so that our 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.579
 Chile 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.269
 and we have to get closer little by little 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.930
 all the seeds 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.930
 the knife 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 if you like, you can wear gloves 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.550
 because they write useful things that are very 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 showy and they will know how to see the hands 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.680
 this is how it should be 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.680
 We're going to do this with all the peppers 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.009
 apart you must have already 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.009
 put a pot with water 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.940
 we have to add a spoonful of salt and 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.650
 we're going to let it boil while 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.440
 we clean our chiles 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.190
 that's how the chiles are left to know is that 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.190
 we are going to upset them 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.250
 he wins and writes 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.350
 they need to have the place ventilated 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.220
 because when they start 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.950
 boil the chiles will begin to chop the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.189
 nose let's start coughing 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.189

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.350
 in this that smooth 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.350
 the amount that you are going to choose 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.319
 the chiles are already what we are going to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.659
 to do is to start the 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.849
 and put them in a place where they run off 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.849
 very good for the soul of capel 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.400
 What we are going to do is 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.599
 the chiles 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.599

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.690
