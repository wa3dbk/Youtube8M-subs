00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
idea of what it looks like I just got it
the<00:00:21.060> other<00:00:21.150> day<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.360> have<00:00:21.539> used<00:00:21.780> it<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.200> see

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the other day I have used it you can see

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.580 
the other day I have used it you can see
some<00:00:22.590> brush<00:00:22.830> hairs<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.310> there<00:00:23.690> and<00:00:24.690> I<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.470> had

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
some brush hairs in there and I have had

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.640 
some brush hairs in there and I have had
a<00:00:25.650> sample<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.400> previously<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a sample of this previously but this is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.560 
a sample of this previously but this is
a<00:00:28.680> huge<00:00:29.160> container<00:00:29.610> to<00:00:30.029> give<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> an<00:00:30.449> idea

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
a huge container to give you an idea

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
a huge container to give you an idea
like<00:00:31.140> even<00:00:31.740> next<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.160> an<00:00:33.050> msf<00:00:34.050> from<00:00:34.469> Mac<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
like even next to an msf from Mac like a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.729 
like even next to an msf from Mac like a
look<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.109> the<00:00:37.109> other<00:00:37.260> difference<00:00:37.350> there

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
look at this the other difference there

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.149 
look at this the other difference there
so<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.089> is<00:00:39.120> huge<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.199> is<00:00:40.379> probably<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:41.039> to

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
so this is huge and is probably going to

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.250 
so this is huge and is probably going to
start<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.699> phones<00:00:41.879> gonna<00:00:42.059> probably<00:00:42.749> going<00:00:43.139> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
start my phones gonna probably going to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.540 
start my phones gonna probably going to

a much finer and smoother feel than the

a much finer and smoother feel than the
multiples<00:04:10.510> multiples<00:04:10.989> have<00:04:11.049> just<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.470> slight

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
multiples multiples have just a slight

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.060 
multiples multiples have just a slight
bit<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:13.510> wouldn't<00:04:14.109> say<00:04:14.260> graininess<00:04:14.709> but<00:04:15.040> i

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
bit of I wouldn't say graininess but i

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.120 
bit of I wouldn't say graininess but i
would<00:04:15.190> say<00:04:15.310> texture<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:17.169> those<00:04:17.919> are<00:04:18.100> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
would say texture to it so those are the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.270 
would say texture to it so those are the
main<00:04:18.370> differences<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.289> chanel<00:04:20.650> bronze

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
main differences but the chanel bronze

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.210 
main differences but the chanel bronze
universal<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.450> great<00:04:23.169> great<00:04:23.500> product<00:04:23.979> if

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
into it and just swirl it around with

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.379 
into it and just swirl it around with
the<00:04:33.499> multiples<00:04:34.009> I<00:04:34.340> kind<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.639> have<00:04:34.759> to<00:04:34.879> like<00:04:34.909> tap

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the multiples I kind of have to like tap

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.269 
the multiples I kind of have to like tap
the<00:04:35.569> brush<00:04:35.749> across<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.259> top<00:04:36.469> and<00:04:36.800> swirl<00:04:37.069> it<00:04:37.129> in

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279 
the brush across the top and swirl it in

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.249 
the brush across the top and swirl it in
a<00:04:37.340> little<00:04:37.699> bit<00:04:37.819> and<00:04:37.999> then<00:04:38.509> swirl<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.139> my

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
a little bit and then swirl it on my

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.779 
a little bit and then swirl it on my
hand<00:04:39.650> before<00:04:39.919> putting<00:04:40.219> it<00:04:40.340> directly<00:04:40.460> on<00:04:40.699> my

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
hand before putting it directly on my

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.489 
hand before putting it directly on my
face<00:04:40.999> because<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.810> doesn't<00:04:42.169> just<00:04:42.199> brush

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:42.499 
face because it doesn't just brush

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.709

properly<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.219> brush<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.539> definitely
