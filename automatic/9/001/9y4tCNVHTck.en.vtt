00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.670
 today this video as well 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.629
 you know today is Friday 20th February for it 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.980
 less for anyone 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.210
 logically he is watching this video e 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 its publication date e 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.150
 today what would have come out well the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.460
 road 1886 a video game I don't have 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.490
 bought and that I will not buy until then 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 which I did not consider it appropriate not 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 I say with this that the other is a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.410
 bad video game indeed I think the old 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 for anyone with a playstation 4 either 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 a video game to play a video game 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 to have because this because in my opinion 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 certainly offers a nice gameplay one 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 third person shooter that is based 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.840
 on good coverage shoots that shoots 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 somehow it can even remind me of gears 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 of war is in short it seems to me that it is me 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 always liked motorcycle via software 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 so why not even examine me 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.200
 proposes a gameplay but let's say in 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.520
 some way that comes close to that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.559
 video game is the time 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 since also in the aspect of the gays me 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 like all this also comes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.640
 enriched by a context of course 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.199
 very beautiful the 1886 wave magazine 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.219
 we say revisited in a modern key 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.049
 because surely we are in 1800 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.869
 1886 but they are introduced perhaps of the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.840
 weapons and technologies they could 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.240
 to have been present at the time but little 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 plausible to be seen as perhaps of the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 weapons are introduced if it was not a weapon 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.530
 created from time that takes advantage of the concept 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.299
 of electricity to hurl 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 of electrical smoke discharge 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.340
 they are practically against our enemies 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.100
 there are a series of objects that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.960
 maybe they could have thought of it 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.430
 at the time but definitely not not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.159
 conceived unrealized then we say 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.869
 an 1886 revised in a bit key 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.850
 I really like this futuristic but 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 I also really like how it all happened 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.939
 realized because if you talked not 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 only of graphics and therefore an aspect 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.649
 technical lighting reflected in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.299
 videogame and spectacular rendering 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.100
 of the settings and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.869
 just go and see maybe the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.670
 panorama landscapes buildings that there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 the structures are presented in front of them 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 houses the individual rooms we say 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 showman in a more more to the hand 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 fuck that cool fuck that cool because 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.940
 really really spectacular I have to 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.530
 say that 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.660
 I think of video games so beautiful 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.680
 currently on this generation there is no 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.870
 there are none 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.100
 I must say that he posed the hordes can put 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.440
 a little in light what are the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.060
 capacity perhaps of this playstation 4 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.890
 there are also aspects to charity 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.570
 what they have in my opinion is made possible 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 all this like putting black bands 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.070
 while playing so that the portion of 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.390
 rendered map is smaller for how much 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.040
 one can say no but more 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.420
 cinematic but I'm playing a 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.130
 video game I'm not watching a movie 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.750
 so the black bands make me a little bit 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.280
 then suck some of you 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.410
 like I don't know I don't like them 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.060
 however, having removed this, I must say that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 altogether theron and second is a 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.730
 nice video game a nice video game from 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 play but not now 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.040
 I'm a little reluctant about buying at 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.150
 launch of certain video games especially 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.550
 of those video games that I offer 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.110
 only a single play compartment 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.540
 single compartment pe and especially with one 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.460
 the other is somewhat questionable longevity 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.540
 how about how long it could take six 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.130
 seven hours 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.660
 tell her to take it right with 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.730
 invading canes makes her to stake 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.990
 around the map to see 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.790
 really every detail 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.740
 maybe I spend eight hours a longevity 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 however discrete especially for that 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.910
 that I go to pay on amazon it seems to me 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.660
 to have seen him 59.99 cents 60 euros 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.780
 8 hours 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.670
 no suitable for 7 hours 7 6 hours do not use them 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.200
 I would give but not because video game is not 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.700
 deserving of this money but for 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.590
 simple fact that I have to say that for 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.209
 spend all this money at launch 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.260
 for visco wait to wait when the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.880
 video game will cost less 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.430
 I have no problem buying me in a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.230
 future one used with punches in 3 4 months 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.760
 but she during the summer when one 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.840
 person produces longer cubes 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.090
 half price video game 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.250
 spend 30 euros for the other second 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 me is a just purchase for charity 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.130
 behind there is so much work and video game can 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.870
 be definitely worthy of under 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.670
 certain aspects but I want that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.110
 videogame that is long-lived today we are 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.720
 used to playing video games 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.450
 multiplayer that offer us days of 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.950
 I play not hours but also anyway 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.760
 removing perhaps those who are i 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.440
 multiplayer games 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.260
 there are single player video games 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 which also give us numerous hours of 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.020
 fun for example 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.590
 hate see you have been able to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.570
 make video games like skyrim 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.420
 fallout that I am able to stay with 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.550
 let us be so glued 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.440
 in front of us that intricate sentences 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.870
 in short, they also offer us more than 100 hours 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.270
 of gameplay but it is not only not only the b 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.130
 also test the square enix and the square 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.810
 soft with the video games they made 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.470
 They are making the final saga 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.330
 Fantasy 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 I expect for example the fantasy one 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.350
 15 with more than 100 hours of play though 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.880
 remembering what I am experiencing 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.950
 with the previous final fantasy in short 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.390
 they are video games and there are video games 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.430
 single play can offer one 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.110
 really very important longevity that 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.380
 they can also be simply 25 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.300
 hours 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.740
 we are not talking about 100 ma 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.390
 however longevity that justifies me 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.270
 purchase at launch for 60 euros of a 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.950
 nice game the order spend 60 euros 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.360
 so for me they are a bit too many ie 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.730
 now tell me we will have all hired 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.380
 from bread for love maybe you could 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.180
 even think about buying it with those 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.270
 however sincerely however keep record from 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.890
 part trades in something else maybe 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.300
 one of the reasons why he has ever 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.800
 really wanted to buy at launch 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.130
 it would have been the one to realize 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.980
 channel pictures on this channel 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.260
 video game maybe with what he could 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.940
 maybe be two or three themed videos by 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.440
 this video game certainly yes but 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.210
 in my opinion all this continues not 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.340
 be enough to tell me if I go to 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.520
 buy at the game console launch well 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.410
 56 santa is a no customer for me though 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.450
 it's too big and I do n't know but not 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.370
 I think I think even though the thought of 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.440
 some vaud and then you as you have 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.820
 reacted this de gold in my opinion is a 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 video game to play that you have to 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.750
 take your pad in your pad 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.520
 affixed here because they studied me 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.500
 all of us high take your pad 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.380
 turn on our console and play with it 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.260
 all this, however, at what price a game 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.230
 single player games with longevity 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.050
 so questionable in my opinion do not deserve 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.460
 to be bought for 60 euros is a bit 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.350
 insult to our time and to the 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.490
 our money for how much video game it is 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.840
 beautiful not 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.759
 I also want to on the kill he made 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.280
 because the video game looks nice to me but 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.330
 not so from from as I already said from 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.319
 this being this from your lance 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.699
 so what do you think 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.250
 by the way, bring me down here 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.690
 a comment with your impressions if 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.460
 you bought it if you buy it 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.039
 later if you don't care if you feel that 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.690
 be a game of pentium deco 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.400
 perfectly free to write below what 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.710
 that you also want to have it are reggina 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.449
 spend 60 euros like scialacqua cha 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.430
 aka strip the firm that 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.020
 you want below as usual are the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.699
 vast 90 if you enjoyed this

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:35.909
 very important for me but also for you 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.440
 it's not only true for me as usual 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.360
