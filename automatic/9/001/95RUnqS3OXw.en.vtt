00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
little cold in the morning

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
little cold in the morning
so<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> usually<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> afternoon

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so I usually have them in the afternoon

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.130 
so I usually have them in the afternoon
which<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.979> am<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.700> warmest<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.689> when

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
which is when I am the warmest and when

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.310 
which is when I am the warmest and when
the<00:01:52.229> temperature<00:01:52.649> tends<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> warmest

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the temperature tends to be the warmest

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.350

so<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.530> cutting<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.460> skin<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so I'm just cutting the skin off of that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
so I'm just cutting the skin off of that
ginger<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.200> cutting<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.490> chunks

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
ginger and cutting it into little chunks

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.020
