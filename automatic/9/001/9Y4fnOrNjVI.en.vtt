the side release buckle and then you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380 
the side release buckle and then you
have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> dry<00:00:25.949> bag<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> coolest

have a dry bag one of the coolest

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
have a dry bag one of the coolest
features<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.140> bag<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
features about this bag is that that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
features about this bag is that that
differentiates<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.449> classic<00:00:31.109> dry<00:00:31.320> bags

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
differentiates it from classic dry bags

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.310 
differentiates it from classic dry bags
is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.700> dry<00:00:33.030> bag<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.540> point<00:00:33.840> would<00:00:34.260> be

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
is a dry bag at this point would be

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
is a dry bag at this point would be
static<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> couldn't<00:00:35.370> compress<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.270> any

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
static you couldn't compress it any

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.090 
static you couldn't compress it any
further<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.960> none<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> air<00:00:37.800> would<00:00:38.070> be

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
further because none of the air would be

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
further because none of the air would be
able<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> escape<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:39.390> happens<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> when

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
able to escape what happens is when

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.090 
able to escape what happens is when
you're<00:00:40.079> trying<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> pack<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> into<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> tight

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you're trying to pack it into a tight

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729 
you're trying to pack it into a tight
space<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> backpack<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.510> kayak<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.379> end

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
space like a backpack or kayak you end

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
space like a backpack or kayak you end
up<00:00:43.800> having<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> wasted<00:00:44.760> space<00:00:44.789> without

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
up having a lot of wasted space without

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
up having a lot of wasted space without
being<00:00:45.660> able<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> compress<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> bag<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.550> we

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
being able to compress the bag so we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
being able to compress the bag so we
added<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.149> layer<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> fabric<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> base

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
added a layer of fabric here at the base

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.340 
added a layer of fabric here at the base
this<00:00:50.219> orange<00:00:50.610> ring<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.449> both<00:00:51.780> waterproof

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this orange ring it's both waterproof

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.400 
this orange ring it's both waterproof
and<00:00:52.980> air<00:00:53.789> permeable<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.809> means<00:00:54.989> it'll<00:00:55.170> keep

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and air permeable that means it'll keep

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.160 
and air permeable that means it'll keep
water<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.000> lets<00:00:57.420> air<00:00:57.719> pass

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
water out but it also lets air pass

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
water out but it also lets air pass
through<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.949> bag<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.940> compress

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
through the bag so that you can compress

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
through the bag so that you can compress
the<00:01:00.570> bag<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.109> change<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> dimension<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the bag and change the dimension of it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
the bag and change the dimension of it
in<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.059> fully<00:01:03.300> dry<00:01:03.629> configuration<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
in a fully dry configuration and a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
in a fully dry configuration and a
really<00:01:05.430> interesting<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.630> that's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really interesting way to see how that's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
really interesting way to see how that's
demonstrated<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> piece<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
demonstrated as we can take a piece of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
demonstrated as we can take a piece of
that<00:01:08.939> fabric<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.470> little

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that fabric and put it in this little

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.320 
that fabric and put it in this little
container<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.280> called<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.520> bubbler<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> we

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
container here called the bubbler and we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
container here called the bubbler and we
can<00:01:12.479> pour<00:01:12.659> water<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.200> top<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.310> see

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
can pour water on top and you can see

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
can pour water on top and you can see
that<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:16.080> water<00:01:16.350> doesn't<00:01:16.710> pass<00:01:17.009> through<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that the water doesn't pass through the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240 
that the water doesn't pass through the
fabric<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> waterproof<00:01:18.780> fabric<00:01:19.380> but

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
fabric so it's a waterproof fabric but

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.359 
fabric so it's a waterproof fabric but
what<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.570> pass<00:01:22.259> air<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
what you can do is pass air through the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
what you can do is pass air through the
bottom<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> great<00:01:24.810> demonstration

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
bottom so this is a great demonstration

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
bottom so this is a great demonstration
of<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.619> happens<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> start<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> compress

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
of what happens as you start to compress

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
of what happens as you start to compress
this<00:01:27.299> bag<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.170> air<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.680> flows<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.610> out

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this bag the air just flows right out

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
this bag the air just flows right out
through<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.180> orange<00:01:30.509> fabric<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
through this orange fabric the way that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
through this orange fabric the way that
you<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> pull<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.880> these<00:01:33.030> straps

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you do that is you pull on these straps

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
you do that is you pull on these straps
here<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> side<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.650> nice<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> start<00:01:35.189> with

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
here on the side it's nice to start with

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
here on the side it's nice to start with
alternate<00:01:36.000> straps<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> pull

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
alternate straps and just kind of pull

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
alternate straps and just kind of pull
them<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.350> together<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.939> take

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
them down together and you can take

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
them down together and you can take
something<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:40.200> bulky<00:01:40.470> item<00:01:40.920> for

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.609 
mountaineering trip for the final I like
to<00:01:47.970> turn<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> upside<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.630> give<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> little

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to turn it upside down give a little

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
to turn it upside down give a little
push<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> bottom<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.790> tug<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
push on the bottom and tug on all the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
push on the bottom and tug on all the
straps<00:01:51.930> independently<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
straps independently so you can take a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.580 
straps independently so you can take a
really<00:01:53.970> large<00:01:54.299> load<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.960> compress<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.439> down

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
really large load and compress it down

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
really large load and compress it down
and<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> stay<00:01:56.579> reliably<00:01:57.060> compressed

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and have it stay reliably compressed

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.170 
and have it stay reliably compressed
while<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.229> load<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> into<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.250> kayak<00:01:59.640> catch<00:01:59.850> for

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
while you load it into a kayak catch for

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
while you load it into a kayak catch for
instance<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.990> other<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> features<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
instance one other of the features that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.609 
instance one other of the features that
I<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.369> enjoy<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> packs<00:02:04.110> into<00:02:04.380> its

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
I really enjoy is how it packs into its

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.980 
I really enjoy is how it packs into its
own<00:02:04.860> stuff<00:02:05.340> sack<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.820> inside<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.810> also

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
own stuff sack on the inside it also

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.219 
own stuff sack on the inside it also
doubles<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.799> its<00:02:08.340> own<00:02:08.610> internal<00:02:09.509> bag<00:02:09.810> for

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
doubles as its own internal bag for

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
doubles as its own internal bag for
smaller<00:02:10.590> items<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.090> keeps<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.450> your

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
smaller items so that keeps all your

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.180 
smaller items so that keeps all your
critical

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
critical

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.040 
critical
right<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.790> at<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> top<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.600> reason<00:02:14.900> why<00:02:15.020> I

right here at the top the reason why I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.380 
right here at the top the reason why I
love<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.590> bag<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.160> fuses<00:02:16.580> two<00:02:16.760> concepts

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
love this bag is it fuses two concepts

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.020 
love this bag is it fuses two concepts
the<00:02:17.750> traditional<00:02:18.290> dry<00:02:18.530> bag<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the traditional dry bag and the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.690 
the traditional dry bag and the
compression<00:02:20.480> bag<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.040> way<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> put

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
compression bag so that way when you put

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.400 
compression bag so that way when you put
these<00:02:22.970> two<00:02:23.180> together<00:02:23.270> you're<00:02:23.870> ready<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.290> your

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
these two together you're ready for your

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.770 
these two together you're ready for your
next<00:02:24.620> adventure
