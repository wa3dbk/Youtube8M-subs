00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 more need than korea 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.970
 the program a little session but nothing to do with the heavy preparation 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 physical who just endured 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.839
 I am saying 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.640
 this interview m 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.979
 nw 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.389
 it's very hard for me it suffered a lot it's true I think the 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.060
 time does it matter which team that is a little 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.550
 I want to let go during the holidays for the movement that has taken 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.950
 good holiday what is remarkable yes sir 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.080
 for this meeting 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.820
 he held up we said he worked last Sunday the two 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880
 championship's best attack by a very delicate move on the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.850
 lawn of liverpool 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 it is first steven gerrard who welcomes the Moroccans 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.600
 November 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.770
 feat 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 but haas it's the first football lesson like that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 for now I have never felt much better 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.550
 I know it's like that everywhere all the time to register 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.680
 far from being impressed the effect of a small roulette stolen from his friend yoann 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 gourcuff 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 really 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.290
 I said to myself oh 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.530
 in the room is whether to take into account 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.510
 when she is so far it's good that I do not know what it is 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.550
 but chamakh and especially on time 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.750
 equalizer at the last minute following this hand foul of reina 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.440
 arsene wenger is thrilled with his new player 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.040
 I this illegitimate regime 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.810
 young people altruism 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.180
 it's a form of a very rare attacker because these jewels for them 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.409
 others he does not play at the river put the others in value 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.770
 martel have integrated 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 the number 29 has still kept his shin guards Girondins 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.709
 what happens in a second round 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.479
 mystic falls 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.829
 sticky products 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.309
 ah yes yes yes 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.489
 that's why we're just a little nod to his old club 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.960
 sanofi what patrice so that there was still a few hours following the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.039
 ccclb a bit of his image it's true that that's not always the case 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.079
 something tells us that payment is fun 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.109
 yesterday is the co-leader of the championship and the first of the hen who moves 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.060
 among Londoners 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.280
 from the 12th minute and the national team head then the visitors 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.670
 arshavine serwa side 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.670
 for the first issue 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.009
 this one rosicky quillan chamakh 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.820
 in front of these basses 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.669
 penalty and red card 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.169
 arshavine are responsible for doubling the brand 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.779
 dunga men wandered theo walcott sparkling brand again 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 3 to 0 at half time 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.099
 it's then a 100% French goal with bacary sagna on his right side that 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.099
 center for the perfect diaby recovery 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.369
 then 5 with a treble of walcott his first in the first half 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.159
 marouane chamakh is close to register his first official goal but 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.939
 he completely misses his recovery 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.939
 he redeems himself at the very end of the match following this corner 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.679
 for this first at home happiness shared with his supporters who 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:42.520
 just arises 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.829
 only one question 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.829
 the unrwa no longer had to become an arsenal legend 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:53.080
 but for me what I know I start to find his game while it's possible 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.080
 I never folded 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.589
 so hp france 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:00.089
 frankly if it's specified
