00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
war now with me thinking about all of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.079 
war now with me thinking about all of
this<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.549> I<00:00:59.610> don't<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
this not a thing but I don't think it

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.299 
this not a thing but I don't think it
does<00:01:00.239> i<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.659> comes<00:01:00.839> out<00:01:00.989> um<00:01:01.199> later<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.280> i

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
does i think it comes out um later on i

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.930 
does i think it comes out um later on i
think<00:01:02.549> was<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> winter<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.190> regards

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
think was it winter so in that regards

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.570 
think was it winter so in that regards
math<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.650> doesn't<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.190> work<00:01:08.370> but

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
math you know it doesn't really work but

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.430 
math you know it doesn't really work but
this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.060> speculation<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.320> how

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
this is more speculation so this is how

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.370 
this is more speculation so this is how
they<00:01:10.620> could<00:01:10.979> use<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.549> Sinister<00:01:12.119> Six<00:01:12.149> film<00:01:12.600> as

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
they could use the Sinister Six film as

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.910 
they could use the Sinister Six film as
a<00:01:13.439> bridge<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.829> the<00:01:14.039> savour<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.969> MCU

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
a bridge to the savour and to the MCU

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
a bridge to the savour and to the MCU
think<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> Sinister

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
think about this what if the Sinister

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
think about this what if the Sinister
Six<00:01:18.420> film<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> bigger<00:01:20.159> reason<00:01:20.430> for

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Six film would be a bigger reason for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.130 
Six film would be a bigger reason for
them<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.539> this<00:01:21.719> this<00:01:22.219> registration<00:01:23.219> act

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
them to have this this registration act

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.539 
them to have this this registration act
because<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.039> have<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.399> of
