the<00:00:44.210> disk<00:00:45.210> image<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.050> record

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the disk image you get one like record

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.990 
the disk image you get one like record
over<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> drag<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.670> over<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:47.969> your

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
over you have to drag it over with your

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.029 
over you have to drag it over with your
application<00:00:48.180> folder<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.680> probably<00:00:49.920> one

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
application folder that's probably one

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
application folder that's probably one
of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> reason<00:00:50.550> why<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.730> cannot<00:00:51.210> play<00:00:51.360> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of the reason why you cannot play it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
of the reason why you cannot play it
because<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.800> directly<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.250> their<00:00:53.460> not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because you do directly from their not

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
because you do directly from their not
from<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.149> folder<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
from your folder so if that's one of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
from your folder so if that's one of
that<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> issues<00:00:56.579> try<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.660> see

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

itself<00:02:27.450> does<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.230> problem<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.010> with

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
itself does this problem here with

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.130 
itself does this problem here with
because<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.510> know<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.780> recording

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because kind of you know I'm recording

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.090 
because kind of you know I'm recording
with<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:32.120> stream<00:02:33.120> flow<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
with a stream flow you know it's a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.620 
with a stream flow you know it's a
taking<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.160> lot<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.550> processor<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.270> shit

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
taking a lot of the processor and shit

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.040 
taking a lot of the processor and shit
fuck<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> shit<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:39.410> what<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.739> or<00:02:40.819> what<00:02:42.050> but
