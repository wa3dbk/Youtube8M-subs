00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.280
 now let's see again what 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.350
 He mentioned a new video and I know 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.070
 went back to work again in greeting 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.460
 when the day does not do it 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.460
 very weird 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.500
 welcome to a new video very 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.900
 different my channel that is like a half 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 gameplay more or less but it's a game 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.480
 it's called galaxy life poker 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 adventures for android cell which is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 which in which I am able to capture 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 the screen finally cost me more too 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 He consulted me as he does not have a unit 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.269
 It cost a lot but we're already here 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.460
 is this what makes me market message 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:05.830
 thank you very much this and the first one that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.250
 like a lot and it's like this is 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.840
 strategy roughly tries to make 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.759
 you have to build your own 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.979
 civilization to say it of some 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.100
 way and defend yourself against others from 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.689
 civilizations by means of troops 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.490
 campan this training camp 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.200
 which is like this for example and here already 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.070
 you can create various troops as per 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.929
 marine example the flamethrower flamethrower 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.009
 bazuca kamikaze and the estadi reader 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:36.640
 because this beetle plan or the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.140
 cursor mole colossus and already the most 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.509
 advanced that will come being these are 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.580
 the the wasp 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.030
 the UFO vacuum cleaner and I hope that the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.380
 advice to him they ask very well this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.170
 game I like much more time in 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.729
 the theme of how is that is like a 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.890
 war are like where futurists and 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.659
 they are very armed look for example let's 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.649
 see what we bother look at this guy that 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.649
 here finishing that look 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230
 and he ran 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.440
 but not only that but to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.200
 build the buildings reached a 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 star level is the most building 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 important the starbase because because 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.120
 is the starbase is like your center of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 I do not know how to say it as high is not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500
 something like that in any that protect the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.540
 which gives more experience this when 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.820
 have a level more or less be good 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 you will be able to build this that is 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.020
 observatory this once built 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.510
 here I always say this you will not be able 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.730
 build another colony that in this case 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.610
 it would be like another planet that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.290
 you can go to connect to record and good 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.670
 we will wait to apply ghetto 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.200
 and why do I do this review because good 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.090
 really many not many people 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.650
 true because they are not many but in the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 channel all like five people six 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 people who like this game that is 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 legislates right to the corts and for that reason and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.700
 good is the mobile version of the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.440
 version for counters on facebook but 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.450
 good prints are going to take more time 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.980
 because it requires more good things this one 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.480
 As you can see there is a lot of experience in 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 the other planet in this as a little more 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.070
 poor is what I want, not good 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.390
 but it's the same this is a clear 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.220
 example of how you start companies from 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.600
 poch and a little bit of to present improvements 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.610
 this so that it becomes this size 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.950
 you have the money and we do not have 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.210
 workers available in all these 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.640
 subjects with these marcianitos with 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.980
 caps is a very good game is 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.130
 example of the repeat is not available 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.470
 In Google Play Google In Google Play Off 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 play and as he wants to say this is 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 quite entertaining is something addictive the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.310
 true if the very addictive mitres of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.240
 game but it's good they have fun if 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.240
 have you had a good time 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.700
 and good that the same tutorial and then 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.370
 good if you want we can be like that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.290
 that allies and adds me as a friend as 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.049
 you add me as a good friend as a user 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.049
 as a friend as is good if this loads 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 on this date you are watching 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.020
 up on this side 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.790
 are these two little aliens 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.880
 extraterrestrial what is called here and 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.130
 you're going to give in friends later on to add 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.890
 friends and here you will appear for 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.690
 put a code this friend code 9 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.610
 30 12 15 19 845 that's my code of 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.730
 friend we're just going to have to give in 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.070
 one of the blank steps you are going to add 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.260
 the number that of friend the one that is of 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.510
 anybody then added to any and 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.490
 well it would be all in fact agreement in 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.900
 how much friends would be everything and I tell them 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.000
 theme of the game is very good in itself 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.730
 you have to make your planet grow and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.470
 you can attack other civilizations 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.560
 as you can see I'm here I have what 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.780
 I sell some this one troops that are 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.200
 beetle tanks here I have seven 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.020
 tanks jobs and a cursor I have other 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.800

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.800
 yes no 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:13.030
 I'm on a bridge to do this calculation 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.800
