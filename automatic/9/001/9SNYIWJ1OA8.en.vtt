I'm<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> show<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.899> unwrap

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I'm going to show how to how we unwrap

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.899 
I'm going to show how to how we unwrap
them<00:01:05.510> generally<00:01:06.510> when<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.990> they're<00:01:07.140> wrapped

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
them generally when when they're wrapped

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
them generally when when they're wrapped
they<00:01:08.909> leave<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.270> end<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
they leave an end that's just kind of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
they leave an end that's just kind of
hanging<00:01:11.040> loose<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
hanging loose here and it's kind of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.580 
hanging loose here and it's kind of
stuck<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:14.790> come<00:01:15.060> unwrapped

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
stuck in so they don't come unwrapped

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
stuck in so they don't come unwrapped
but<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> unwrap<00:01:17.850> these

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
but are you going to unwrap these

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.020 
but are you going to unwrap these
basically<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.020> got<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> find<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.590> thing

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
basically just got to find this thing

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
basically just got to find this thing
can<00:01:21.030> yank<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> off<00:01:22.970> all<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.750> lot

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
can yank it off all the way down a lot

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
can yank it off all the way down a lot
of<00:01:25.650> times<00:01:25.830> they're<00:01:26.009> covered<00:01:26.310> nice<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.630> just
