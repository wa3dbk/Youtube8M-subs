00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:05.279
 The current local rally invites you to share this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.530
 We thank all those who collaborated to make it possible 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.279
 The proposal can be trained in guidance and process reference 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.169
 humans 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.240
 learning to show a difficult path 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.220
 and developing according to others the best we have inside of us 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 anna 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.079
 we teach all kinds of things except the essential 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.710
 what is life 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.110
 nobody teach us anything about life 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.850
 you're supposed to know 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 everyone assumes that it is something that we should have acquired by osmosis 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.370
 there are no school subjects that deal with topics like I think today 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 For this task 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.720
 if you keep putting the accent on the wrong chair 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.040
 reading spelling math etc 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.980
 but they do not teach us how to become a human 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.530
 if our interest as educators 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.280
 is to go transforming coordinators and organizers 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.610
 to see of wounded referents and counselors of human processes 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 surely 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 our students will begin to wonder 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.960
 who I am 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.450
 for this story 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.480
 will then begin to wonder about the meaning of life 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 the work of a teacher of an instructor and of importance 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.420
 but in times of urgency the work of a reference is the most important 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.620
 we all know that we are fast approaching a global crisis 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.510
 we also know that all reference is being lost is a serious moment 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 similar to the moment before a shipwreck 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840
 the world is in darkness and needs references 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.810
 In this situation, teachers must become a reference 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.990
 being at this point important to highlight the differences between sir a 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 matter and show a path of experience 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.150
 becoming a reference surely implies another sensitivity 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.379
 and that is the one of a deeper understanding 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.760
 there is a closer relationship with the human condition 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.879
 with those of us who work 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
 with those who influence 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:30.059
 our profession as educators is a work oriented to the change of 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:35.669
 attitudes and behaviors a job required orientation and meaning 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.619
 of life in general 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:43.909
 it is a work in order destined to the humanity in a field it needed to forge 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.969
 tools that give a new meaning to the existence 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.410
 remembering that we always take this road we do not have any right to 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.759
 demand that we understand 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.589
 Conversely 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.469
 we have the responsibility 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.469
 eastern simpler to be combat 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.799
 we must replace in our daily deal the explanation for the 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.839
 orientation fundamentally from the attitude itself 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.040
 we will be making a real change, not an individual change 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.989
 without a change that is projected to the social 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 along with others who have made the same decision 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.789
 if you want to communicate computer 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.379
 with 52 40 80 the cinema 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.310
 with the teacher 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.929
 against 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.160
 we said goodbye 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.090
 we remind you that this is a space of the current educators unites 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.040
 We count to build 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.200
 education in the entity
