00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.320
 Lake Weiwan in the heart of the Mediterranean Atlas 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 This location is 68 km from Khenifra 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680
 And at a height of 1600 meters 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.160
 The eye and flow of resources that feed the lake, 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.000
 It covers an area of â€‹â€‹17.5 hectares and houses an important fish, animal and plant wealth 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.240
 Yuwan Lake is dying 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.280
 On the one hand the abundance of algae 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.480
 On the other hand, the garbage resulting from indiscriminate camping 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 Unless what can be salvaged before it is too late 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.720
 Will inevitably lead to the depletion of existing aquatic organisms 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 It is a quiet and quiet area for lovers of nature, tranquility and tranquility
