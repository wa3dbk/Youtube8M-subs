00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.050 

okay<00:01:59.490> of<00:02:00.300> course<00:02:01.970> we've<00:02:02.970> got<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
okay of course we've got here this is

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.109 
okay of course we've got here this is
the<00:02:06.300> cork<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.160> showed<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.490> perform<00:02:08.880> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the cork and I showed you perform this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.740 
the cork and I showed you perform this
head<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> cork<00:02:09.660> comes<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.860> people<00:02:11.130> roll<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
head of cork comes and people roll and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.500 
head of cork comes and people roll and
just<00:02:12.930> basically<00:02:13.290> lots<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.860> cork<00:02:14.270> bedding<00:02:15.270> like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
just basically lots of cork bedding like

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
just basically lots of cork bedding like
that<00:02:16.070> as<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:19.410> over<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> profile

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that as you can see the over the profile

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100 
that as you can see the over the profile
comes<00:02:20.430> quite<00:02:20.670> square<00:02:20.970> that's<00:02:21.570> because<00:02:21.960> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
comes quite square that's because this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
comes quite square that's because this
roll<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.410> essentially<00:02:23.040> split<00:02:23.400> down<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
roll is essentially split down the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.090 
roll is essentially split down the
middle<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.900> saw<00:02:25.140> before<00:02:25.290> I'd<00:02:25.620> split<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
middle so you saw before I'd split the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880 
middle so you saw before I'd split the
cork<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> court<00:02:27.450> comes<00:02:27.720> actually<00:02:28.440> out

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
cork so how the court comes actually out

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.090 
cork so how the court comes actually out
comes<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> people<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.730> buy<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> from

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
comes from the people I buy it from

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
comes from the people I buy it from
actually<00:02:32.100> I'm<00:02:32.220> pretty<00:02:32.430> sure<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> comes<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
actually I'm pretty sure it comes in a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.060 
actually I'm pretty sure it comes in a
you<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.510> release<00:02:33.900> box<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.890> roll

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you know release box but they just roll

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.060 
you know release box but they just roll
it<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.330> cheap<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it up for that so it's that cheap it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.260 
it up for that so it's that cheap it
cheaper<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:40.350> send<00:02:40.770> by<00:02:41.130> post<00:02:43.100> so
