year<00:00:19.300> well<00:00:20.300> there<00:00:20.600> are<00:00:20.660> lots<00:00:20.870> of<00:00:21.050> challenges

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
year well there are lots of challenges

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.070 
year well there are lots of challenges
in<00:00:21.830> first<00:00:22.250> in<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.610> hardware<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.600> hardware

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
in first in the hardware the hardware

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.960 
in first in the hardware the hardware
has<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:24.410> be<00:00:24.590> very<00:00:24.860> very<00:00:25.100> robust<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.820> high

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
has to be very very robust and high

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.000 
has to be very very robust and high
performance<00:00:26.140> which<00:00:27.140> we<00:00:27.410> believe<00:00:27.740> we<00:00:27.980> have

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
performance which we believe we have

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.950 
performance which we believe we have
achieved<00:00:28.280> and<00:00:28.790> we<00:00:29.120> are<00:00:29.240> very<00:00:29.270> very<00:00:29.480> happy

achieved and we are very very happy

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.010 
achieved and we are very very happy
about<00:00:30.050> another<00:00:30.650> new<00:00:30.950> tech<00:00:31.190> the<00:00:32.180> in<00:00:32.540> on<00:00:32.689> task

about another new tech the in on task

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.919 
about another new tech the in on task
remaining<00:00:33.649> is<00:00:33.980> just<00:00:34.280> completed<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.030> second

remaining is just completed the second
on<00:00:36.140> top<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:37.010> will<00:00:37.219> provide<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.699> great

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
on top of that it will provide the great

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.540 
on top of that it will provide the great
illness<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.839> platform<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.949> support<00:00:40.129> the

game developers to create great

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.560 
game developers to create great
experiences<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.159> how<00:00:43.940> they<00:00:44.089> are<00:00:44.179> great<00:00:44.390> how

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
experiences and how they are great how

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.349 
experiences and how they are great how
there<00:00:44.749> is<00:00:44.839> not<00:00:45.109> enough<00:00:45.530> because<00:00:45.739> software<00:00:46.460> you

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
there is not enough because software you

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.079 
there is not enough because software you
know<00:00:47.420> because<00:00:47.719> VR<00:00:48.199> is<00:00:48.800> such<00:00:49.159> a<00:00:49.190> challenging<00:00:49.819> in

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
know because VR is such a challenging in

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.840 
know because VR is such a challenging in
a<00:00:50.239> new<00:00:50.449> medium<00:00:50.690> that<00:00:51.379> developers<00:00:51.949> all<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.640> them

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
a new medium that developers all of them

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.709 
a new medium that developers all of them
have<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.449> learn<00:00:53.719> how<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.199> design<00:00:55.100> around<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
have to learn how to design around the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.709 
have to learn how to design around the
new<00:00:57.679> you<00:00:58.100> know<00:00:58.249> paradigm<00:00:58.729> so<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.390> people

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
new you know paradigm so that people

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.139 
new you know paradigm so that people
have<00:00:59.839> great<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:00.350> know<00:01:00.379> VR<00:01:00.829> experiences<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
have great you know VR experiences so

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.450 
have great you know VR experiences so
that<00:01:02.179> it<00:01:02.870> takes<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.499> lot<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.679> learning<00:01:04.250> on

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
that it takes a lot of learning on

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.490 
that it takes a lot of learning on
communication<00:01:05.330> with<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.630> report<00:01:06.020> that's<00:01:06.320> a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
communication with the report that's a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.770 
communication with the report that's a
second<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.490> know<00:01:07.610> challenge<00:01:07.969> and<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.570> third

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
second you know challenge and the third

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.620 
second you know challenge and the third
challenge<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.469> to<00:01:09.799> communicate<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.909> consumers

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
challenge is to communicate to consumers

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.469 
challenge is to communicate to consumers
because<00:01:12.350> before<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.280> know<00:01:13.399> until<00:01:14.060> you'd<00:01:14.240> be<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
because before you know until you'd be a

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.749 
because before you know until you'd be a
try<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.229> don't<00:01:15.469> understand<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.430> know<00:01:16.579> what

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
try you don't understand you know what

nones<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.550> comes<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:42.940> VR<00:01:43.210> one<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
nones when it comes to VR one of the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.170 
nones when it comes to VR one of the
things<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:43.990> oculus<00:01:44.950> has<00:01:45.310> continually<00:01:45.850> told

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
things that oculus has continually told

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.540 
things that oculus has continually told
me<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.710> they're<00:01:47.710> waiting<00:01:48.100> until<00:01:48.370> it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
me is that they're waiting until it's

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.280 
me is that they're waiting until it's
absolutely<00:01:48.730> perfect<00:01:49.360> because<00:01:49.870> you<00:01:49.990> kind<00:01:50.230> of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
absolutely perfect because you kind of

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.460 
absolutely perfect because you kind of
only<00:01:50.440> have<00:01:50.710> one<00:01:50.980> shot<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.550> win<00:01:51.850> people<00:01:52.210> over

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
only have one shot to win people over

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.260 
only have one shot to win people over
can<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.500> get<00:01:53.680> your<00:01:53.830> thoughts<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.250> yeah<00:01:55.090> we

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
can I get your thoughts on that yeah we

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.580 
can I get your thoughts on that yeah we
really<00:01:55.570> would<00:01:55.720> not<00:01:55.870> want<00:01:56.050> people<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.410> have<00:01:56.530> a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
really would not want people to have a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.160 
really would not want people to have a
first<00:01:56.890> experience<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.490> was<00:01:57.610> bad<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.180> BR<00:01:58.480> so<00:01:58.870> I

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
first experience that was bad in BR so I

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.730 
first experience that was bad in BR so I
think<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.880> feel<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:01.840> threshold<00:02:02.410> our

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
think we feel that this threshold our

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620 
think we feel that this threshold our
hardware<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.220> hit<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.580> really<00:02:03.910> where<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.600> want

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
hardware is hit is really where we want

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.500 
hardware is hit is really where we want

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
consumer level that we think people can

problem with the 3d TV gaming was you

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.430 
problem with the 3d TV gaming was you
know<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.890> created<00:05:26.400> some<00:05:26.430> depth<00:05:27.090> inside<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.230> TV

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
pretty much the same because every game

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.519 
pretty much the same because every game
3d<00:05:33.570> TVs<00:05:34.260> to

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
information that is necessary needed to

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.789
