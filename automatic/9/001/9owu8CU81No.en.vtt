00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
cpu device now one really special thing

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.520 
cpu device now one really special thing
here<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.090> can<00:02:04.240> show<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.960> this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
here that we can show you is that this

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.859 
here that we can show you is that this
is<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.920> rockchip<00:02:06.450> rk3188<00:02:07.470> chip<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:09.640> why<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
is the rockchip rk3188 chip now why this

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.630 
is the rockchip rk3188 chip now why this
is<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.050> quad-core<00:02:11.319> chip<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.190> why<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.520> so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
is a quad-core chip the why is it so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.870 
is a quad-core chip the why is it so
special<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:14.459> basically<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.819> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
special it's because basically this is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
special it's because basically this is
going<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> clock<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.630> about<00:02:16.720> 1.8<00:02:17.410> giga

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
going to clock in at about 1.8 giga

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.670 
going to clock in at about 1.8 giga
hertz<00:02:18.420> making<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> faster<00:02:19.690> than<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
hertz making it faster than like the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.180 
hertz making it faster than like the
allwinner<00:02:21.010> a10<00:02:21.730> t<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> are<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.650> 20<00:02:24.180> t

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
allwinner a10 t so I are a 20 t

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
allwinner a10 t so I are a 20 t
octa-core<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.610> also<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> mtk6592<00:02:28.989> CPU<00:02:31.170> ok

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
octa-core and also the mtk6592 CPU ok

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.320 
octa-core and also the mtk6592 CPU ok
now<00:02:32.410> let's<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.860> show<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.760> rest<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
now let's just show you the rest of the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.100 
now let's just show you the rest of the
ports<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.019> device<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.600> actually<00:02:37.600> you

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
ports on this device so actually you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.780 
ports on this device so actually you
cannot<00:02:38.440> let<00:02:38.950> me<00:02:39.010> zoom<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.580> little<00:02:39.700> bit

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
cannot let me zoom in just a little bit

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.020 
cannot let me zoom in just a little bit
more<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.010> see<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.400> has<00:02:45.430> Kingston

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
more so you can see that it has Kingston

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.600 
more so you can see that it has Kingston
memory

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.580 

so<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.270> look<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> samsung<00:02:52.170> chip

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
so this look like this is a samsung chip

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.770 
so this look like this is a samsung chip
here<00:02:55.550> memory<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.850> these<00:02:57.390> are<00:02:57.540> this

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
here memory and then these are this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.010 
here memory and then these are this
Kingston<00:02:58.440> Kingston<00:02:59.100> Kingston<00:02:59.550> Kingston<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
Kingston Kingston Kingston Kingston so

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.570 
Kingston Kingston Kingston Kingston so
I'm<00:03:01.110> not<00:03:01.260> sure<00:03:01.470> let<00:03:01.620> me<00:03:01.680> see<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.400> see

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I'm not sure let me see if I can see

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:12.500 
I'm not sure let me see if I can see
what<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> says<00:03:08.090> I'm<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.240> exactly<00:03:09.480> sure<00:03:11.510> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
what it says I'm not exactly sure so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.350 
what it says I'm not exactly sure so
again<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.200> both<00:03:14.010> sides<00:03:14.220> micro<00:03:14.610> USB<00:03:14.940> ports<00:03:15.240> it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
again for both sides micro USB ports it

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.640 
again for both sides micro USB ports it
looks<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.840> battery<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.470> you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
looks like this is the battery that you

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.430 
looks like this is the battery that you
can<00:03:16.770> use<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:18.570> basically<00:03:19.230> allows

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can use for that that basically allows

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.850 
can use for that that basically allows
the<00:03:19.950> device<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.910> have<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:22.320> time<00:03:22.560> or

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
the device to have a the time or

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.470 
the device to have a the time or
whatever<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.430> side<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.970> see<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.330> it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
whatever on this side we can see that it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
whatever on this side we can see that it
has<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.650> power<00:03:29.130> ACN<00:03:30.860> 5<00:03:31.860> volt<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.580> 5

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
has the power ACN 5 volt so this is 5

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.500 
has the power ACN 5 volt so this is 5
volt<00:03:33.030> two<00:03:33.300> amp<00:03:33.330> hour<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.120> kids<00:03:36.360> of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
volt two amp hour it is the kids of

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.170 
volt two amp hour it is the kids of
power<00:03:36.750> supply<00:03:37.020> actually<00:03:37.910> comment<00:03:38.910> will<00:03:39.060> show

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
power supply actually comment will show

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.320 
power supply actually comment will show
you<00:03:39.270> this<00:03:39.420> at<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.410> end<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.770> review<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:42.180> one

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
you this at the end of the review so one

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.320 
you this at the end of the review so one
DC<00:03:42.660> jack<00:03:44.630> let's<00:03:45.630> see<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.830> rj45<00:03:47.760> lan<00:03:47.970> port

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
DC jack let's see one rj45 lan port

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.860 
DC jack let's see one rj45 lan port
which<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.690> here

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.759 

this<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.830> think<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.159> the<00:03:57.280> s/pdif<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:59.080> then

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
this I think is the s/pdif and then

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.420 
this I think is the s/pdif and then
there<00:03:59.920> should<00:04:00.129> be<00:04:01.440> sorry<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.980> 3.5

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
there should be sorry this is a 3.5

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.710 
there should be sorry this is a 3.5
millimeter<00:04:03.459> headphone<00:04:03.940> jack<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.330> this<00:04:04.599> is

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
millimeter headphone jack and this is

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.770 
millimeter headphone jack and this is
the<00:04:04.900> DC<00:04:05.549> port<00:04:08.069> so<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.909> actually<00:04:10.120> just<00:04:10.480> try<00:04:10.720> to

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
the DC port so it actually just try to

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.220 
the DC port so it actually just try to
put<00:04:11.110> this<00:04:11.230> back<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.650> case<00:04:12.599> now<00:04:13.599> i<00:04:13.900> want<00:04:14.140> to
