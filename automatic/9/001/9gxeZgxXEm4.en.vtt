00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that's putting the tube hyperloop

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.540 
that's putting the tube hyperloop
inserting<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.750> pod<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:29.170> right<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:30.369> we<00:00:30.430> ready

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.940 

well<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:41.200> what<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.530> building<00:01:41.890> your

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
well it's what you building your

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.310 
well it's what you building your
Hyperloop<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:43.270> first<00:01:43.570> thing<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.869> should<00:01:43.899> do

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
Hyperloop the first thing you should do

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.039 
Hyperloop the first thing you should do
Elon<00:01:45.039> Musk<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.149> should<00:01:46.360> clean<00:01:46.689> out<00:01:46.720> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
Elon Musk is you should clean out the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:56.789 
Elon Musk is you should clean out the
tube<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.649> see<00:01:53.860> come<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.789> here<00:01:55.710> come<00:01:56.710> on

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
tube as we can see come on here come on

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.810 
tube as we can see come on here come on
here<00:01:56.830> audience<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.549> Ted<00:01:58.950> Hughes<00:01:59.950> almonds<00:02:00.369> we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820

most of the way from San Francisco to
Los<00:02:07.119> Angeles<00:02:07.179> here<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:11.489> along<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.640> way<00:02:12.670> it's

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
Los Angeles here but along the way it's
