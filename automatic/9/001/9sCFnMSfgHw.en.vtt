00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello people come to another video of me this will be the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 Introducing Citigo 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.759
 it costs 79 cents in the App Store 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.219
 and her menu melon leaves that Sarah is Mainz 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.540
 and that won in Cologne and was comparable as the whole runs over 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.400
 the center 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.790
 let can contact the developer 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.220
 Entrepreneurs the option because I find only the usual and that one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.390
 few statistics that you can see below 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 after you have two different festivals on Clack Brasilia 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.029
 with this second first the last bars to come so that even 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.650
 did not exist 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.480
 and if you are the first one out and here are 63 different events 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 this standard suit appeared divided into categories 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.130
 and from their usual right-wing few specialists and they can be like that 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.470
 gradually unlock depending on how many golden crown you collected 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.100
 he made them round here a few bitey trees and some 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.639
 By doing so you can unlock with this further al-wazir 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.719
 and to show what it's all about neither from the St as 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.430
 fifth 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.380
 and now in these hits the opponents seemed 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.200
 and destroy the guests, and we have different weapons for that 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.010
 in this sense, they are now only stones so they are normal with their best 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 that now just three tribes the West can now wait too 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170
 and we're just trying to throw it everywhere now we want 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.729
 here in and then percent for that of course in SieÃŸen together ours 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 try that these opponents have broken down already one died and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.590
 There are a few stones left for this, but they are nice too 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.150
 to wait to see who is crushing parents series around "Rex" and thus one 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.050
 Enlargement appears that goes out of the cow because you can aim better 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.340
 those just behind it and then he gets it together and we have that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 already done 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.759
 and depending on how many points you got with young pieces without 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.680
 So now translate the silver that was so nothing special to say so 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.600
 are still holding the golden crown and I finally made it 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.110
 around remnants of the OSO a small crown which is China on which the four points we 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.229
 always get a bit of golden state so 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.219
 how it breaks what I get really for all points so one 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.490
 natural the opponents themselves 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.340
 And besides, even if I somehow it was also under that throws it 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.289
 in the breaks 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.640
 there are always points for it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 And this abomination measuring guests will always be such a little bit 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.759
 more percent consequences 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.920
 and if he has a lot of fun you just get the score we need 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.390
 and to reach that green coal that's usually pretty much and then 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.530
 you have to do it with a few shots, so lead that in the end 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.899
 there is still some left over from these weapons you get ten thousand ex-ob 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.489
 without this is not so good 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.439
 here beautiful surroundings always different so herewith Mathys without 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.260
 snowscape 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.450
 and the opponents are like you Vikings that you could also at which 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 Countries is so which side and if I see here now we have it from 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.829
 Bombs so the artist Gassmann bombs dry tires 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.260
 since we are here in that they are all a bit high 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.440
 klaus-dieter that of course a lot more apart and then still try the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.689
 to advise one 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.499
 and even masters will be done 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.710
 help a person with an exclamation mark over help this year 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.120
 that Sonar's age is our friend and how should we not kill 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.800
 but there are also only negative points Asus can call there brimming 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.280
 only if I have less points 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.740
 and that my game I like well is that and what the tune is new to it 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.920
 comes as a customer a new weapon here 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.760
 For example, later this year I healed and danced with him 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.230
 Of course, stone does not work 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.639
 how very different the materials are 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.739
 Of course, it would be almost impossible for some press to break through some 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.779
 You can also throw words into it, which does not hurt anything 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.340
 The game FCZ offers the variety and the lettering I also more fun 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.520
 So that's why very quickly boring but sets on the complete 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.230
 played out 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 and that was by no means boring simply because the lions had 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.750
 the new addition is the not really cool endgame and these scores 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.260
 Together I will also try to play the second of these 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.460
 and that is also very cool. Ness has the second one to follow from now on 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.510
 Of course, I was very fun and play for a long time 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.270
 SN will have the ignorance Henry Bertel decision difference it just has 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.460
 that from the beginning, as it were, touring on a completely different perspective 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.939
 that is the game completely to the annoying of the 40th 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.919
 and therefore no shallow recommend to anyone for example stuntman 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.290
 sick of it because it has not been so much but that is what it is 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.769
 completely different and for 90 cents per game perfectly fine 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.369
 and that does not make us much of the earthquake
