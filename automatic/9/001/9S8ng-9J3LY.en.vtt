00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.550
 we will fix another video this time 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.380
 a 3 3 of bmw yes, capable of high here 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.699
 even the blind but that does not matter 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.330
 where the problem is it if you do that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.480
 push the button down 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.740
 there is simply no reaction and that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080
 we will fix now 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.199
 We're just taking a dream destination 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.660
 size 10 and screw all 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.630
 unscrew if we screw all 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.680
 We can do that outside 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.690
 motherboard the motherboard it down 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.300
 bolted to the lower part of the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 we simply lift 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 and then you already have it in hand 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 Next thing we also on the we 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.739
 have to pay attention to all the small parts 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.410
 that we do not lose the best 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 just do it where you belong 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.560
 yes where is the problem are quite 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.760
 just chill 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 Of course bmw wants to make money here as well 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.229
 and yes, when customers come more often 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 to change parts 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.960
 So you profit so what we now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.030
 the four contacts have to do 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.900
 to be soldered and that the four around the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 Photocell around on 21 is enough 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.840
 nonsense on it so we have to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.820
 we do not give it any benefit and on the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.010
 other two he's there we have to go with 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 add 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.580
 so does the printer has a 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.710
 photocells as soon as you press on it 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.410
 and there breaks that is yes we do now 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 a bit of a flux on it I am 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.780
 social not only tonic decorating 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.740
 de / video description of the next one 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.970
 I have a very thin tip here 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.860
 had diameter of 0 5 mm yes otherwise 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.300
 otherwise everything else would just be too fat 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.510
 finds everything in my video 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.930
 description and here just look 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.690
 all you need is yes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.550
 when we soldered the page ready 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.850
 so he has one with wiso pro panel 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.090
 and yes, clean it really well because you 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:40.010
 even this one does not have to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.180
 other ladders or something else 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.320
 means is contact with others 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.440
 he is soldered next we take 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.430
 the other side must do too 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 flux on it and here we take 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:06.680
 also solve nonsense fresh because that yes 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.540
 nothing on it and a little something 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.640
 is important in these thin the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.560
 sharpen 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.269
 the need your lÃ¼ck gets hot 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.209
 to adjust 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.870
 I have 400 degrees otherwise there is no 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.110
 nonsense 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.560
 to hang on top because the thinner 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.290
 the top is the warmer it would have to be 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.959
 the next we will adjust 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.660
 These contacts after soldering are 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.920
 a total of eight pieces yes and this much 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.690
 easier than the other contacts before 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.690
 Here we can do this 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.000
 These plastic pieces on the near 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.530
 comment away with the it on it 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.930
 unfortunately we can not remove 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.010
 But there are the contacts a little longer 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:57.160
 that's why it's so much better 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.800
 Next, just the same again 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.680
 be stupid on it and respectively 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.140
 flux and then be stupid on it and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.030
 then clean it then you have it too 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.130
 again all contacts just like that 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.660
 rework if I do it and then 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.740
 you have to work everything again like 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.019
 it should work 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:23.510
 What is important is a soldering iron 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.200
 relatively for or thin 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.220
 and where you also the temperature 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.800
 can adjust 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.360
 you really find it all in mine 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.230
 video description there is also one 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:43.460
 soldering iron which is very cheap believes 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:46.280
 13 euro with with temperature controller the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.710
 arts for tips if only for 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.910
 this repair needs tips and 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 this is not a problem 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.669
 that is perhaps 20 euros going on and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.200
 for that runs and mature at bmw 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.740
 probably 200 euros 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.250
 Who believes the cost of the 200 euro yes 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.000
 now just clean everything yes 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.910
 but photo nic is not conductive during 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.400
 there is no problem left over 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.760
 then this easy again the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.730
 plastic parts back on it 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.940
 do not forget to write that and then 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.820
 simply puts all contacts really 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.520
 everything looks clean then it happens 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.120
 Again, yes yes 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.800
 I do not have to say much about assembling 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.010
 just put it back together 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.000
 that not those plastic parts with her 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.270
 labeled fall out 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.480
 and the four screws on it 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.630
 also screw in and then you have 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.210
 you like my video again 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.910
 I would like to mention the description again 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:01.280
 there really finance the whole 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:04.850
 tool and yes the smg workstation the 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.480
 soldering iron the loeb honey and then you can 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.330
 it really repair that too 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:15.020
 yes here is recording this so far 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.210
 shaky but it should be easy 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.510
 Show that this really is everything 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.930
 Yes, I want to work here 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.060
 also slowly thank you for watching 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.420
 I would be really happy if that was you 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.510
 I liked the video if you think so 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.970
 thumbs up are perhaps thinking 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.030
 about an abo after me would really 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:42.340
 Everything is very happy and yes I wish 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.340
 you much success and servus
