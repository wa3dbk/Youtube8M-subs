00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
least five to 10 minutes before slicing

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.130 
least five to 10 minutes before slicing
it<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.790> way<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> juices<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.510> run<00:02:51.630> off<00:02:51.930> all

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it that way the juices don't run off all

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
it that way the juices don't run off all
over<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> table<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.340> I'm<00:02:53.460> usually<00:02:53.580> not<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.880> big

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
over the table and I'm usually not a big

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.940 
over the table and I'm usually not a big
fan<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.360> slicing<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> duck<00:02:55.110> breast<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
fan of slicing the duck breast but this

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.100 
fan of slicing the duck breast but this
way<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:56.580> see<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.720> finished

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
way you can actually see the finished

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.900 
way you can actually see the finished
mid-rare<00:02:58.470> duck<00:02:58.680> breast<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.100> notice<00:02:59.640> how<00:02:59.760> when

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
mid-rare duck breast and notice how when

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.060 
mid-rare duck breast and notice how when
I<00:02:59.940> sliced<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.840> sliced<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.560> skin<00:03:01.830> side<00:03:02.040> down

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
I sliced it I sliced it skin side down

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.430 
I sliced it I sliced it skin side down
so<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:03.030> way<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.240> wasn't<00:03:03.570> crushing<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> meat

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
so that way I wasn't crushing the meat

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.910 
so that way I wasn't crushing the meat
trying<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> get<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.100> crispy<00:03:05.640> skin
