00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
u-turns and the reverse move remember in

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.230 
u-turns and the reverse move remember in
the<00:00:26.829> beginning<00:00:26.919> in<00:00:27.310> phase<00:00:27.550> one<00:00:27.820> you're<00:00:28.060> using

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.089 
the beginning in phase one you're using
full<00:00:28.630> food<00:00:28.869> lure<00:00:29.110> which<00:00:29.410> means<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.769> have<00:00:29.949> the

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
full food lure which means you have the

full food lure which means you have the
food<00:00:30.250> in<00:00:30.519> your<00:00:30.550> hand<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:31.060> you're<00:00:31.840> using<00:00:31.990> the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
food in your hand and you're using the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.290 
food in your hand and you're using the
food<00:00:32.349> like<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.680> magnet<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.430> get<00:00:33.550> your<00:00:33.730> job

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

so<00:00:46.360> this<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.750> actually<00:00:47.050> Phase<00:00:47.950> three<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.600> in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so this is actually Phase three and in

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020 
so this is actually Phase three and in
Phase<00:00:51.760> three<00:00:51.790> you're<00:00:52.600> not<00:00:53.250> using<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.490> food<00:00:54.790> lure

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
Phase three you're not using a food lure

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.220 
Phase three you're not using a food lure
and<00:00:55.740> you<00:00:56.740> are<00:00:56.890> not<00:00:57.130> prompting<00:00:58.060> so<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.020> see

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
and you are not prompting so you see

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.840 
and you are not prompting so you see
Vita<00:00:59.530> looking<00:00:59.800> up<00:00:59.950> at<00:01:00.070> me<00:01:00.160> there<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.670> can

towards me Vita is coming towards me and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.310 
towards me Vita is coming towards me and
when<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.000> stop<00:01:19.900> moving<00:01:20.790> she<00:01:21.790> has<00:01:22.090> learned<00:01:22.450> to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
when I stop moving she has learned to

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.820 
when I stop moving she has learned to
sit<00:01:23.860> or<00:01:24.250> she's<00:01:25.240> she<00:01:25.990> knows<00:01:26.170> when<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.440> reach<00:01:26.680> into

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
sit or she's she knows when I reach into

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.030 
sit or she's she knows when I reach into
my<00:01:26.920> bag<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:28.470> sitting<00:01:29.470> is<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.619> good<00:01:29.770> thing<00:01:29.920> to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
my bag that sitting is a good thing to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.580 
my bag that sitting is a good thing to
do<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.430> then<00:01:31.390> once<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:32.050> behavior<00:01:32.470> is

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
do and then once the behavior is

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.150 
do and then once the behavior is
complete<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.780> give<00:01:35.470> her<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.800> food<00:01:35.950> reward

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
complete then I give her the food reward

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.840 
complete then I give her the food reward
so<00:01:36.729> this<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.060> phase<00:01:37.360> three

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.690 

I<00:01:41.939> had<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> grab<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> clip<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.950> different

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I had to grab a clip from a different

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.660 
I had to grab a clip from a different
video<00:01:45.570> project<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.830> some<00:01:47.009> reason<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> didn't

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
video project for some reason I didn't

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.140 
video project for some reason I didn't
have<00:01:47.790> phase<00:01:48.150> one<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.990> Vita<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.830> we<00:01:49.950> have

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
have phase one with Vita so here we have

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.649 
have phase one with Vita so here we have
phase<00:01:51.150> one<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.310> using<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> full<00:01:54.360> food

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
phase one of this way using a full food

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.180 
phase one of this way using a full food
lure<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.560> reaching<00:01:55.830> down<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
lure you see me reaching down and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.109 
lure you see me reaching down and
feeding<00:01:57.060> Lily<00:01:57.890> very<00:01:58.890> close<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.520> left<00:01:59.790> leg

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
feeding Lily very close to my left leg

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.710 
feeding Lily very close to my left leg
after<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.229> performed<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> u-turn<00:02:02.720> so

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
after we have performed the u-turn so

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.950 
after we have performed the u-turn so
again<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.320> phase<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.960> u-turn

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
again this is phase one of u-turn

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.290 
again this is phase one of u-turn
training<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.310> call<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.970> way<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:12.239> way

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
training which we call this way this way

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.790 
training which we call this way this way
Tina<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.600> way<00:02:18.170> what<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.590> clip

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
Tina this way what we see in this clip

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.440 
Tina this way what we see in this clip
is<00:02:19.950> kind<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> between<00:02:20.370> Phase<00:02:21.120> two<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is kind of in between Phase two and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.990 
is kind of in between Phase two and
