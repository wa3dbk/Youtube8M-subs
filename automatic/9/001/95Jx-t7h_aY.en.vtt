hatching the baby and the business plan

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
hatching the baby and the business plan
with<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.720> hatching<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.439> unlimited<00:00:22.650> disk

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
with the hatching you get unlimited disk

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.670 
with the hatching you get unlimited disk
space<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.730> unlimited<00:00:24.300> bandwidth<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.380> only

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
space and unlimited bandwidth the only

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.529 
space and unlimited bandwidth the only
downside<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:26.880> host<00:00:27.210> one

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
downside is that you can only host one

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
downside is that you can only host one
domain<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> hatching<00:00:28.590> plan<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
domain with the hatching plan so if you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.310
