00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello friends youtube friends 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 I was that a how-to tutorial 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.320
 get all the armor all the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.629
 helmets all halo positions 4 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 even those that are downloaded with the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.090
 special and good addition the first thing that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.930
 we have to do is create a profile 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.939
 offline 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.670
 They can also be online but no longer 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.220
 a lot because I really tell them 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.560
 honestly I have no idea if the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 bathe or not, so I recommend it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 more than doing it offline but if 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.480
 you want to do it like like 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.620
 there and you say 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 and good since we created the profile what 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.810
 let's do or do save save it 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.410
 in an usb of at least 2 gigabytes 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.840
 I have one of eight but good of two 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.190
 It is good and good since they saved it 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.070
 there they are going to start the halo four they are going to 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.809
 chop start and the place will appear 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.630
 of storage you are going to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.010
 put in the memory unit and with that 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.760
 you are already this sandy interface 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.790
 they disconnect the usb from the xbox and what 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.280
 they connect to the pool and good to do 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.780
 this trick what we're going to need 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.330
 are going to be two programs that is called 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 horizon and ellipse that I will leave 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.200
 obviously in the description of the video and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.079
 well let's start 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.259
 good since we connect our usb with 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.620
 the profile to our pc 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.690
 we are going to open orito 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.220
 after we open home paris 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.220
 in the sky 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.450
 ah 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.610
 and good now if we are going to horizon and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.930
 as you can see here already crawling this 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 so then what we are going to do is going to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.750
 be put in the night 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.590
 rise and we will look for our profile that 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.590
 nor 14 this 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.970
 and since we are and we keep shore not 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:46.550
 we close it open the book and let it be 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 the right one wants that we put in 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.890
 profile 2 and we lower it and we put halo 4 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 that's good then we're going to look like this 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.640
 we put you in open 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.640
 we go desk and we look 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.709
 since we open it 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.959
 if you do this without playing this 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.060
 halo 4 is going to look like they do not exist 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.459
 nothing about the 4 that can move this 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.549
 they will then serving as shortest 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.890
 good since we put the profile what 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.310
 let's do it's going to be here the most 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.770
 For this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.620
 good if you want to be level 50 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.830
 then here is therefore tics like 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.540
 here I said sport armor we are going to put 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.290
 if you want to have all the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.019
 shells to avoid corporate and what 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.920
 they put on all the helmets they can not see 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.920
 Photos 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.430
 good good in my case I 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.340
 and in viewer and in Yiddish parts that are the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.460
 I consider 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.200
 postures we put it here and it's going to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.360
 bring all then good since 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.810
 we select all this that we put 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.220
 maximum palomita this is what 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.500
 you want and they put you in 6 already 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.290
 I put this little message on the bridge 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.600
 that we close this we close this and 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.320
 we go back to Orissa now what are we going 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:01.010
 do is going to be pulling this file that 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:09.130
 we keep with him with the lip here and it's ok 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:14.510
