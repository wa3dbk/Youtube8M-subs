00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
lightweight division and so it can

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.080 
lightweight division and so it can

see a fight in which I thought Juan

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
see a fight in which I thought Juan
Manuel<00:01:19.830> Marquez<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.759> beaten<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.479> thought<00:01:22.140> he'd

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
Manuel Marquez was beaten I thought he'd

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.149

relentlessly<00:01:28.829> docked<00:01:29.340> Juan<00:01:29.670> Manuel<00:01:29.909> Marquez

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
relentlessly docked Juan Manuel Marquez

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.910 
relentlessly docked Juan Manuel Marquez
and<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:32.009> guess<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:32.939> I'm<00:01:33.090> saying<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.710> here's<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and I guess what I'm saying is here's to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
and I guess what I'm saying is here's to
the<00:01:35.040> idea<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.579> history<00:01:36.320> records<00:01:37.320> Juan

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the idea that history records Juan

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940 
the idea that history records Juan
