00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the way you'll have to allocate around

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400 
the way you'll have to allocate around
1000<00:01:25.840> megabytes<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.700> by<00:01:28.240> default<00:01:28.450> does

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
1000 megabytes because by default does

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.880 
1000 megabytes because by default does
box<00:01:29.740> allocates<00:01:30.370> like<00:01:30.780> 100<00:01:31.780> or<00:01:31.900> 200<00:01:32.440> megabytes

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
box allocates like 100 or 200 megabytes

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.660 
box allocates like 100 or 200 megabytes
and<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.430> game<00:01:33.610> requires<00:01:34.030> more<00:01:35.400> ok<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:36.460> you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
and the game requires more ok so you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.000 
and the game requires more ok so you
need<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.180> write<00:01:37.770> um<00:01:38.940> 3<00:01:40.350> size<00:01:42.900> 1000<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.680> means

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
need to write um 3 size 1000 it means

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.150 
need to write um 3 size 1000 it means
that<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.520> will<00:01:45.730> give<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.470> 1000<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.560> free<00:01:47.800> space

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
that it will give you 1000 of free space

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.500 
that it will give you 1000 of free space
in<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.710> let's<00:01:50.710> say<00:01:50.980> virtual<00:01:51.820> drive<00:01:52.060> X

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
in in this let's say virtual drive X

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.370 
in in this let's say virtual drive X
okay<00:01:54.260> so<00:01:54.320> as<00:01:54.980> you<00:01:55.040> can<00:01:55.190> see<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.570> drive<00:01:56.810> X<00:01:57.170> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
okay so as you can see the drive X is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.320 
okay so as you can see the drive X is
mountains<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.610> we'll<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.150> go

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
mountains right now so we'll have to go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.460 
mountains right now so we'll have to go
to<00:01:59.390> this<00:01:59.690> drive<00:02:00.080> by<00:02:00.650> writing<00:02:00.860> X<00:02:02.020> okay<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.080> now

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
to this drive by writing X okay so now

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.830 
to this drive by writing X okay so now
we<00:02:03.530> are<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.160> this<00:02:04.370> drive<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.090> we'll<00:02:05.420> have<00:02:05.630> to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
we are in this drive and we'll have to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.540 
we are in this drive and we'll have to
go<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.470> DF<00:02:07.430> CD<00:02:08.090> folder
