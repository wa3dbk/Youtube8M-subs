00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
complete for my selfish self expression

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.240 
complete for my selfish self expression
I<00:02:23.700> guess<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.930> saying<00:02:24.959> with<00:02:25.380> Kelly<00:02:25.650> I'm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I guess as I was saying with Kelly I'm

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.040 
I guess as I was saying with Kelly I'm
still<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.970> working<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.630> people<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
still kind of working with people and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.490 
still kind of working with people and
you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:30.000> bouncing<00:02:30.510> ideas<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:31.020> people

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you know I'm bouncing ideas of people

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
you know I'm bouncing ideas of people
but<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.070> do<00:02:32.190> too<00:02:32.520> i'm<00:02:32.640> literally<00:02:32.910> just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
but when I do too i'm literally just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
but when I do too i'm literally just
playing<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.959> want<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.230> hear

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
playing what it is that I want to hear

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.210 
playing what it is that I want to hear
so<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:35.430> probably<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.850> selfish<00:02:36.390> yes<00:02:37.220> it's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
so that's probably more selfish yes it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.300 
so that's probably more selfish yes it's
doing<00:02:38.580> electric<00:02:39.120> music<00:02:39.300> like

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
doing electric music like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.260 
doing electric music like
cross-pollinating<00:02:41.310> your<00:02:41.550> work<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.090> getting

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
cross-pollinating your work and getting

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.790 
cross-pollinating your work and getting

play this song

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.460

and<00:04:22.580> they<00:04:22.850> played<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.540> people<00:04:23.900> have

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
and they played it and people have

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.440 
and they played it and people have
copied<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:25.010> but<00:04:25.040> she<00:04:25.550> was<00:04:25.670> told<00:04:25.910> by<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.150> record

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
copied it but she was told by a record

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.910 
copied it but she was told by a record
company<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.930> she<00:04:27.200> could<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.410> they<00:04:27.620> wouldn't

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
company that she could be they wouldn't

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.320 
company that she could be they wouldn't
it<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.400> record<00:04:28.640> wasn't<00:04:28.850> good<00:04:29.000> enough<00:04:29.030> in

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
it the record wasn't good enough in

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.450 
it the record wasn't good enough in
cheek<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.720> think<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.050> was<00:04:30.400> apparently<00:04:31.400> a

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
cheek and I think that was apparently a

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.520 
cheek and I think that was apparently a
big<00:04:31.640> part<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.030> reason<00:04:32.060> why<00:04:32.300> she<00:04:32.630> spun<00:04:33.410> off

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
big part of the reason why she spun off

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.800 
big part of the reason why she spun off
the<00:04:33.560> rails<00:04:33.890> which<00:04:34.370> which<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:35.090> would<00:04:35.270> understand

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the rails which which I would understand

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.570 
the rails which which I would understand
because<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.500> must<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.740> very<00:04:36.770> frustrating<00:04:36.980> to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
because it must be very frustrating to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.240 
because it must be very frustrating to
just<00:04:37.880> be<00:04:38.000> like<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.180> puppet<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:39.500> not<00:04:39.680> be<00:04:39.830> able<00:04:39.950> to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
just be like a puppet and not be able to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.310 
just be like a puppet and not be able to
be<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:40.910> control<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.390> what<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.170> you're

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
be in control of what it is that you're

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.950 
be in control of what it is that you're
the<00:04:42.920> image<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.490> know<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.150> art<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.810> you're
