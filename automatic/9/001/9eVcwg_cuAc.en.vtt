00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello dear friends lovers 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.570
 fishing today I'll take off so short 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.400
 video that concerns names 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.059
 courting coils there and not a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 pushed on this video video Basil 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.279
 Gorodetsky as such are often 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.880
 unpleasant moments when they 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.680
 caution man coming fishing 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 the shorter i collect my coil starts 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 casts or there the cord flew away from him or 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 starts to spin up will not understand what a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.190
 then the reason is such a banal rim 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 spools hit if anyone is interested here 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.219
 Vasily Rayevsky shot a video like 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 troubleshoot such trouble with 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 using nail files from female 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.399
 nadfile he cleaned well this is a good method and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 A good option to eliminate is when 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.170
 there was such a thing but there is a simpler one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 How can I prevent this? 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 there were such troubles though of course 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.250
 if you have been spinning such I have 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.510
 that 's the same in fishing practice in moments 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 when the fisherman stand apart the trumpeter 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.240
 then leaving the water put pink for example 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 on a branch bucket or was u touched it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 Tomiris arranged or wind for example 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.130
 Sveta has dropped out and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.289
 on a stone for example 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 this tag can be damaged then 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.329
 such a way what force raevsky 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.170
 relevant but in general to avoid here 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.430
 it happens 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.969
 Many novice anglers even have me 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.460
 do not have a rub covers hard then 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.619
 what is the sale tuba for the coils here 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.000
 me too a coil in a soft so simple 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.310
 those years I am, and I can assure you there 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.979
 take with you a smear or knife there 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.709
 near lies or something like that and in a backpack 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.170
 Well, there is a soft 3 for a ket somewhere there 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.860
 did someone hit hit and bostic 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.569
 damaged by 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.049
 and on many reel especially expensive there 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.110
 not very expensive side close spat 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.840
 on the spool it is the coil coated with nitride 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 titanium if we take it already finite up 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.180
 the lair of the volume is not and then already broken 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 integrity guests to behold i will show you 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.540
 very simple 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 I repeat the video will be short again 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.549
 as telling but they will 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.400
 easy way 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.230
 but it is very useful who liked may 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.930
 take advantage in my practice 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 fishing was not less than 10 reels and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.660
 not on one coil and I assure you not 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.250
 hurt there's a video about shcherbakov 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.370
 Shcherbakov brothers where they tell 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.859
 maintenance and protection coils 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.139
 from any damage and they recommend 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.019
 on the spool coils I also did this before 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.780
 see no video thanks to them of course I am 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.720
 wore 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 caps from cans e deodorants and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.120
 there are all kinds of perfumes there 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.920
 and then for example lubricants and there are 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.310
 caps that can be of plastic and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.790
 Cafe 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.790
 caps on top you can pick up under 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.709
 any shpulyu and I applied you to everything 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 Equally it's not that, but this method 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.170
 which I now show it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.780
 insulation plumbing pipe is on but 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 from the plan is much better than all these 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.890
 Soft caps are easy to remove. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.920
 dresses easy 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.560
 practical and I can assure you as a repeat 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.040
 I had about a dozen stew never 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.609
 no problems but as the cartoon itself 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.260
 never seen nothing 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.599
 diameter for this mouth dist coil 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.040
 different diameters 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.019
 plumbing plundered but you can caress 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.079
 buy any meter there you bought 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.940
 enough for put here the department is straight 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.099
 along with is the only recommend 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.390
 after fishing when you came home 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.519
 still remove this to dry the cord 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:03.190
 dry a little because the air 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:06.430
 bad come and here are these two spare 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.079
 the spool is also tight-fitting and I just 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.810
 confident in her way 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.150
 that i won't have 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.270
 problems came fishing got there 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.820
 spool deformation then asshole some all 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.220
 Rybachy can not be outside because lace 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.880
 standing can be killed in just two or three 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.810
 casting 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.590
 so I recommend everyone to use 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.200
 in such a simple way water together two 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.380
 bullets out for a minute not just so 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.720
 I recommend for beginners 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.490
 use experienced fishermen 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.800
 enjoy the beam create the trophy 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.880
 fish who liked the video put 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.979
 thumbs up subscribe to my channel 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.820
 good luck everyone no tail no scales to new 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.820
 good luck meetings
