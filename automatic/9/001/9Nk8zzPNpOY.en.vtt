00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.640
 material I advise several options and 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:24.720
 use natural material for this 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 use the branches of the vine is pretty 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.539
 durable material but harvested 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.329
 its better in spring then 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:39.140
 branches have more flexibility and you have 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.110

 Looks great you can 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.430
 use hazel branches and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.740
 decorated with such branches to a light bulb 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 weaving will also look 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.299
 great, but here is presented 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 snag is a very natural material 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.000
 you can also use natural 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.659
 a rock 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 he looks very nice and as you can see 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.860
 on photo 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 he doesn't have to be perfect 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.729
 forms it can be laid one on another 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.180
 it may be pebbles large cans 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:45.170
 and it can also be cemented and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.680
 it is very long term 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 flower arrangement 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.370
 recent fashion grid option 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 stone fill 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:02.970
 and you can also pour the desired solution 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.010
 you configuration and then veneer 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.200
 can be tiled or natural stone 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.550
 or special facing stone 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.690
 It is also advised to use and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 artificial materials first 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.110
 use the bottles that you have 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 probably accumulated enough but need them 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.710
 fill with sand and then they will 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.590
 serve long plates for a wonderful 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.870
 option if they bored you forward on

 you will want but it will serve years 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.370
 five so before using 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.640
 think whether you will need it later 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.950
