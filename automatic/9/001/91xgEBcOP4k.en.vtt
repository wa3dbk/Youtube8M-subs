due<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.240> something<00:00:29.449> we<00:00:29.689> call<00:00:29.929> composition<00:00:31.840> so

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
due to something we call composition so

due to something we call composition so
what<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.290> composition<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.160> why<00:00:34.489> have<00:00:34.760> it

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
what is composition and why have it

simply put composition is how and where
we<00:00:38.600> place<00:00:38.960> elements<00:00:39.470> in<00:00:39.559> our<00:00:39.650> photos<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.430> tell

take photographs with better composition

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.109 
take photographs with better composition
once<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.010> have<00:00:55.100> mastered<00:00:55.250> composition

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
once you have mastered composition

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.119 
once you have mastered composition
you'll<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.900> able<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.290> direct<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.860> viewers

look at some of the compositional tools
you<00:01:16.939> can<00:01:17.060> use<00:01:17.649> framing<00:01:18.729> format<00:01:19.869> viewpoint

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070

lines<00:01:27.280> let's<00:01:28.280> start<00:01:28.549> by<00:01:28.700> organizing<00:01:28.939> a

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
lines let's start by organizing a

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.310 
lines let's start by organizing a
chaotic<00:01:29.960> composition<00:01:30.649> using<00:01:31.009> framing

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
chaotic composition using framing

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.899 
chaotic composition using framing
framing<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.649> all<00:01:33.890> about<00:01:34.159> asking<00:01:34.579> yourself

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
framing is all about asking yourself

what's in the frame or where elements
are<00:01:51.889> located<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.520> frame<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.600> result

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
are located in the frame and the result

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.230 
are located in the frame and the result

foreground element and a crooked horizon
now<00:02:02.689> look<00:02:02.899> at<00:02:03.020> our<00:02:03.109> second<00:02:03.499> shot<00:02:03.710> we<00:02:04.340> simply

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
now look at our second shot we simply

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.849 
now look at our second shot we simply
moved<00:02:05.030> our<00:02:05.209> own<00:02:05.389> position<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.049> directed<00:02:06.740> our

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
moved our own position and directed our

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.620 
moved our own position and directed our
subject<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.429> move<00:02:07.639> a<00:02:07.729> little<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.240> opposite

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
subject to move a little in the opposite

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.650 
subject to move a little in the opposite
direction<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.950> result<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:11.209> pole<00:02:11.450> is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
direction and the result the pole is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.510 
direction and the result the pole is
moved<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.380> no<00:02:12.560> longer<00:02:12.770> sticking<00:02:13.190> out<00:02:13.400> of

these are another great compositional
tool<00:04:09.640> if<00:04:10.030> we<00:04:10.840> want<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.140> reinforce<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
tool if we want to reinforce the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.039 
tool if we want to reinforce the
relationship<00:04:12.549> between<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.000> elements<00:04:13.420> try

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
relationship between the elements try

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.680 
relationship between the elements try
placing<00:04:14.469> them<00:04:14.590> within<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.920> triangle<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:16.359> shape

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
placing them within a triangle the shape

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.840 
placing them within a triangle the shape
and<00:04:16.900> direction<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.799> these<00:04:17.979> triangles<00:04:18.519> can

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
and direction of these triangles can

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.370 
and direction of these triangles can
vary<00:04:19.180> depending<00:04:19.449> on<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.989> scene<00:04:20.199> you're

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
vary depending on the scene you're

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.850 
vary depending on the scene you're
photographing<00:04:21.419> lines<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.590> careful

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
photographing lines with the careful

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.279 
photographing lines with the careful
placement<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.580> lines<00:04:24.820> within<00:04:25.300> our<00:04:25.449> image<00:04:25.780> we

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
placement of lines within our image we

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.140 
placement of lines within our image we
can<00:04:26.440> draw<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.770> viewer<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.520> lead<00:04:27.940> them

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
can draw the viewer in and lead them

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.050 
can draw the viewer in and lead them
through<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.570> image<00:04:29.280> lines<00:04:30.280> are<00:04:30.460> also<00:04:30.639> great

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
through the image lines are also great

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.999 
through the image lines are also great
at<00:04:31.270> creating<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.810> sense<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.199> depth<00:04:32.500> within<00:04:32.800> an

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
at creating a sense of depth within an

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.610 
at creating a sense of depth within an
image<00:04:33.509> there<00:04:34.509> are<00:04:34.539> different<00:04:35.020> types<00:04:35.259> of<00:04:35.440> line

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
image there are different types of line

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.460 
image there are different types of line
we<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:35.949> use<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.750> leading<00:04:37.750> lines<00:04:38.110> and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
we can use to do this leading lines and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.120 
we can use to do this leading lines and
converging<00:04:39.430> lines<00:04:40.080> sometimes<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.710> line<00:04:41.919> can

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
converging lines sometimes the line can

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.860 
converging lines sometimes the line can
be<00:04:42.220> implied<00:04:42.550> through<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.090> use<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.270> elements

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
be implied through the use of elements

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.300 
be implied through the use of elements
that<00:04:43.930> appear<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.349> connect<00:04:44.800> through<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.099> image

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
that appear to connect through the image

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.990 
that appear to connect through the image
and<00:04:45.840> finally<00:04:46.840> natural<00:04:47.620> framing<00:04:48.009> you<00:04:48.729> can<00:04:48.880> use

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
and finally natural framing you can use

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.670 
and finally natural framing you can use
many<00:04:49.270> things<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.750> frame<00:04:49.990> your<00:04:50.110> subject<00:04:50.530> and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
many things to frame your subject and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.279 
many things to frame your subject and
this<00:04:51.550> image<00:04:51.849> we<00:04:52.330> direct<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.870> viewer<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.169> the

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
this image we direct the viewer to the

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.379 
this image we direct the viewer to the
main<00:04:53.560> element<00:04:53.979> by<00:04:54.340> framing<00:04:54.849> the<00:04:54.940> image<00:04:55.210> with
