00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
if you saw the last video there's still

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.910 
if you saw the last video there's still
Kennecott<00:00:03.600> Copper<00:00:03.840> Mine<00:00:04.350> home<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.830> the

Kennecott Copper Mine home of the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.700 
Kennecott Copper Mine home of the
largest<00:00:05.339> open<00:00:06.330> pit<00:00:06.569> mine<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.410> largest

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
largest open pit mine and the largest

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.690 
largest open pit mine and the largest
landslide<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:09.110> world<00:00:10.110> known<00:00:10.800> world<00:00:11.070> history<00:00:11.460> I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
landslide in world known world history I

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.959 
landslide in world known world history I
think<00:00:12.500> maybe<00:00:13.500> Mount<00:00:13.799> st.<00:00:14.070> Helens<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.580> bigger<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
think maybe Mount st. Helens is bigger I

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.129 
think maybe Mount st. Helens is bigger I
don't<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.240> somebody<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.080> up

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
don't know somebody can look that up

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
don't know somebody can look that up
anyway<00:00:16.770> they're<00:00:16.949> still<00:00:17.250> digging<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.699> their

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
anyway they're still digging out their

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.050 
anyway they're still digging out their
big<00:00:18.990> bulldozers<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:20.490> there<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.810> anyway<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
big bulldozers up there so anyway it is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
big bulldozers up there so anyway it is
spring<00:00:24.060> look<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.570> him<00:00:24.750> isn't<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.080> gorgeous

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
spring look at him isn't that gorgeous

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
spring look at him isn't that gorgeous
look<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.340> those<00:00:26.490> trees<00:00:29.150> daffodils<00:00:30.150> are

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
look at those trees daffodils are

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590 
look at those trees daffodils are
blooming<00:00:30.480> hyacinth<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.679> hyacinth<00:00:32.219> in'<00:00:32.600> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
blooming hyacinth is hyacinth in' and

blooming hyacinth is hyacinth in' and
last<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.739> left<00:00:36.079> our<00:00:37.079> sprinklers<00:00:38.420> remember<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
last we left our sprinklers remember I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.049 
last we left our sprinklers remember I
said<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.340> leave<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.610> open<00:00:42.170> its<00:00:43.170> open<00:00:44.059> open

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
said to leave these open its open open

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
said to leave these open its open open
open<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:45.930> open<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:47.010> open<00:00:47.329> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
open all the way open these are open you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.930 
open all the way open these are open you
can<00:00:48.480> tell<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:48.870> they're<00:00:49.289> parallel<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
can tell because they're parallel with

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
can tell because they're parallel with
the<00:00:51.120> pipe<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.690> handles<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> these

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the pipe these handles here and these

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
the pipe these handles here and these
screws<00:00:54.890> flathead<00:00:55.890> screws<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.930> parallel<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
screws flathead screws are parallel with

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.720 
screws flathead screws are parallel with
the<00:00:58.469> pipe<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> means<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.520> all

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the pipe so that means these are all

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.060 
the pipe so that means these are all
open<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> remember<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> lets<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
open and if you remember that lets the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.969 
open and if you remember that lets the
air<00:01:02.570> go<00:01:03.570> down<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.799> if

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
air go down so the water can get out if

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
air go down so the water can get out if
it<00:01:05.129> starts<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> build<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.299> first<00:01:07.110> thing

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it starts to build up so first thing

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.149 
it starts to build up so first thing
we're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.689> close<00:01:09.689> these<00:01:10.159> there

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we're going to do is close these there

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:11.830 
we're going to do is close these there
we<00:01:11.250> go

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
we go

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.880 
we go
see<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.830> parallel<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.460> they're

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
see now it's not parallel but they're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.340 
see now it's not parallel but they're
perpendicular<00:01:17.060> closed<00:01:18.060> closed<00:01:20.659> closed<00:01:21.770> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
perpendicular closed closed closed and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.749 
perpendicular closed closed closed and
closed<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.150> these<00:01:27.799> stay<00:01:28.799> open<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.520> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
closed and these stay open because we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.069 
closed and these stay open because we're
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> let<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> water<00:01:30.509> flow<00:01:30.600> through<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
going to let the water flow through so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.210 
going to let the water flow through so
we'll<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> basement<00:01:31.770> I'll<00:01:32.040> show<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
we'll go down the basement I'll show you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
we'll go down the basement I'll show you
what<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> down<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.140> okay<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.500> are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
what to do down there okay here we are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
what to do down there okay here we are
back<00:01:34.829> underneath<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> porch<00:01:36.090> next<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
back underneath the porch next to the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
back underneath the porch next to the
manifold<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> saw<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> refresher

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
manifold you saw now again a refresher

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840 
manifold you saw now again a refresher
this<00:01:40.079> bottom<00:01:40.590> part<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> pipe<00:01:41.460> work<00:01:41.640> comes

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this bottom part of the pipe work comes

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
this bottom part of the pipe work comes
out<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> wall<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> comes<00:01:43.259> from

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
out of the wall is where it comes from

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.100 
out of the wall is where it comes from
the<00:01:43.619> city<00:01:43.890> splits<00:01:44.820> off<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.750> house

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the city splits off that's the house

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.950 
the city splits off that's the house
line<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> tell<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
line you can tell because it has this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.060 
line you can tell because it has this
regulator<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> house<00:01:49.770> water

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
regulator here for the house water

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.429 
regulator here for the house water
pressure<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> comes<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
pressure and then it comes up and this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
pressure and then it comes up and this
one's<00:01:52.680> perpendicular<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.610> where<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.119> shut

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
one's perpendicular that's where we shut

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.520 
one's perpendicular that's where we shut
off<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.619> sprinkler<00:01:56.490> line<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:58.380> up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
off the sprinkler line so and right up

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.889 
off the sprinkler line so and right up
here<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.369> things<00:01:59.729> leak<00:02:00.119> remember<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
here see these things leak remember and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.830 
here see these things leak remember and
maybe<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> drip<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> day<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.479> pile<00:02:03.810> up

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
maybe a drip a day but that will pile up

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
maybe a drip a day but that will pile up
and<00:02:04.409> fill<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:04.890> pipe<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.939> they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and fill up your pipe again so they

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.669 
and fill up your pipe again so they
installed<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.409> drain<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:10.140> leave<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> open

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
installed this drain and I leave it open

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.800 
installed this drain and I leave it open
this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.730> open

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
this is open

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.809 
this is open
it's<00:02:12.959> again<00:02:13.590> perpendicular<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.580> pipe

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
it's again perpendicular with this pipe

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.910 
it's again perpendicular with this pipe
and<00:02:15.090> look<00:02:15.750> how<00:02:15.930> much<00:02:16.110> water<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.500> got<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and look how much water we got out of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.240

here
I<00:02:17.280> already<00:02:17.670> emptied<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.270> once<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
I already emptied this once so this is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.570 
I already emptied this once so this is
one<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.640> these<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.140> Costco<00:02:22.800> nut<00:02:23.040> containers

people even though they think they

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.260 
people even though they think they
winterized<00:02:32.190> their<00:02:32.400> pipes<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.150> them
