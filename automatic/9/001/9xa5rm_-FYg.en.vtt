cutters project will basically be
threading<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.760> microphones<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
threading on these microphones in that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
threading on these microphones in that
order<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.799> you've<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.430> eight<00:01:11.549> mil<00:01:11.820> by

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
order so you've got the eight mil by

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630 
order so you've got the eight mil by
cone<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.840> square<00:01:13.290> del<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> clear<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
cone the square del in the clear and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
cone the square del in the clear and
then<00:01:15.270> you've<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.869> six<00:01:16.170> smell<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.710> phone

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
then you've got the six smell by phone

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
then you've got the six smell by phone
on<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.850> sera<00:01:18.210> ski<00:01:18.420> crystal<00:01:18.840> head<00:01:19.020> pins

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
on to the sera ski crystal head pins

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.920 
on to the sera ski crystal head pins
along<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> Daisy<00:01:20.250> spaces<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.780> I'll<00:01:21.900> just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
along with the Daisy spaces so I'll just

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:57.110 
along with the Daisy spaces so I'll just
thread<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.560> both<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> same<00:01:23.820> time

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.600 

okay<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.050> what<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.500> need<00:01:58.620> to<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.310> we

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
okay so what we need to do now is we

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.960 
okay so what we need to do now is we
need<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.910> cut<00:02:00.120> them<00:02:00.330> at<00:02:00.870> about<00:02:01.580> about<00:02:02.580> point

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
need to cut them at about about point

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.210 
need to cut them at about about point
nine<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> cinema<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.260> nine<00:02:04.500> millimeters

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
nine of the cinema so nine millimeters

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.810 
nine of the cinema so nine millimeters
above<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.690> end<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> crystals<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.550> then

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
above the end of the crystals and then

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.460 
above the end of the crystals and then
we're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.150> to<00:02:09.240> bend<00:02:09.810> them<00:02:09.990> at<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> right

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
we're going to bend them at a right

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.200 
we're going to bend them at a right
angle<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:10.920> turn<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.610> around<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
angle and turn them around with the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.910 
angle and turn them around with the
round<00:02:12.360> nose<00:02:12.600> pliers<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.230> make<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.740> loop

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
round nose pliers to make the loop

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.140 
round nose pliers to make the loop
that's<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> ear<00:02:15.390> stud<00:02:15.780> I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's going to go on to the ear stud I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.330 
that's going to go on to the ear stud I
tend<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> do<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.900> section<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
tend to do is this section with the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
tend to do is this section with the
earrings<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:22.140> by<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.600> see

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
earrings one by one and so I can see

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.640 
earrings one by one and so I can see
that<00:02:24.990> they're<00:02:25.140> both<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> same<00:02:25.980> level<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that they're both at the same level and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.710 
that they're both at the same level and
this<00:02:28.650> ensures<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> when<00:02:29.700> you're<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
this ensures that when you're going to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.890 
this ensures that when you're going to
have<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> ear<00:02:31.500> wires<00:02:31.860> together<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:33.690> they

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
have the ear wires together that they

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.100 
have the ear wires together that they
are<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.320> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.250> links<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
are there going to be the same links and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
are there going to be the same links and
one<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.350> any<00:02:37.620> longer<00:02:37.770> than<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> other<00:02:40.370> up<00:02:41.370> in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
one not any longer than the other up in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.480 
one not any longer than the other up in
there<00:02:41.850> around

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:03:02.690 

Oh

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.180 

okay<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:03.970> they<00:03:04.090> voice<00:03:04.300> bent<00:03:04.690> around<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.379> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
okay so they voice bent around there and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.250 
okay so they voice bent around there and
