hundred miles on the freeway on i-5

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.230 
hundred miles on the freeway on i-5
which<00:02:23.780> means<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.290> got<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.470> maintain<00:02:25.030> 70<00:02:26.030> miles

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
which means we got to maintain 70 miles

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.070 
which means we got to maintain 70 miles
an<00:02:26.450> hour<00:02:26.570> at

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
an hour at

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.910 
an hour at
least<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.610> we're<00:02:29.270> thinking<00:02:29.650> pretty<00:02:30.650> mild

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
least and so we're thinking pretty mild

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
least and so we're thinking pretty mild
like<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> two<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.730> half<00:02:31.910> inch<00:02:32.150> suspension

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
like a two and a half inch suspension

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.560 
like a two and a half inch suspension
lift<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.650> already<00:02:33.920> has<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.180> trailer<00:02:35.180> hitch<00:02:35.360> on

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
lift it already has a trailer hitch on

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.390 
lift it already has a trailer hitch on
it<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.200> tow<00:02:36.380> our<00:02:36.620> row<00:02:36.800> cons<00:02:37.070> back

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it so we can tow our row cons back

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.060 
it so we can tow our row cons back
behind<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:38.030> I'm<00:02:38.540> thinking<00:02:39.230> maybe<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.890> little

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
behind it I'm thinking maybe a little

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.840 
behind it I'm thinking maybe a little
