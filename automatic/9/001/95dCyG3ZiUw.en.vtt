the nexel of the arena we've taken that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
the nexel of the arena we've taken that
how<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> controls<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> game<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> giving

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
influenced what happens in these kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
influenced what happens in these kind of
transitional<00:00:49.860> pieces<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.520> they're<00:00:50.940> very

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
transitional pieces and they're very

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
transitional pieces and they're very
old-school<00:00:51.539> River<00:00:51.809> reminiscing<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
old-school River reminiscing and kind of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.760 
old-school River reminiscing and kind of
even<00:00:53.039> more

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
even more

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.410 
even more
just<00:00:54.370> wanted<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.670> add<00:00:54.790> another<00:00:55.090> layer<00:00:55.390> of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
just wanted to add another layer of

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.350 
just wanted to add another layer of
complexity<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.580> iteration<00:00:58.060> because

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
complexity to it it is iteration because

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.180 
complexity to it it is iteration because
that's<00:00:58.570> what<00:00:58.720> we<00:00:58.780> can<00:00:58.930> do<00:00:59.050> right<00:00:59.500> right<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.920> as

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
that's what we can do right right and as

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.380 
that's what we can do right right and as
you're<00:01:00.370> falling<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.760> also<00:01:01.000> have<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.330> ability

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
you're falling you also have the ability

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.600 
you're falling you also have the ability
to<00:01:01.660> fill<00:01:02.200> up<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.470> meter<00:01:02.860> on<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.100> side<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.400> screen

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
to fill up a meter on the side of screen

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.220 
to fill up a meter on the side of screen
which<00:01:03.850> if<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.210> fill<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.780> right<00:01:04.960> level

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
which if you fill it to the right level

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.380 
which if you fill it to the right level
you<00:01:05.350> can<00:01:05.650> pull<00:01:06.100> off<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.250> super<00:01:06.670> yeah<00:01:07.030> every

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
you can pull off a super yeah every

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.310 
you can pull off a super yeah every
character<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:07.810> going<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.140> their<00:01:08.290> own

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
character is going to have their own

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.170 
character is going to have their own
specific<00:01:08.650> special<00:01:09.430> move<00:01:09.580> in<00:01:09.790> free<00:01:10.000> fall

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
specific special move in free fall

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.490 
specific special move in free fall
combat<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.780> know<00:01:10.900> for<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> Green<00:01:11.350> Lantern

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
combat I know for the Green Lantern

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.530 
combat I know for the Green Lantern
because<00:01:12.070> reinterred<00:01:12.520> is<00:01:12.670> like<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> saw<00:01:13.210> you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
because reinterred is like a saw you

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.760 
because reinterred is like a saw you
know<00:01:13.660> yeah<00:01:13.900> it's<00:01:14.110> really<00:01:14.410> really<00:01:14.620> cool

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
know yeah it's really really cool

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.840 
know yeah it's really really cool
there's<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.040> lot<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.190> cool<00:01:15.430> things<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.790> are

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
there's a lot of cool things that are

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
there's a lot of cool things that are
going<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.000> happen<00:01:16.120> in<00:01:16.390> there<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:16.660> think

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
going to happen in there and I think

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.940 
going to happen in there and I think
players<00:01:17.050> are<00:01:17.229> going<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> look<00:01:17.530> forward<00:01:17.800> to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
players are going to look forward to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.500 
players are going to look forward to
actually<00:01:18.070> building<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.030> meter<00:01:19.330> and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
actually building up that meter and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.820 
actually building up that meter and
pulling<00:01:19.810> off<00:01:19.930> those<00:01:20.080> special<00:01:20.470> yet<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.740> the

pulling off those special yet in the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.140 
pulling off those special yet in the
middle<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.250> fight<00:01:21.460> definitely<00:01:22.060> definitely

fun another mode that we have is close

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.580 
fun another mode that we have is close
combat<00:01:24.760> this<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.390> more<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.810> tighter<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
combat this is more of a tighter and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.590 
combat this is more of a tighter and
close<00:01:27.070> fighting<00:01:27.400> where<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.240> camera<00:01:28.509> actually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
close fighting where the camera actually

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.999 
close fighting where the camera actually
comes<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:29.020> really<00:01:29.229> tight<00:01:29.470> between<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.890> two

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009
