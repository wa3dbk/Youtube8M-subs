solving<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.290> vehicle<00:00:09.650> will<00:00:10.190> do<00:00:10.310> that<00:00:10.490> by

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
solving the vehicle will do that by

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.460 
solving the vehicle will do that by
first<00:00:10.850> just<00:00:11.150> since<00:00:11.390> across<00:00:11.720> this<00:00:11.900> harness<00:00:12.320> and

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
first just since across this harness and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.180 
first just since across this harness and
that's<00:00:12.590> just<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:12.950> keep<00:00:13.100> all<00:00:13.310> of<00:00:13.340> our<00:00:13.550> wiring

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that's just to keep all of our wiring

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:27.180 
that's just to keep all of our wiring
need<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.760> clean-looking

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.040 

and<00:00:27.670> this<00:00:27.789> is<00:00:27.940> what<00:00:28.090> your<00:00:28.240> starter<00:00:28.570> disabled

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
and this is what your starter disabled

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.810 
and this is what your starter disabled
relay<00:00:29.350> should<00:00:29.410> look<00:00:29.740> like<00:00:29.920> before<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.369> install

and pull that wire out the next thing I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.170 
and pull that wire out the next thing I
want<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:45.919> do<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.159> look<00:02:46.310> for<00:02:46.370> my<00:02:46.609> ground<00:02:46.939> wire

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
want to do is look for my ground wire

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.959 
want to do is look for my ground wire
directly<00:02:48.049> above<00:02:48.590> where<00:02:48.889> my<00:02:49.189> power<00:02:49.430> wire<00:02:49.730> goes

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:49.969 
directly above where my power wire goes

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.140 
directly above where my power wire goes
in<00:02:50.269> as<00:02:50.989> an<00:02:51.230> empty<00:02:51.439> slot<00:02:51.769> some<00:02:52.519> cars<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.969> may<00:02:53.090> be

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
in as an empty slot some cars it may be

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.899 
in as an empty slot some cars it may be
empty<00:02:53.419> some<00:02:53.780> cars<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.199> may<00:02:54.349> not<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.730> either

empty some cars it may not but it either
rate<00:02:56.359> you're<00:02:56.569> gonna<00:02:56.629> go<00:02:56.870> above<00:02:57.199> where<00:02:57.859> the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
rate you're gonna go above where the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.890 
rate you're gonna go above where the
power<00:02:58.189> wire<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:58.909> you're<00:02:59.180> gonna<00:02:59.269> go<00:02:59.510> over

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
power wire was and you're gonna go over

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.830 
power wire was and you're gonna go over
four<00:03:00.199> slots<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.069> 1<00:03:01.400> 2<00:03:02.329> 3<00:03:03.319> 4<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.969> fourth<00:03:05.269> slot

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
four slots so 1 2 3 4 the fourth slot

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.259 
four slots so 1 2 3 4 the fourth slot
will<00:03:06.109> always<00:03:06.379> be<00:03:06.560> your<00:03:06.739> ground<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.669> I<00:03:07.849> flip<00:03:08.120> the
