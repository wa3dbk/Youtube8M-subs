00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
of course the big free wheel one but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.799 
of course the big free wheel one but
this<00:00:37.219> is<00:00:37.430> perfect<00:00:38.090> if<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:38.329> don't<00:00:38.540> have<00:00:38.690> the

yellow team old crystal boards are here
cleaned<00:00:53.989> off<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.590> chips<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.449> edge

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
cleaned off the chips the edge

connectors<00:00:57.370> reflow<00:00:58.370> solder<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.910> have<00:00:59.059> two

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
connectors reflow solder you have two

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.139

reflow<00:00:59.539> all<00:00:59.780> these<00:01:00.260> connectors<00:01:01.000> okay<00:01:02.000> it

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
reflow all these connectors okay it

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.610 
reflow all these connectors okay it
doesn't<00:01:02.480> use<00:01:02.629> these<00:01:02.809> obviously<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.469> is

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
doesn't use these obviously this is

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.190 
doesn't use these obviously this is
their<00:01:03.829> board<00:01:04.039> system<00:01:04.520> very<00:01:05.119> clever<00:01:05.510> idea<00:01:05.750> they

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
their board system very clever idea they

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.050 
their board system very clever idea they
used<00:01:06.439> these<00:01:06.680> same<00:01:06.920> boards<00:01:07.369> for<00:01:07.549> multiple

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
used these same boards for multiple

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.630 
used these same boards for multiple
teams<00:01:08.270> same<00:01:09.110> bottom<00:01:09.530> board<00:01:09.740> top<00:01:10.189> board<00:01:10.490> is

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
teams same bottom board top board is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.670 
teams same bottom board top board is
slightly<00:01:10.909> different<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.510> each<00:01:11.540> one<00:01:11.689> but<00:01:12.500> these

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
slightly different in each one but these

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.890 
slightly different in each one but these
this<00:01:13.010> is<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.340> two<00:01:13.610> wheel<00:01:13.880> version<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
this is the two wheel version so the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.050 
this is the two wheel version so the
chips<00:01:15.170> actually<00:01:15.650> say<00:01:15.890> them<00:01:15.950> two<00:01:16.790> wheel

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
chips actually say them two wheel

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.390 
chips actually say them two wheel
version<00:01:17.600> because<00:01:18.380> obviously<00:01:18.770> as<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.369> can

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
version because obviously as you can

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.140 
version because obviously as you can
guess<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:20.000> have<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> put<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:22.939> machine

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
guess you have to put in to this machine

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.300 
guess you have to put in to this machine
there<00:01:23.479> were<00:01:23.600> three<00:01:23.960> cars<00:01:24.530> coming<00:01:24.950> up<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
there were three cars coming up on the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.370 
there were three cars coming up on the
screen<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.000> that's<00:01:26.540> just<00:01:26.720> slight<00:01:26.990> different

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
screen so that's just slight different

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.140 
screen so that's just slight different
for<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.590> programming<00:01:28.100> we've<00:01:28.729> put<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:28.970> new

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
for the programming we've put a new

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.539 
for the programming we've put a new
power<00:01:29.450> supply<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.259> always<00:01:30.350> liked<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.860> that

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
power supply and I always liked it that

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.980 
power supply and I always liked it that
they<00:01:31.700> had<00:01:31.880> their<00:01:32.030> power<00:01:32.270> switch<00:01:32.540> right<00:01:32.780> here

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
they had their power switch right here

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.870 
they had their power switch right here
out<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.409> open<00:01:33.710> won't<00:01:33.890> depend<00:01:34.189> over<00:01:34.610> and

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
out of the open won't depend over and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.399 
out of the open won't depend over and
get<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.509> we<00:01:35.600> have<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> good<00:01:36.110> old<00:01:36.259> reliable

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
get it we have a good old reliable

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.760 
get it we have a good old reliable
