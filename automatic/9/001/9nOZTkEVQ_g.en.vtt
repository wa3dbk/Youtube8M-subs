of<00:04:22.449> them<00:04:22.569> there<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.810> guess<00:04:23.229> I've<00:04:23.590> only<00:04:23.770> got<00:04:23.949> two

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
of them there I guess I've only got two

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.350 
of them there I guess I've only got two
more<00:04:24.250> left<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.669> pause<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.150> resume<00:04:26.699> um<00:04:27.699> yes<00:04:28.210> I

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
more left so I pause and resume um yes I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.899 
more left so I pause and resume um yes I
got<00:04:28.509> two<00:04:28.750> more<00:04:28.900> they're<00:04:29.220> some<00:04:30.220> people<00:04:30.699> they

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
got two more they're some people they

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.320 
got two more they're some people they
use<00:04:31.650> heavy<00:04:32.650> classes<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.550> come<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:33.970> kill<00:04:34.180> you

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
use heavy classes and come and kill you

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.860 
use heavy classes and come and kill you
so<00:04:35.110> what<00:04:35.319> I<00:04:35.620> tend<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.610> do<00:04:36.819> is<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.389> sit<00:04:37.569> here

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
so what I tend to do is just sit here

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.290 
so what I tend to do is just sit here
have<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:38.830> bloke<00:04:39.129> sit<00:04:39.460> there<00:04:39.639> for<00:04:39.849> a<00:04:39.879> bit<00:04:40.060> till

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
have this bloke sit there for a bit till

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.899 
have this bloke sit there for a bit till
he<00:04:40.360> goes<00:04:40.539> some<00:04:40.960> minutes<00:04:41.409> or<00:04:42.190> even<00:04:42.250> something

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
he goes some minutes or even something

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.580 
he goes some minutes or even something
around<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.389> see<00:04:43.780> no<00:04:44.110> one<00:04:44.259> looks<00:04:44.440> like

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
around that see no one looks like

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.200 
around that see no one looks like
they've<00:04:44.710> got<00:04:44.800> heavy<00:04:45.009> classes<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:45.729> I'll<00:04:45.909> move

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
they've got heavy classes so I'll move

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.480 
they've got heavy classes so I'll move
him<00:04:46.360> over<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:47.199> reason<00:04:47.620> for<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:48.039> some

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
him over the reason for that is some

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.490 
him over the reason for that is some
people<00:04:48.849> just<00:04:49.060> desire<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.690> cannon<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.259> and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
people just desire to cannon you and

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.189 
people just desire to cannon you and
start<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.280> kill<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.759> off<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.240> if<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.900> die

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
start and kill you off and if you die

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.339 
start and kill you off and if you die
before<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:54.430> time<00:04:54.759> hits<00:04:55.180> 26<00:04:55.780> minutes<00:04:56.169> you

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
before the time hits 26 minutes you

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.219 
before the time hits 26 minutes you
won't<00:04:56.560> get<00:04:56.710> any<00:04:56.919> points<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.930> that's<00:04:59.110> why

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
won't get any points and so that's why

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.330 
won't get any points and so that's why
you<00:04:59.289> won't<00:04:59.440> want<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.770> make<00:04:59.979> sure<00:05:00.099> no<00:05:00.280> new

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
you won't want to make sure no new

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.189 
you won't want to make sure no new
classes<00:05:00.849> die<00:05:00.969> so<00:05:01.210> if<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.389> get<00:05:01.539> him<00:05:01.690> chase<00:05:01.930> down

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
classes die so if you get him chase down

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.809 
classes die so if you get him chase down
you<00:05:02.440> know<00:05:02.530> just<00:05:02.710> run<00:05:02.949> just<00:05:02.979> don't<00:05:03.520> even<00:05:03.699> give

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
you know just run just don't even give

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:04.439 
you know just run just don't even give
him<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:03.969> chance

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
him a chance

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.510 
him a chance
so<00:05:04.569> I'll<00:05:04.690> resume<00:05:05.110> once<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.889> time<00:05:06.099> remaining

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
so I'll resume once the time remaining

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.980 
so I'll resume once the time remaining
gets<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.759> 26<00:05:07.240> minutes<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.659> I'll<00:05:07.810> show<00:05:07.960> you

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
gets to 26 minutes and I'll show you

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.570

twenty<00:06:59.460> six<00:06:59.639> minutes<00:07:00.030> right<00:07:00.300> see<00:07:00.870> I<00:07:00.900> gained<00:07:01.289> a

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:01.439 
twenty six minutes right see I gained a

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.830 
twenty six minutes right see I gained a
rank<00:07:01.650> but<00:07:02.430> you<00:07:02.580> can<00:07:02.729> only<00:07:02.939> gain<00:07:03.270> I<00:07:03.539> think<00:07:03.750> it's

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
rank but you can only gain I think it's

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.809

a<00:07:03.870> maximum<00:07:04.319> of<00:07:04.439> twelve<00:07:04.830> ranks<00:07:05.159> now<00:07:05.370> so<00:07:05.669> don't

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 
a maximum of twelve ranks now so don't

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:07.429 
a maximum of twelve ranks now so don't
just<00:07:06.060> go<00:07:06.180> trying<00:07:06.509> to<00:07:06.569> win<00:07:06.689> every<00:07:07.080> game<00:07:07.110> because

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:07.439 
just go trying to win every game because

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.230 
just go trying to win every game because
you'll<00:07:07.740> just<00:07:07.949> be<00:07:08.099> cap<00:07:08.340> to<00:07:08.550> twelve<00:07:08.909> so<00:07:09.180> you

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
you'll just be cap to twelve so you

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.869 
you'll just be cap to twelve so you
