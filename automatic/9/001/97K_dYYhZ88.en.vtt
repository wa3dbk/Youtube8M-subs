difference it's a huge difference it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.060 
difference it's a huge difference it
won't<00:02:54.510> work<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> difference<00:02:55.860> between<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
won't work it's a difference between a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.400 
won't work it's a difference between a
working<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.550> not<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.780> minecraft<00:02:58.260> is

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.810 
working and not so if your minecraft is
different<00:02:58.770> or<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:58.980> library<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.490> different

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
different or your library is different

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.940 
different or your library is different
you<00:02:59.910> renamed<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.810> fine<00:03:01.050> you're

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you renamed it which is fine you're

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.400 
you renamed it which is fine you're
going<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> want<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.660> browse<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.170> just

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
going to want to a browse or be just

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.900 
going to want to a browse or be just
change<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.770> back<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.100> just<00:03:05.340> changed<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.790> back

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
change it back I just changed it back

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.260 
change it back I just changed it back
because<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.240> really<00:03:06.570> don't<00:03:06.750> care<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.350> much<00:03:08.270> ok

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
because I really don't care that much ok

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.540 
because I really don't care that much ok
so<00:03:09.870> once<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.440> see<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.100> checked

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
so once you see that all that is checked

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.690 
so once you see that all that is checked
then<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.240> can<00:03:12.390> hit<00:03:12.540> install<00:03:13.050> as<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.490> see

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
then you can hit install as you can see

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.870 
then you can hit install as you can see
i<00:03:14.910> hit<00:03:15.180> install<00:03:15.570> by<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> way<00:03:16.590> usually<00:03:17.430> don't
