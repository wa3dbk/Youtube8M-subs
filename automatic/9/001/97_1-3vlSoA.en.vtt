00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.640
 this is the way to advise alakrana and in little mount it and pokémon 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.159
 Diamond 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:14.240
 and for that we have to go to the combat zone flying directly or by boat 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.410
 for it we will have to have the little monake more complete the little esteem that 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.609
 it is not complete 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.849
 and go to route 225 that is around here 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 we passed this part 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.930
 i here already being on route 225 we get exactly 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.970
 to 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.650
 was we went down one step and climbed 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.460
 three times 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.550
 how were 2 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.980
 and three 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 we get in the grass 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 and we press select 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.360
 once pressed we look for a pokémon contract against which to fight inside the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.710
 grass 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.650
 moment we are taking a little 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.300
 there is 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 i 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.870
 ana as you can see 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 it's dear cra and if it does not come out the first 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.530
 Once this one comes out, a battle usually takes place the second and lopo of the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.620
 we found in the ibex and back and 2 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.040
 and because it's a gimmick to a gaming computer crash 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.820
 normally the first one is trapped using or any kind of 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.790
 dd 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 Dean said to hear in our case we will use a mask in case 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.420
 perhaps 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.939
 as I usually say windows are trapped does not mean that we always 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.970
 we put in the bag 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.850
 coke walsh 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.590
 master goal 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 we use it and we will see if we are lucky the potato papa we cover the first 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990
 in tintín 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 efe perfect winning catches us to the first 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.490
 As you can see, the trick is very simple 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.250
 guided I say that if you do not go out the first time on the lawn you keep looking 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 again 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.579
 good maya ball the pokédex 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.319
 And also go to the usual box that has been given for pisi and we want 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.129
 put it mote 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.670
 luckily it is already if we get embraces and good to be been all 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.720
 Thank you
