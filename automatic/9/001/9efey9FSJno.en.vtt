when<00:00:14.150> you<00:00:14.269> get<00:00:14.420> your<00:00:14.540> file<00:00:14.780> stitcher<00:00:15.379> it<00:00:15.620> comes

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
when you get your file stitcher it comes

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.429 
when you get your file stitcher it comes
in<00:00:16.040> a<00:00:16.189> delightful<00:00:16.970> little<00:00:17.000> box<00:00:17.450> which<00:00:18.080> when

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
in a delightful little box which when

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.620 
in a delightful little box which when
you<00:00:18.590> undo<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.150> reveals<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.590> instructions<00:00:21.590> and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
you undo it reveals the instructions and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.790 
you undo it reveals the instructions and
the<00:00:23.630> flower<00:00:23.869> stitcher<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.310> instructions<00:00:26.090> are

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
the flower stitcher the instructions are

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.920 
the flower stitcher the instructions are
pretty<00:00:27.800> good<00:00:28.100> but<00:00:28.850> hopefully<00:00:29.750> this

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
pretty good but hopefully this

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.700 
pretty good but hopefully this
presentation<00:00:30.640> will<00:00:31.640> allow<00:00:32.180> you<00:00:32.239> to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
presentation will allow you to

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.009 
presentation will allow you to
understand<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:36.410> foot<00:00:36.680> even<00:00:36.980> more<00:00:37.840> when<00:00:38.840> you

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
understand the foot even more when you

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.680 
understand the foot even more when you
get<00:00:39.199> it<00:00:39.379> out<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.830> Box<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:40.430> will<00:00:40.699> find<00:00:41.180> that

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
get it out to the Box you will find that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.369 
get it out to the Box you will find that
this<00:00:41.930> nut<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.160> is<00:00:43.640> very<00:00:44.120> tight<00:00:44.480> it's<00:00:44.930> factory

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
this nut is is very tight it's factory

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.020 
this nut is is very tight it's factory
tightened<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.010> might<00:00:46.309> need<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.670> find<00:00:46.850> a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
tightened so you might need to find a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.900 
tightened so you might need to find a
screwdriver<00:00:47.329> with<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:49.160> fit<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.550> slot<00:00:49.879> here

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
screwdriver with a to fit the slot here

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.950 
screwdriver with a to fit the slot here
just<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.050> loosen<00:00:51.289> it<00:00:51.760> it's<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.120> nut<00:00:53.539> that

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
just to loosen it it's this nut that

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.180 
just to loosen it it's this nut that
allows<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.829> movement<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.360> bar<00:00:56.690> that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
allows the movement of the bar that

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.189 
allows the movement of the bar that
controls<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.579> diameter<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.629> circle

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
controls the diameter of the circle

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.709 
controls the diameter of the circle
you'll<00:01:00.980> notice<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.610> there's<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.910> minus<00:01:02.420> sign

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
you'll notice that there's a minus sign

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.370 
you'll notice that there's a minus sign
and<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.590> plus<00:01:03.890> sign<00:01:04.449> -<00:01:05.449> obviously<00:01:05.750> makes<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
and a plus sign - obviously makes the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.370 
and a plus sign - obviously makes the
circle<00:01:06.770> slightly<00:01:07.160> smaller<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.000> plus

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
circle slightly smaller the plus

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.960 
circle slightly smaller the plus
enlarges<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.560> when<00:01:10.369> you've<00:01:10.550> decided<00:01:10.789> on<00:01:11.570> your

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
enlarges it when you've decided on your

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.150 
enlarges it when you've decided on your
diameter<00:01:13.970> then<00:01:14.450> move<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.289> bar<00:01:15.500> over<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.069> then

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
diameter then move the bar over and then

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.480 
diameter then move the bar over and then
just<00:01:16.429> finger<00:01:17.090> tighten<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.319> nut<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.160> that's

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
just finger tighten the nut and that's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.919 
just finger tighten the nut and that's
in<00:01:19.880> position<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.580> move<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.209> nut<00:01:23.569> and

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
in position you can move that nut and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.699 
in position you can move that nut and
move<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:25.780> mechanism<00:01:26.780> when<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:27.110> actually<00:01:27.319> on

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
move the mechanism when it's actually on

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:30.760 
move the mechanism when it's actually on
the<00:01:27.950> machine<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.750> don't<00:01:30.229> think<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.530> you're

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
the machine so don't think that you're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.580 
the machine so don't think that you're
set<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.369> one<00:01:32.530> diameter<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:34.729> lever<00:01:35.119> here<00:01:35.630> fits

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
set to one diameter this lever here fits

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.749 
set to one diameter this lever here fits
above<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.160> needle<00:01:37.459> bar<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.390> when<00:01:39.380> you're

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
above the needle bar and when you're

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.309 
above the needle bar and when you're
putting<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> machine<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.140> may

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
putting it on to the machine you may

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.290 
putting it on to the machine you may
find<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.220> need<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.580> lower<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.970> needle

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
find that you need to lower the needle

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.419 
find that you need to lower the needle
so<00:01:44.929> that<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.380> actually<00:01:45.560> place<00:01:46.069> this

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
so that you can actually place this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.359 
so that you can actually place this
lever<00:01:46.729> above<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.750> bar<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.610> needle<00:01:50.060> bar<00:01:50.209> lift

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
lever above that bar the needle bar lift

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.059 
lever above that bar the needle bar lift
allows<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.970> foot<00:01:53.239> to<00:01:53.270> move<00:01:54.200> around<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.890> you

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
allows the foot to move around and you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.389 
allows the foot to move around and you
can<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.340> here<00:01:55.910> how<00:01:56.509> by<00:01:56.750> lifting<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.440> bar<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
can see here how by lifting the bar the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.479 
can see here how by lifting the bar the
little<00:01:58.759> thought<00:01:59.330> there<00:01:59.630> walks<00:02:00.170> around<00:02:00.860> the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
little thought there walks around the

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.940 
little thought there walks around the
milled<00:02:02.239> surface<00:02:03.099> just<00:02:04.179> following<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.390> lovely
