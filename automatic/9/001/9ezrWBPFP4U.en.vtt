 he will choose one day after you 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.029
 do it too 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.140
 the image that the courtroom 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.300
 I have divorced formalities 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.730
 what is the reason for the presence 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.599
 but finally to a job in t goor the best shooter from ajax against real 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.849
 very nice story but there is one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.630
 the video 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.230
 it seems clear to me that year 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.490
 the passage of time 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.080
 acomo 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 in 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.370
 early April and May 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 that for defending battlefield 3 the construction costs 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.190
 on Friday where the builders of mine made the working group that by far the better 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.250
 penalties for murder with 3 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.990
 Games are always looking for the next big thing a new experience that one 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.700
 Part of it all a relationship in the property should be this for the purpose 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.810
 weatherman 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.980
 east corner 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.390
 the engine appears new ford and cindy that 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 5 everyone blown away wild knit fish are as beautiful as you but now ugly 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 old characters from the children's roles become dixit de croo 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.000
 the job market I mean 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500
 and in a row but what is this going to work again 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.799
 the top thirty shots 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.220
 the speculation you this is 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.380
 You don't even look and the single turns out Padberg is trying 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.789
 fully self-contained what will it be 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.429
 full experience at the end of the trusted site or as with the costs 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.170
 10 euros 6 we had 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 a script the terrain from behind id job within five hours 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.090
 the netherlands lived for me 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.700
 purely by itself alone therefore is already with the manufacturer 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.619
 and very important you think of the telephony film 3 and the new one for spec v in 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.350
 into the fog 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.540
 damage that survivors does not intend to open only that one door 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.720
 just that for using an asx file the airways of all the time 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.450
 damage 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.880
 and you can also find a retarded one that is likely to come after a spearhead 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.740
 free in the way which suddenly makes you another 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.659
 we have to pack 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.090
 In addition, the match is much bigger and that means more anyway 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 have tactics and yet a point became unwell we are already known from deep striker 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.039
 already believe that i am in now 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.769
 at the film three were logging though it is secretly at the head he does that already 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.749
 not to ask for money with phones an oil layer free a treasure 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.749
 if I just don't sit at their post 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.019
 in my head 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.379
 I gave me a lot of free time, but I was introduced to the club record 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:35.879
 and look 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.620
 wal mart a win from the old song it's the same game from last year 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.239
 the year before for which he got chewed badly I have not seen it 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.020
 not looking forward to it 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 at the top three is the something new the atmosphere is the jail is full at the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.889
 filter 2 we have had to wait a while again 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.749
 It is a total war vehicles and jeeps Pentecost aircraft jets 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.349
 helicopters large letters next game instead of always the same 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.069
 chewed 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.449
 somewhat shorter in dust 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.949
 yes i don't like us and i don't like 3 what you see is just weak bullshit 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.929
 Battlefield 3 is just a slow stood before the real friend pushed the 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:29.490
 giving substance to it is nice sometimes you just have to walk for minutes 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.669
 furthermore your guests will encounter the people almost working 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.170
 not both after both 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.400
 bono there will be 3 fast action fat cool game workplaces play fast sports

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.409
 many options online, of course you will be disappointed 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.029

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:19.530

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.069
 and for the extension with if you 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.229
 a premium edition comes utility 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.110
 the payment index especially the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.889
 now the neighborhood citizens 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.990
 why is there 3 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.250
 is going to say the second time to buy four times as much 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.330
 of battlefield 3 extra or for sale it is not about the aow april and the 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 counselors to take dance lessons a little to say angeles john the world's best 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.450
 Shooter has broken to sell to go play well and it also turned out later 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.439
 that the army is consumer and security 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.969
 because of hurricane michael schumacher all in all a nice trip and i know that 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.189
 a lot you have what once in a row there is still no official it 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.439
 proof that our task is no, you can say what you think about it the concern 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.720
 reported that competing against each other in our opinion 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.909
 that saves the 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.639
 I have enough euros 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.990
 I think you're with me 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 halfway 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.610
 who to the capital 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.389
 heart for battlefield 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.949
 sir block 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.020
 football at half past one 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.930
 what do those guys think 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.930
 all indices backwards 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.819
 actually this is a matter 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.819
 I prefer a study about it 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.419
 can your rest be placed in the crash 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.120
 because in this not decided 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.379
 may you say 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.400
 who is the winner 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.680
 for time the 4 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.659
 also the largest for eighteen months 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.659
 because I am ready for it 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:54.779
 6 to 8 percent 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:59.289
 Fighting The question Heijmans is completely making for the future 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.890
 That's the lowest rates the meeting has this game has 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.539
 neither of them became titanic against a four minute delay 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.219
 so we have time again for it to be fun, but it does hit 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.689
 more twenty minutes to play 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.569
 you go anyway though it is both super fat I have to choose the 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:18.559
 arts 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.719
 that he didn't mind 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.639
 I remember
