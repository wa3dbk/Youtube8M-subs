00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
kind of small but liquid or gel eyeliner

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.720 
kind of small but liquid or gel eyeliner
lasts<00:03:32.330> four<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.960> verse<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:34.040> I'm<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.490> really

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
lasts four and verse so I'm not really

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.520

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
really like it it's not like super super

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.950 
really like it it's not like super super
black<00:04:01.310> but

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.230 

it<00:04:06.530> like<00:04:06.710> looks<00:04:07.040> nice

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.370 

ah<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:14.050> just<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.500> poking<00:04:15.280> something<00:04:15.580> uh<00:04:17.700> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
ah I just like poking something uh and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060

honestly<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.590> brush<00:04:20.920> isn't<00:04:22.590> horrible<00:04:23.590> either

honestly the brush isn't horrible either

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.730 
honestly the brush isn't horrible either
it<00:04:24.580> makes<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:25.000> easier<00:04:25.420> for<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:26.140> like<00:04:26.320> smudge

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
it makes it easier for it to like smudge

like on one eye um the brush is okay I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.680 
like on one eye um the brush is okay I
would<00:04:59.670> rather<00:04:59.820> have<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.240> angled<00:05:00.570> eyeliner

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
would rather have the angled eyeliner

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.600 
would rather have the angled eyeliner
brush<00:05:00.930> because<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.440> feel<00:05:01.680> like<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:02.010> could<00:05:02.490> do<00:05:02.580> a

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
brush because I feel like I could do a

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.330 
brush because I feel like I could do a
better<00:05:03.440> thing<00:05:04.440> like<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.740> feel<00:05:04.890> like<00:05:04.950> this<00:05:05.130> is

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
better thing like I feel like this is

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.980 
better thing like I feel like this is
kind<00:05:05.700> of<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.120> little<00:05:06.270> bit<00:05:06.360> thicker<00:05:06.690> than<00:05:06.810> I

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
kind of a little bit thicker than I

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.400 
kind of a little bit thicker than I
normally<00:05:07.200> wear<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.860> it's<00:05:08.010> not<00:05:09.410> completely

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
normally wear and it's not completely

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.570 
normally wear and it's not completely
even<00:05:13.610> it's<00:05:14.610> not<00:05:14.700> horrible<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:17.430> just

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
even it's not horrible but it's just

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.580 
even it's not horrible but it's just
like<00:05:17.700> not<00:05:18.420> really<00:05:18.900> how<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> do<00:05:19.230> my<00:05:19.410> eyeliner

a pretty good product so yeah that's

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.540 
a pretty good product so yeah that's
what<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.140> looks<00:05:28.260> like<00:05:28.380> on<00:05:28.530> one<00:05:28.920> eye<00:05:28.950> I'm<00:05:29.430> going

final<00:05:36.570> thoughts<00:05:36.750> with<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.990> guys<00:05:37.170> one<00:05:37.500> is<00:05:37.620> a

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
final thoughts with you guys one is a

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.070 
final thoughts with you guys one is a
little<00:05:37.980> bit<00:05:38.100> more<00:05:38.310> expensive<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:39.900> feel

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
little bit more expensive and I feel

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.350 
little bit more expensive and I feel
like<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.320> Maybelline<00:05:40.740> one<00:05:40.920> wasn't<00:05:41.310> as<00:05:41.640> creamy

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
like the Maybelline one wasn't as creamy

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.680 
like the Maybelline one wasn't as creamy
uh<00:05:42.770> we<00:05:43.770> will<00:05:43.980> see<00:05:44.430> how<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.030> works<00:05:45.480> out

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
uh we will see how that works out

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.300 
uh we will see how that works out
because<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.260> feel<00:05:46.290> like<00:05:46.650> if<00:05:46.800> it's<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:47.040> little<00:05:47.160> bit

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
because I feel like if it's a little bit

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.850 
because I feel like if it's a little bit
creamier<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:47.940> might<00:05:48.260> transfer<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.530> top<00:05:49.710> of

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
creamier it might transfer to the top of

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.620 
creamier it might transfer to the top of
my<00:05:49.920> eyelids<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.640> might<00:05:50.820> smudge<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.120> little<00:05:51.390> bit

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
my eyelids and might smudge a little bit

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.070 
my eyelids and might smudge a little bit
so<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:51.930> don't<00:05:52.170> know<00:05:52.290> um<00:05:53.570> obviously<00:05:54.570> I'm<00:05:54.900> not

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
so I don't know um obviously I'm not

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.690 
so I don't know um obviously I'm not
like<00:05:55.290> going<00:05:55.470> planning<00:05:55.920> on<00:05:56.010> getting<00:05:56.220> wet<00:05:56.520> or

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
like going planning on getting wet or

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.190 
like going planning on getting wet or
going<00:05:56.880> in<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.060> water<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.510> I<00:05:57.540> don't<00:05:57.810> know<00:05:57.960> if<00:05:58.110> I

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
going in the water so I don't know if I

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.960 
going in the water so I don't know if I
can<00:05:58.260> really<00:05:58.530> tell<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:58.950> this<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.280> actually

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
can really tell you if this is actually

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.280 
can really tell you if this is actually
waterproof

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.310 
I'll see if I can test that out or
whatever<00:06:03.990> but<00:06:04.910> yeah<00:06:05.910> so<00:06:06.480> far<00:06:06.720> my<00:06:06.930> first

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
