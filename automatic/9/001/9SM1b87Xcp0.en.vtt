straight<00:01:22.750> away<00:01:22.840> you're<00:01:23.079> like<00:01:23.229> what<00:01:23.890> but<00:01:24.460> why

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
straight away you're like what but why

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.010 
straight away you're like what but why
what<00:01:25.810> was<00:01:26.020> ok<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.710> I'm<00:01:27.009> not<00:01:27.159> allowed<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.460> long

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
what was ok so I'm not allowed a long

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.429 
what was ok so I'm not allowed a long
length<00:01:29.020> just<00:01:29.710> 100<00:01:30.369> millimeter<00:01:30.729> lens<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:32.259> that

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
length just 100 millimeter lens but that

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.649 
length just 100 millimeter lens but that
just<00:01:32.710> doesn't<00:01:33.220> make<00:01:33.700> sense<00:01:33.850> because<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.570> is

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
just doesn't make sense because there is

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.660 
just doesn't make sense because there is
people<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> ship<00:01:35.439> with<00:01:36.310> a

people on the ship with a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
point-and-shoot switch ok maybe they

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.109 
point-and-shoot switch ok maybe they
don't<00:01:38.829> go<00:01:38.979> up<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.130> 100<00:01:39.429> millimeters<00:01:39.549> in<00:01:40.090> length

could<00:01:54.700> be<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.270> equivalent<00:01:55.599> of<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:56.020> thousand

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
could be the equivalent of a thousand

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.710 
could be the equivalent of a thousand
millimeter<00:01:57.549> range<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.179> you'd<00:01:58.299> get<00:01:58.479> from<00:01:58.509> a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
millimeter range that you'd get from a

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.830 
millimeter range that you'd get from a
digital<00:01:58.869> SLR<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.819> just<00:02:00.909> like<00:02:01.030> what<00:02:01.390> what

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
digital SLR so it's just like what what

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.889 
digital SLR so it's just like what what
was<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:02.770> they're<00:02:02.979> trying<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.490> achieve

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
was it that they're trying to achieve

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.880 
was it that they're trying to achieve
from<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:05.200> it's<00:02:05.289> like<00:02:05.439> whenever<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.740> get

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
from it so it's like whenever you get

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.649 
from it so it's like whenever you get
like<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.189> smaller<00:02:06.520> camera<00:02:06.849> amazing<00:02:07.390> it's<00:02:07.509> only

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
like a smaller camera amazing it's only

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.740 
like a smaller camera amazing it's only
like<00:02:07.810> four<00:02:08.170> millimeters<00:02:09.239> 250<00:02:10.239> millimeters

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
like four millimeters 250 millimeters

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.710 
like four millimeters 250 millimeters
saying<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.410> that's<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.269> 15-time<00:02:13.269> zoom

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
saying that that's like a 15-time zoom

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.770 
saying that that's like a 15-time zoom
but<00:02:14.500> when<00:02:14.799> you<00:02:14.950> factor<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.610> into<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.329> tiny

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
but when you factor that into the tiny

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.630 
but when you factor that into the tiny
size<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> sensor<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.069> effective

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
size of the sensor and the effective

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.270 
size of the sensor and the effective
focal<00:02:19.510> length<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.349> from<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.799> it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
focal length that you get from that it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.360 
focal length that you get from that it
suddenly<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.819> becomes<00:02:22.319> like<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.370> 400

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
suddenly that becomes like a 400

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.550 
suddenly that becomes like a 400
millimeter<00:02:24.970> lens<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.480> if<00:02:25.690> you're<00:02:26.140> inviting

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
millimeter lens so if you're inviting

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.990 
millimeter lens so if you're inviting
people<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.769> come<00:02:26.829> on<00:02:27.069> with<00:02:27.220> little<00:02:27.549> cameras

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
people to come on with little cameras

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.360 
people to come on with little cameras
that<00:02:28.690> doesn't<00:02:29.230> stop<00:02:29.530> them<00:02:29.560> from<00:02:29.769> having<00:02:30.100> an

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
that doesn't stop them from having an

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.849 
that doesn't stop them from having an
incredibly<00:02:31.000> long<00:02:31.359> reach<00:02:31.810> with<00:02:32.200> their<00:02:32.530> with<00:02:32.829> a

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
incredibly long reach with their with a

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.890 
incredibly long reach with their with a
cam<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.250> numbers<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.549> could<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.760> having<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.120> small

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
cam so numbers I could be having a small

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720 
cam so numbers I could be having a small
pointed<00:02:35.319> shoot<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.799> could<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.220> looking<00:02:36.459> at

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
pointed shoot and I could be looking at

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.059 
pointed shoot and I could be looking at
the<00:02:36.850> tiniest<00:02:37.329> details<00:02:37.840> somebody<00:02:38.350> at<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.739> very

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
the tiniest details somebody at the very

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.270 
the tiniest details somebody at the very
other<00:02:39.400> end<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.269> ship<00:02:40.920> because<00:02:41.920> I've<00:02:42.100> got<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
other end of the ship because I've got a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.129 
other end of the ship because I've got a
smaller<00:02:42.639> sensor<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.299> I've<00:02:43.359> got<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.660> further

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
smaller sensor and I've got that further

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.680 
smaller sensor and I've got that further
reach<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.889> the<00:02:44.920> mega<00:02:45.880> zoom<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.569> can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
reach with the mega zoom that you can

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.860 
reach with the mega zoom that you can
get<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.530> with<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> full-size<00:02:48.400> digital<00:02:49.209> SLR<00:02:49.660> and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
get but with a full-size digital SLR and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.470 
get but with a full-size digital SLR and
100<00:02:50.410> millimeter<00:02:50.739> lens<00:02:51.130> oh<00:02:51.430> no<00:02:51.790> no<00:02:52.239> that's<00:02:52.420> too

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
100 millimeter lens oh no no that's too

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.199 
100 millimeter lens oh no no that's too

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
long too long a lens so there's just

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.240 
long too long a lens so there's just
like<00:02:55.329> what<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> kind<00:02:57.069> of

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
like what what was that kind of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.660 
like what what was that kind of
Oh<00:02:58.690> protection<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.900> details<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:01.040> information

in her say that and also bill weren't

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.440 
in her say that and also bill weren't
restricted<00:03:04.490> on<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.820> ship<00:03:05.090> they're<00:03:05.300> allowed

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
restricted on the ship they're allowed

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.910 
restricted on the ship they're allowed
to<00:03:05.480> walk<00:03:05.780> around<00:03:05.810> anywhere<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.710> not<00:03:06.770> like

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
to walk around anywhere so it's not like

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.220 
to walk around anywhere so it's not like
oh<00:03:07.070> well<00:03:07.610> they're<00:03:07.760> getting<00:03:08.120> closer<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.540> things

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
oh well they're getting closer to things

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.360 
oh well they're getting closer to things
which<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.440> don't<00:03:09.560> want<00:03:09.770> them<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.980> cease<00:03:10.160> like

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
which you don't want them to cease like

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.070 
which you don't want them to cease like
people<00:03:10.580> can<00:03:10.730> go<00:03:10.910> up<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.360> certain<00:03:11.630> things<00:03:11.870> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
people can go up to certain things and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.230 
people can go up to certain things and
take<00:03:12.290> photos<00:03:12.530> right<00:03:13.310> there<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.820> then<00:03:13.940> it's

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
take photos right there and then it's

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.680 
take photos right there and then it's
just<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.080> random<00:03:16.150> arbitrary<00:03:17.150> thing<00:03:17.570> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
just what a random arbitrary thing to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.170 
just what a random arbitrary thing to
say<00:03:17.870> no<00:03:18.110> 100<00:03:18.590> millimeters<00:03:18.950> more<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.880> can't

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
say no 100 millimeters more you can't

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.910 
say no 100 millimeters more you can't
bring<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.600> if<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.720> had<00:03:20.840> your<00:03:20.959> 70<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.470> 200

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
bring it so if you had your 70 to 200

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.310 
bring it so if you had your 70 to 200
you<00:03:22.130> can't<00:03:22.459> take<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.820> onto<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.300> ship<00:03:23.600> like

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
you can't take it onto the ship like

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.960 
you can't take it onto the ship like
even<00:03:24.500> if<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.040> could<00:03:25.220> even<00:03:25.310> get<00:03:25.550> google

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
even if like you could even get google

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.540 
even if like you could even get google
map<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.810> shots<00:03:27.170> from<00:03:27.380> above<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.190> ship<00:03:28.400> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
see exactly the the layout of it and you

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.390 
see exactly the the layout of it and you
could<00:03:31.610> go<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:31.940> into<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.720> ship<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.110> take<00:03:34.040> like

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
could go on into the ship and take like

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.520 
could go on into the ship and take like
as<00:03:34.610> many<00:03:34.940> photos<00:03:35.330> as<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.750> wanted<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.260> just

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
as many photos as you wanted it's just

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.030 
as many photos as you wanted it's just
how<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.880> somehow<00:03:38.840> restricting<00:03:39.770> it<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.920> a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
how is somehow restricting it to a

what you get in there and Nick on d-4s
or<00:04:13.910> something<00:04:14.269> where<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.510> can<00:04:14.720> see<00:04:14.870> stuff

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
or something where you can see stuff

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.530 
or something where you can see stuff
which<00:04:15.380> I've<00:04:15.950> intentionally<00:04:16.609> turned<00:04:17.330> the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
which I've intentionally turned the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.630 
which I've intentionally turned the
lights<00:04:17.810> off<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.470> room<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.280> see

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
lights off in this room so you can see

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.580 
lights off in this room so you can see
all<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.850> blood<00:04:20.479> splattered<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.290> walls

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
all the blood splattered on the walls

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.040 
all the blood splattered on the walls
kind<00:04:21.890> of<00:04:22.010> stuff<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.000> like<00:04:23.030> obviously<00:04:23.690> probably

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
kind of stuff so like obviously probably

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.980 
kind of stuff so like obviously probably
the<00:04:24.110> bigger<00:04:24.380> danger<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:25.310> not<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.479> focal

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the bigger danger is not the focal

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.850 
the bigger danger is not the focal
length<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.440> your<00:04:27.590> lens<00:04:28.090> but<00:04:29.090> more<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.440> image

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
length of your lens but more the image

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.740 
length of your lens but more the image
the<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.400> information<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.030> your<00:04:32.300> your

the the information that your your

camera is able to capture I had you know

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600 
camera is able to capture I had you know
it<00:04:36.169> doesn't<00:04:36.500> depend<00:04:36.590> whether<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.310> got<00:04:37.460> a

it doesn't depend whether it's got a

it doesn't depend whether it's got a

which<00:04:43.880> are<00:04:44.030> pretty<00:04:44.240> dark<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.140> don't<00:04:45.380> want

which are pretty dark and you don't want

people to see in there that'd be

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.430 
people to see in there that'd be
probably<00:04:47.690> more<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.050> an<00:04:48.260> issue<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:49.490> just

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
probably more of an issue it's just

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.260 
probably more of an issue it's just
random<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:51.610> very<00:04:51.880> weird<00:04:53.670> have<00:04:54.670> any<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.060> you
