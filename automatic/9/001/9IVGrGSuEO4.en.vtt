00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
right from the get-go and these engines

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.780 
right from the get-go and these engines
were<00:01:02.129> originally<00:01:02.609> targeted<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:04.790> performance

v-max earn for the performance and the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.890 
v-max earn for the performance and the
aggressive<00:01:18.540> look<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.259> found<00:01:19.530> its<00:01:19.710> place<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
aggressive look it found its place in a

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
aggressive look it found its place in a
pontoon<00:01:21.900> segment<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> based<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.090> our

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
basically we call them X shaft which is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.600 
basically we call them X shaft which is
25<00:02:15.390> inch<00:02:15.600> shaft<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:17.100> length<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
25 inch shaft so the length of the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
25 inch shaft so the length of the
outboard<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.360> longer<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.830> will<00:02:20.040> allow<00:02:20.160> us

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
outboard is longer so this will allow us

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.050 
outboard is longer so this will allow us
to<00:02:20.880> offer<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.050> essential<00:02:22.770> power<00:02:22.950> into<00:02:23.700> other

what I mean by that is we do have the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
reliability if we made some changes to

our gear case to the clutch dogs

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.840 
our gear case to the clutch dogs
particularly<00:05:03.660> when<00:05:04.230> from<00:05:04.470> six<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.860> eight<00:05:04.980> for

particularly when from six to eight for

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.430 
particularly when from six to eight for
better<00:05:06.030> contact<00:05:06.540> point<00:05:06.870> in<00:05:07.080> terms<00:05:07.290> of

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
better contact point in terms of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.250 
better contact point in terms of
durability<00:05:08.070> as<00:05:08.880> well<00:05:08.940> as<00:05:09.510> what<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.720> can<00:05:09.960> find

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
durability as well as what you can find

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.100 
durability as well as what you can find
from<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.520> has<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> quieter<00:05:12.330> operation<00:05:12.540> at

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
from it is it has a quieter operation at

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.890 
from it is it has a quieter operation at
lower<00:05:13.320> speed<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.460> great<00:05:15.150> announcement<00:05:15.720> on

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
lower speed so great announcement on

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.860 
lower speed so great announcement on
that<00:05:16.650> engine
