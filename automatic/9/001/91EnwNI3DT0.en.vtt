decided to build over here but the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.670 
decided to build over here but the
reason<00:02:16.160> I'm<00:02:16.580> bringing<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.030> map<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:18.140> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
reason I'm bringing this map if you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.140 
reason I'm bringing this map if you
actually<00:02:18.890> walk<00:02:19.370> from<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.940> swollen<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.690> way

you know I'll show you in about two
seconds<00:02:26.010> when<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> stain<00:02:26.489> loads<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.599> comes<00:02:27.900> up

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
seconds when the stain loads or comes up

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
seconds when the stain loads or comes up
there<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.349> go<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.340> walk<00:02:29.700> follow

there you go if you just walk follow

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.270 
there you go if you just walk follow
this<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.569> shoreline<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.010> go<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this little shoreline and then go to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.580 
this little shoreline and then go to
that<00:02:32.519> sand<00:02:32.879> as<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.209> see<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.599> sort<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that sand as you see in the sort of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.910 
that sand as you see in the sort of
right<00:02:34.830> amount<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.489> your<00:02:35.879> screen<00:02:36.379> uh<00:02:37.379> when<00:02:37.830> you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
right amount of your screen uh when you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.000 
right amount of your screen uh when you
go<00:02:38.069> there<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.390> actually<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> 404<00:02:40.680> seed

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
go there this is actually the 404 seed

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.309 
go there this is actually the 404 seed
now<00:02:41.360> some<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.390> y'all<00:02:42.599> may<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.230> I'm

now some of y'all may know what I'm
talking<00:02:43.709> about<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.310> PC<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.200> 404

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
talking about from the PC but the 404

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.449 
talking about from the PC but the 404
seed<00:02:47.760> or<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.060> 404<00:02:48.569> challenge<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.379> what<00:02:50.310> it's

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
seed or the 404 challenge is what it's

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.420 
seed or the 404 challenge is what it's
really<00:02:50.610> called<00:02:51.230> what<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.349> is<00:02:52.500> somebody<00:02:53.129> found

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really called what it is somebody found

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.759 
really called what it is somebody found
the<00:02:53.640> seed<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.329> dig<00:02:54.660> under<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.410> graph

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
the seed and if you dig under the graph

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.830 
the seed and if you dig under the graph
you<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.069> dig<00:02:56.519> one<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> gravel<00:02:57.420> pieces<00:02:57.720> as

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you just dig one of the gravel pieces as

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.869 
you just dig one of the gravel pieces as
you'll<00:02:58.049> see<00:02:58.290> I'll<00:02:58.500> do<00:02:58.769> when<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.579> get<00:02:59.730> over

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
you'll see I'll do when we get over

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.349 
you'll see I'll do when we get over
there<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.560> whole<00:03:01.709> thing<00:03:01.769> falls<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:03.090> goes

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
there the whole thing falls and it goes

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.470 
there the whole thing falls and it goes
into<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:04.230> awesome<00:03:04.549> cave<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.879> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
into this really awesome cave and the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
into this really awesome cave and the
challenge<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.470> Steve<00:03:07.709> made<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> list<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
challenge is the Steve made a list of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.589 
challenge is the Steve made a list of
objectives<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.359> got<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.659> do<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:11.549> like<00:03:12.390> I

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
objectives that you got to do and like I

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.940 
objectives that you got to do and like I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
guess on the PC if you had you know each

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.979 
guess on the PC if you had you know each
challenge<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.549> did<00:03:17.730> or<00:03:18.000> each<00:03:18.299> objective<00:03:18.480> got

challenge you did or each objective got
you<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> score<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.269> you'd<00:03:21.870> post<00:03:22.200> your

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you a score and you know you'd post your

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
you a score and you know you'd post your
score<00:03:22.950> at<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.280> end<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.549> see<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.849> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
score at the end and see you got the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.250 
score at the end and see you got the
best<00:03:24.150> score<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.629> know<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.019> fun<00:03:25.230> little

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
best score you know just a fun little

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.259 
best score you know just a fun little
interactive<00:03:25.859> game<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.159> as<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.340> see<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:27.209> just

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
interactive game but as you see you just

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.720 
interactive game but as you see you just
did<00:03:27.540> one<00:03:27.780> thing<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.200> whole<00:03:28.380> log<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
did one thing in the whole log in the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.220 
did one thing in the whole log in the
middle<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.269> then<00:03:30.359> literally<00:03:30.660> everything

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
middle and then literally everything

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.920 
middle and then literally everything
falls<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.120> sometimes<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.359> didn't<00:03:33.569> notice<00:03:33.780> this

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
falls and sometimes I didn't notice this

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.629 
falls and sometimes I didn't notice this
the<00:03:34.230> water<00:03:34.530> shortage<00:03:34.859> just<00:03:35.160> gets<00:03:35.310> stucked

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
the water shortage just gets stucked

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.599 
the water shortage just gets stucked
right<00:03:35.910> there<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.980> dig

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
right there but you know you just dig

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.089 
right there but you know you just dig
some<00:03:38.910> blocks<00:03:39.780> around<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.650> should<00:03:40.829> fall

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
some blocks around it and it should fall

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.949 
some blocks around it and it should fall
down<00:03:41.129> and<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.819> easy<00:03:42.150> way<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.569> get

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
down and you have an easy way to get

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.610 
down and you have an easy way to get
down<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.849> is<00:03:45.060> actually<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.900> seed

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
down there and this is actually the seed

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500 
down there and this is actually the seed
I'm<00:03:47.250> gonna<00:03:47.669> be<00:03:47.790> doing<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> let's<00:03:48.269> play<00:03:48.389> I'm
