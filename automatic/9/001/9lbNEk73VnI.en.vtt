00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.500
 Hi everyone, I am luca and present you 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.700
 that my two friends of gabriele diego 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.520
 we are part of the problem a lot e 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.330
 we founded this group of ours 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.180
 d'angelo drivers team we have fiat 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.560
 500 vintage and we are passionate about 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.750
 these cars we decided to create 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.590
 all together with this medium as you can 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.590
 see behind us 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.879
 and born of a strange and bizarre idea of 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.539
 to create something other than 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.019
 the usual 500 we usually have 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.810
 got a frame from a suzuki santana 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.960
 thousand with an old 500 we created 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.270
 everything has been changed for everything 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 handcrafted with modifications that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.729
 we have almost 90 percent created us 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.740
 starting from the engine it remained anyway 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.090
 his we modified the bridges 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.970
 we made all the levers 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.619
 crafted tire wheels the exhaust is 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.039
 completely handmade in steel 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.890
 stainless 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.450
 then on the mechanical changes we have 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.270
 the reducer that has been modified with 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 the shortest ratio to succeed in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.520
 overcome obstacles with minimum speed 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.899
 these types of leverages we have 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.929
 we say self-built allows us to 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.670
 overcome obstacles 90 centimeters high for 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.149
 don't say a meter that it would be maybe a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.149
 bit too much 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.879
 we have added a water cooler 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.659
 rear with an internal control 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.900
 she also drives completely 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:53.439
 crafted the cushions arise 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.319
 also derived from iveco therefore i 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.290
 more and more trucks we have added a 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.290
 oil cooler for power steering 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.560
 starting from a pump that was due for 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.170
 automotive equipment not for 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.359
 heavy vehicles we have adapted everything 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.150
 on this machine we did one 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.940
 craft transmission for making 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.560
 of the joints of an iveco that have been 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.639
 suitably modified to be 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.639
 mounted on this vehicle
