go<00:01:05.309> size<00:01:05.640> comparison<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> regular<00:01:06.869> 3<00:01:07.140> x<00:01:07.290> 3<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
go size comparison to regular 3 x 3 is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
go size comparison to regular 3 x 3 is
pretty<00:01:09.420> much<00:01:09.510> exactly<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.320> size<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.240> to
