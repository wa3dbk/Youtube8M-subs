00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
okay so when he takes off right now he's

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay so when he takes off right now he's
gonna<00:00:03.689> power<00:00:04.049> break<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.879> just<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.970> little<00:00:06.210> bit

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
gonna power break it just a little bit

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.750 
gonna power break it just a little bit
so<00:00:07.080> hold<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.980> break<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.429> give<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.670> little

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
so hold the break and give it a little

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.570 
so hold the break and give it a little
gas<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.080> all<00:00:10.469> four<00:00:10.500> wheels<00:00:10.860> take<00:00:11.219> off<00:00:11.429> at

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
gas so that all four wheels take off at

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.390 
gas so that all four wheels take off at
once<00:00:11.849> without<00:00:12.090> rattle<00:00:12.750> cranking<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:14.160> learned

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
once without rattle cranking we learned

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580 
once without rattle cranking we learned
that<00:00:14.580> from<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> data<00:00:15.030> log<00:00:15.330> thanks<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.440> guy

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that from the data log thanks to the guy

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.269 
that from the data log thanks to the guy
from<00:00:16.830> toca<00:00:17.359> so<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> car<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:18.869> put<00:00:19.050> down<00:00:19.279> 505

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
from toca so the car just put down 505

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
from toca so the car just put down 505
horsepower<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.910> 15<00:00:21.270> psi

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
horsepower at 15 psi

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.000 
horsepower at 15 psi
we've<00:00:22.800> unhooked<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> wastegate<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we've unhooked the wastegate the the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
we've unhooked the wastegate the the
factory<00:00:26.490> boost<00:00:26.699> controller<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:28.320> gonna

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
factory boost controller and we're gonna

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.870 
factory boost controller and we're gonna
see<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.859> runs<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.130> wastegate<00:00:29.580> spring

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
see what it runs on wastegate spring

00:00:29.880 --> 00:01:03.010 
see what it runs on wastegate spring
only

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.740 

he's<00:01:03.260> gonna<00:01:03.410> show<00:01:03.680> me<00:01:03.710> here<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> second

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.120 

see<00:01:07.900> three<00:01:08.110> horsepower<00:01:08.410> so<00:01:08.860> we<00:01:08.950> definitely

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
see three horsepower so we definitely

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.500 
see three horsepower so we definitely
picked<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.610> loose<00:01:09.790> what<00:01:10.030> boost<00:01:10.240> were<00:01:10.390> you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
picked up loose what boost were you

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
picked up loose what boost were you
seeing<00:01:11.670> 23<00:01:12.670> pounds<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.150> boost<00:01:13.300> compared<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:14.020> 15

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
seeing 23 pounds of boost compared to 15

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.370 
seeing 23 pounds of boost compared to 15
so<00:01:16.560> 598<00:01:17.560> 4<00:01:17.830> pounds<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.160> torque

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.410 

no<00:01:21.979> fuel<00:01:22.280> cut

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
no fuel cut

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
no fuel cut
really<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.260> adding<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> fuel<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.520> ten

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
really so adding all that fuel like ten

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.660 
really so adding all that fuel like ten
was<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> ten<00:01:27.690> nine<00:01:27.870> so<00:01:28.620> I<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:29.010> guests<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.580> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
was it ten nine so I like guests and it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.310 
was it ten nine so I like guests and it
was<00:01:29.760> perfect<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:32.869> yeah<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.200> pretty

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
was perfect so yeah that's pretty

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.500 
was perfect so yeah that's pretty
freakin<00:01:35.010> amazing<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.580> just<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
freakin amazing so I just got to get the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.469 
freakin amazing so I just got to get the
tune<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> there's<00:01:38.880> still<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.240> power

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
tune good and there's still more power

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.180 
tune good and there's still more power
in<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> thing<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.800> got<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
in this thing I think it's got more to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.660 
in this thing I think it's got more to
do<00:01:41.400> than<00:01:41.520> 23<00:01:41.940> psi

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.340 

Wow<00:01:49.430> I'm<00:01:50.430> happy<00:01:50.790> with<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.290 

I<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:54.070> that'll<00:01:54.310> definitely<00:01:54.400> give<00:01:54.730> me<00:01:54.760> an<00:01:54.909> 11

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
I think that'll definitely give me an 11

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.010 
I think that'll definitely give me an 11
on<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.659> bitch

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
597 foot-pounds of torque we ran it out

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.930 
597 foot-pounds of torque we ran it out
two<00:02:13.629> horsepower<00:02:14.629> was<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.110> 5500<00:02:16.900> yeah

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
two horsepower was it 5500 yeah

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.820 
two horsepower was it 5500 yeah
torque<00:02:19.940> was<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.180> 49<00:02:20.540> choice<00:02:21.110> guys<00:02:21.319> didn't<00:02:21.680> tire

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
torque was at 49 choice guys didn't tire

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.100 
torque was at 49 choice guys didn't tire
you<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.099> there's<00:02:22.430> your<00:02:22.519> maxes<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.269> there<00:02:23.510> so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you go there's your maxes right there so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.800 
you go there's your maxes right there so
the<00:02:24.260> old<00:02:24.470> power<00:02:24.769> was<00:02:25.099> at<00:02:25.310> 15<00:02:25.670> psi<00:02:25.879> with<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.420> ECU

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
the old power was at 15 psi with the ECU

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.750 
the old power was at 15 psi with the ECU
controlling<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.129> did<00:02:28.280> was<00:02:28.370> run<00:02:28.730> on

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
controlling it all we did was run on

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.240 
controlling it all we did was run on
wastegate<00:02:29.360> pressure<00:02:29.629> or<00:02:30.080> wastegate<00:02:30.530> spring

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
wastegate pressure or wastegate spring

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.479 
wastegate pressure or wastegate spring
we<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.120> connected<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.569> factory<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.170> you

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489
