00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.509 
those all tightened down and then right
here<00:03:35.590> these<00:03:36.099> will<00:03:36.340> clip<00:03:36.639> on<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.569> your<00:03:37.810> RAM

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
here these will clip on to your RAM

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.160 
here these will clip on to your RAM
mounts<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.730> then<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.540> course<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.870> have<00:03:41.019> your

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
mounts and then of course you have your

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.429 
mounts and then of course you have your
power<00:03:41.349> cable<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.280> will<00:03:42.489> plug<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.260> go

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
power cable that will plug in so I'm go

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.509 
power cable that will plug in so I'm go
ahead<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.650> splice<00:03:44.859> in<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.099> video<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.430> me

see here's my heatsink for my power

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.429 
see here's my heatsink for my power
supply<00:03:54.489> now<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.480> haven't<00:03:55.689> done<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:56.049> my<00:03:56.200> wire

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
supply now I haven't done all my wire

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.229 
supply now I haven't done all my wire
routing<00:03:56.889> yet<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:57.639> some<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:57.879> that's<00:03:57.969> going<00:03:58.180> to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
routing yet so some of that's going to

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.789 
routing yet so some of that's going to
be<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.419> way<00:03:58.599> now<00:03:58.900> one<00:03:59.230> thing<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.530> want<00:03:59.560> to

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
be in the way now one thing you want to

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.199 
be in the way now one thing you want to
keep<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.159> mind<00:04:00.400> depending<00:04:00.579> on<00:04:01.060> your

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
keep in mind depending on your

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.140 
keep in mind depending on your
motherboard<00:04:01.510> now<00:04:01.930> these<00:04:02.829> particular<00:04:03.489> slots

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
motherboard now these particular slots

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.699 
motherboard now these particular slots
the<00:04:04.480> reason<00:04:04.870> they're<00:04:04.989> colored<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.469> way<00:04:05.590> they

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the reason they're colored the way they

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.780 
the reason they're colored the way they
are<00:04:05.829> there's<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.099> certain<00:04:06.459> way<00:04:06.609> you're

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
are there's a certain way you're

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.270 
are there's a certain way you're
supposed<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> fill<00:04:07.359> them<00:04:07.709> basically<00:04:08.709> these

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
supposed to fill them basically these

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.369 
supposed to fill them basically these
two<00:04:09.340> channels<00:04:10.060> match<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.599> then<00:04:10.930> these<00:04:11.139> two

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
two channels match and then these two

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.720 
two channels match and then these two
channels<00:04:11.799> match<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.219> if<00:04:12.280> you're<00:04:12.400> only<00:04:12.519> putting

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
channels match so if you're only putting

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.000 
channels match so if you're only putting
two<00:04:13.030> sticks<00:04:13.419> in<00:04:13.719> you<00:04:14.290> want<00:04:14.469> to<00:04:14.530> make<00:04:14.650> sure<00:04:14.680> you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
two sticks in you want to make sure you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370 
two sticks in you want to make sure you
put<00:04:15.219> them<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.669> correct<00:04:16.570> location<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.229> can

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
put them in the correct location you can

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.920 
put them in the correct location you can
refer<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.680> your<00:04:17.829> motherboard<00:04:18.599> manual<00:04:19.599> on<00:04:19.870> how

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
refer to your motherboard manual on how

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.890 
refer to your motherboard manual on how
to<00:04:20.229> do<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.940> now<00:04:21.940> when<00:04:22.090> installing<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.720> you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
to do that now when installing this you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.779 
to do that now when installing this you
want<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.110> make<00:04:23.169> sure<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.590> line<00:04:23.919> that<00:04:24.130> notch<00:04:24.430> up

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
want to make sure you line that notch up

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.749 
want to make sure you line that notch up
to<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.539> corresponding<00:04:26.349> location<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.160> then

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
to the corresponding location and then

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.350 
to the corresponding location and then
once<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.150> do<00:04:28.389> you<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.259> slide<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.770> Ram<00:04:30.360> down

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
once you do you just slide that Ram down

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.749 
once you do you just slide that Ram down
in<00:04:31.599> there<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.470> you'll<00:04:33.220> feel<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.550> kind<00:04:33.669> of

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
in there and you'll feel it kind of

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.010 
in there and you'll feel it kind of
pushed<00:04:34.030> down<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.449> you'll<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.720> little<00:04:34.870> bit

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
pushed down and you'll have a little bit

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.110 
pushed down and you'll have a little bit
of<00:04:35.110> resistance<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.490> then<00:04:36.580> once<00:04:36.759> you<00:04:36.849> have<00:04:37.000> it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
of resistance and then once you have it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.420 
of resistance and then once you have it
all<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.360> way<00:04:37.449> in<00:04:37.659> that<00:04:38.409> tab<00:04:38.800> will<00:04:39.070> lock<00:04:39.250> it

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
all the way in that tab will lock it

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.330 
all the way in that tab will lock it
into<00:04:39.580> place<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.470> you'll<00:04:41.470> repeat<00:04:41.740> that

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
into place and you'll repeat that

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:53.610 
into place and you'll repeat that
for<00:04:42.759> your<00:04:42.880> second<00:04:43.330> stick<00:04:43.539> of<00:04:43.659> RAM<00:04:52.409> just<00:04:53.409> like

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
for your second stick of RAM just like

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.879 
for your second stick of RAM just like
so

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.169 

okay<00:05:03.889> as<00:05:04.009> you<00:05:04.099> can<00:05:04.129> see<00:05:04.399> here<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.759> already<00:05:04.879> have

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:05.179 
okay as you can see here I already have

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:08.379 
okay as you can see here I already have
my<00:05:05.360> RAM<00:05:05.629> install<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.460> we'll<00:05:07.580> go<00:05:07.729> ahead<00:05:07.759> and<00:05:08.240> get

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
my RAM install so we'll go ahead and get

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:16.719 
my RAM install so we'll go ahead and get
this<00:05:08.949> piece<00:05:09.949> mounted<00:05:10.550> on<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:11.499> my<00:05:12.499> RAM<00:05:15.550> now<00:05:16.550> one

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
this piece mounted on to my RAM now one

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.709 
this piece mounted on to my RAM now one
of<00:05:16.759> the<00:05:16.909> things<00:05:17.089> you're<00:05:17.179> going<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.330> want<00:05:17.509> to<00:05:17.539> do

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
of the things you're going to want to do

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.260 
of the things you're going to want to do
is<00:05:18.110> decide<00:05:18.889> which<00:05:19.219> direction<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:20.059> want<00:05:20.089> to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
is decide which direction you want to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.309 
is decide which direction you want to
orientate<00:05:20.839> the<00:05:21.399> wire<00:05:22.399> for<00:05:22.819> the<00:05:22.879> fan<00:05:23.179> now<00:05:23.749> my

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
orientate the wire for the fan now my

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.109 
orientate the wire for the fan now my
fan<00:05:24.619> controller<00:05:25.039> sits<00:05:25.369> in<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> top<00:05:25.789> portion

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:26.119 
fan controller sits in the top portion

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:29.079 
fan controller sits in the top portion
of<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.889> case<00:05:27.889> so<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.219> want<00:05:28.639> to<00:05:28.699> put<00:05:28.849> it<00:05:28.909> there

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:29.089 
of my case so I want to put it there

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:31.409 
of my case so I want to put it there
then<00:05:29.809> basically<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.379> start<00:05:30.679> with<00:05:30.889> these<00:05:31.039> feet

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
then basically you start with these feet

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.489 
then basically you start with these feet
and<00:05:32.419> you're<00:05:32.599> going<00:05:32.749> to<00:05:32.809> want<00:05:32.959> to<00:05:33.020> click<00:05:33.229> them

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:33.499 
and you're going to want to click them

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.019 
and you're going to want to click them
on<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:34.360> one<00:05:35.360> side<00:05:35.629> of<00:05:35.779> your<00:05:35.899> RAM<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.770> then<00:05:37.759> pull

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
on to one side of your RAM and then pull

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.519 
on to one side of your RAM and then pull
them<00:05:38.180> over<00:05:38.509> to<00:05:38.659> the<00:05:38.779> other<00:05:38.959> side

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
them over to the other side

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:40.570 
them over to the other side
and<00:05:39.830> you're<00:05:40.009> going<00:05:40.129> to<00:05:40.189> want<00:05:40.309> to<00:05:40.430> make<00:05:40.550> sure
