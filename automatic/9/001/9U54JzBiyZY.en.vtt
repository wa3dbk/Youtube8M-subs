00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
all right so I'll show you how bent it

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.810 
all right so I'll show you how bent it
is

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.530 

I'm<00:00:14.820> gonna<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.860> straighteners<00:00:17.450> put<00:00:18.450> my

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
I'm gonna go in straighteners put my

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.180 
I'm gonna go in straighteners put my
hand<00:00:18.720> against<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.110> rivet<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.890> know<00:00:20.040> I'm

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
hand against the rivet so I know I'm

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.810 
hand against the rivet so I know I'm
pushing<00:00:20.400> against<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> bent<00:00:21.090> heart<00:00:21.770> good

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
pushing against the bent heart good

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
pushing against the bent heart good
gently<00:00:24.770> encourage<00:00:25.770> it<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.100> a<00:00:26.130> bit

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
gently encourage it to go a bit

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.440 
gently encourage it to go a bit
straighter

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.550 

I'm<00:00:31.450> in<00:00:31.600> check<00:00:31.780> again<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.050> it's<00:00:32.290> still<00:00:32.439> very

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
I'm in check again and it's still very

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:49.209 
I'm in check again and it's still very
bent<00:00:32.830> this<00:00:33.310> one<00:00:33.490> might<00:00:33.640> break

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.810 

getting<00:00:50.219> closer

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
getting closer

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.899 
getting closer
it's<00:00:52.039> nearly<00:00:53.039> straight<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.729> little

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
it's nearly straight it's just a little

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:05.740 
it's nearly straight it's just a little
bit<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.440> set<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:59.039> behalf<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> five<00:00:59.789> mil<00:01:00.030> now

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.940 

okay<00:01:06.750> happy<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> chance

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
okay happy with that we have the chance

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
okay happy with that we have the chance
to<00:01:11.159> make<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> into<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> real<00:01:12.090> topmast<00:01:12.539> what

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to make this into a real topmast what

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.999 
to make this into a real topmast what
we're<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.049> next<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.530> drill<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
we're gonna do next is drill all the

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:46.240 
we're gonna do next is drill all the
fittings<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:15.200> till<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.289> oversized<00:01:16.710> River

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.449 

this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> hard<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:49.429> because<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:53.160> rivet

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
this is the hard one because this rivet

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.279 
this is the hard one because this rivet
is<00:01:53.580> likely<00:01:53.819> to<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.119> slightly<00:01:54.330> loose<00:01:54.599> and<00:01:55.140> it's

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
is likely to be slightly loose and it's

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.109 
is likely to be slightly loose and it's
gonna<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.739> you<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.950> spin<00:01:56.220> if<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.459> spins<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
gonna like you to spin if it spins it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.540 
gonna like you to spin if it spins it's
gonna<00:01:57.239> melt<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.440> plastic<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.220> not<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.429> end

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
gonna melt the plastic it's not the end

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.710 
gonna melt the plastic it's not the end
of<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.670> world<00:01:59.910> you'll<00:02:00.270> eventually<00:02:00.450> get

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
of the world you'll eventually get

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.279 
of the world you'll eventually get
really<00:02:00.989> out<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:02.129> it<00:02:02.729> might<00:02:02.970> be<00:02:03.149> useful<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.660> add

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
really out but it might be useful to add

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.499 
really out but it might be useful to add
a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.679> bit<00:02:04.890> more<00:02:05.209> tension<00:02:06.209> to<00:02:06.239> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
a little bit more tension to it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:21.229 
a little bit more tension to it
so<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.840> can't<00:02:07.080> spin<00:02:19.129> any<00:02:20.129> nice<00:02:20.400> melting<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> bit

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
so it can't spin any nice melting a bit

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.130 
so it can't spin any nice melting a bit
too

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.710 

tourists<00:02:24.860> attention<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.520> screwdriver<00:02:26.240> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
tourists attention with a screwdriver to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.120 
tourists attention with a screwdriver to
hold<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.200> give<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> chance<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.890> cool<00:02:27.980> down

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
hold it give it a chance to cool down

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.260 
hold it give it a chance to cool down
again<00:02:31.930> let's<00:02:32.930> come<00:02:34.120> okay

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
again let's come okay

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.250 
again let's come okay
we're<00:02:35.420> probably<00:02:35.600> not<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.930> use<00:02:35.990> that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
we're probably not going to use that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.320 
we're probably not going to use that
hole<00:02:36.500> again<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.880> end<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.090> we're<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.240> the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
hole again in the end if we're in the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.290 
hole again in the end if we're in the
most<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:40.340> gonna<00:02:40.460> go<00:02:40.670> for<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> fresh<00:02:41.090> bit

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
most we're gonna go for a fresh bit

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.180 
most we're gonna go for a fresh bit
plastic<00:02:44.290> my<00:02:45.290> punch<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.740> little<00:02:46.010> bit

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
plastic my punch is a little bit

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.610 
plastic my punch is a little bit
narrower<00:02:46.820> than<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.720> size<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> rivet<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.590> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
narrower than the size the rivet so I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.980 
narrower than the size the rivet so I
put<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.040> edge<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> little<00:02:49.250> bit<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.960> I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
put it on the edge a little bit so I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.210 
put it on the edge a little bit so I
don't<00:02:51.020> get<00:02:51.260> trapped<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.710> middle<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
don't get trapped in the middle of it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.180 
don't get trapped in the middle of it
hopefully<00:02:53.110> it's<00:02:54.110> gone<00:02:54.290> now<00:02:54.830> I've<00:02:54.890> seen<00:02:55.010> lots

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
hopefully it's gone now I've seen lots

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.610 
hopefully it's gone now I've seen lots
of<00:02:55.280> people<00:02:56.200> try<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.230> get<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.750> top<00:03:00.050> you

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
of people try to get one on the top you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:18.790 
of people try to get one on the top you
know<00:03:00.770> chiseling<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.460> basically<00:03:16.960> now<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.590> might

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
know chiseling it basically now it might

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.050 
know chiseling it basically now it might
be<00:03:18.860> easier<00:03:19.990> to<00:03:20.990> go<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> mast<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.940> to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
be easier to go to the mast just to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.330 
be easier to go to the mast just to
measure<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.410> distances<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.220> going

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
measure the distances because it's going

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.800 
measure the distances because it's going
to<00:03:25.460> put<00:03:25.790> everything<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.270> was<00:03:26.360> down<00:03:26.540> here

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
to put everything that was down here

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.010 
to put everything that was down here
right<00:03:26.960> there<00:03:27.140> now<00:03:27.320> three<00:03:27.740> caps<00:03:27.950> intact

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
right there now three caps intact

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.000 
right there now three caps intact
this<00:03:30.020> is<00:03:30.110> gonna<00:03:30.230> be<00:03:30.320> unmasked<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.830> measure

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
this is gonna be unmasked in a measure

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.590 
this is gonna be unmasked in a measure
offer<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.490> making<00:03:31.730> sure<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:31.910> our<00:03:32.150> replica

offer just making sure that our replica

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.180 
offer just making sure that our replica
master<00:03:32.960> is<00:03:33.020> exactly<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.620> same<00:03:33.830> as<00:03:34.040> the

master is exactly the same as the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.740 
master is exactly the same as the

official look it's exactly the same

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.540 
official look it's exactly the same
length<00:03:36.050> that<00:03:36.710> was<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.950> whole<00:03:37.100> sentence<00:03:37.460> on

this virgin piece of metal okay so we

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.140 
this virgin piece of metal okay so we
can<00:03:51.980> now

fit<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:59.530> we<00:04:00.530> might<00:04:00.739> stress<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.310> aluminium<00:04:01.700> the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
fit is we might stress the aluminium the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.759 
fit is we might stress the aluminium the
same<00:04:02.060> way<00:04:02.269> as<00:04:02.390> before<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:04.120> my<00:04:05.769> aluminum

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
same way as before so my aluminum

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.589 
same way as before so my aluminum
stresses<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.610> used<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.940> be<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.209> way<00:04:08.330> around

still<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.170> way<00:04:09.290> around<00:04:10.900> I'm<00:04:11.900> probably

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
still that way around I'm probably

still that way around I'm probably
definite<00:04:12.379> not<00:04:12.470> going<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> use<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.970> that

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
definite not going to use that that

definite not going to use that that
they're<00:04:15.790> defined<00:04:16.790> are<00:04:17.000> 3/16<00:04:17.720> drill<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.860> that's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
they're defined are 3/16 drill so that's

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.140 
they're defined are 3/16 drill so that's
a<00:04:33.130> perfect<00:04:34.130> drill<00:04:34.340> bit<00:04:34.520> because<00:04:34.820> we're<00:04:35.060> going

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
a perfect drill bit because we're going

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.400 
a perfect drill bit because we're going
to<00:04:35.210> go<00:04:35.300> through<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.540> lot<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.690> plastic<00:04:35.960> I've<00:04:36.260> got

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
to go through a lot of plastic I've got

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.040 
to go through a lot of plastic I've got
the<00:04:36.500> long<00:04:36.680> rivet<00:04:37.389> stainless<00:04:38.389> steel<00:04:38.600> one<00:04:38.810> so

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
the long rivet stainless steel one so

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:48.310 
the long rivet stainless steel one so
it's<00:04:39.169> a<00:04:39.350> bit<00:04:39.590> stronger<00:04:42.490> right<00:04:47.050> lots<00:04:48.050> of<00:04:48.139> piece

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
it's a bit stronger right lots of piece

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.690 
it's a bit stronger right lots of piece
on<00:04:48.530> that's<00:04:48.710> not<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.889> new<00:04:49.010> piece<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.220> plastic

that's<00:04:49.729> not<00:04:50.060> try<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.330> put<00:04:50.479> it<00:04:50.539> in<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.660> same

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
that's not try and put it in the same

that's not try and put it in the same

hole again it's just bound to be the

hole again it's just bound to be the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.200 

but<00:04:57.600> we'll<00:04:57.780> use<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.230> same<00:04:58.440> hole<00:04:58.710> before
