00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.260 

this<00:00:02.070> footage<00:00:02.310> was<00:00:02.580> actually<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.179> be

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this footage was actually going to be

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.230 
this footage was actually going to be
used<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.230> lathe<00:00:04.470> series<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.009> videos<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.520> my

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
used in my lathe series of videos in my

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.540 
used in my lathe series of videos in my
video<00:00:06.810> number<00:00:07.140> 24<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.680> G<00:00:07.890> zero<00:00:08.099> six<00:00:08.309> zero<00:00:08.370> two

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
video number 24 the G zero six zero two

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.000 
video number 24 the G zero six zero two
I<00:00:09.030> discuss<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:09.929> my<00:00:10.139> machine<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:10.769> cutting

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
I discuss how my machine was cutting

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.290 
I discuss how my machine was cutting
above<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> centerline<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.030> my<00:00:12.120> solution

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
above the centerline and my solution

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.730 
above the centerline and my solution
overcome<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.019> was<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> take<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> hundred

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
overcome that was to take a hundred

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070 
overcome that was to take a hundred
thousands<00:00:14.219> off<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> bottom<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.080> tool

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
thousands off the bottom of this tool

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
thousands off the bottom of this tool
and<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:17.039> show<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.369> clip<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> this

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and actually show you a clip of this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
and actually show you a clip of this
footage<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.600> video<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> don't

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
footage in that video but what I don't

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.679 
footage in that video but what I don't
show<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.939> actually<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.330> huge

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
show you is this was actually a huge

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.500 
show you is this was actually a huge
mistake<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.289> part<00:00:22.850> not<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.180> overall

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
mistake on my part not the overall

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.700 
mistake on my part not the overall
process<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.500> worked

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
process because it's worked

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.700 
process because it's worked
fantastically<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.779> while<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:28.019> machining

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
fantastically but while I was machining

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.070 
fantastically but while I was machining
I<00:00:29.150> neglected<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.390> pay<00:00:30.510> attention<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
I neglected to pay attention to what I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
I neglected to pay attention to what I
was<00:00:31.230> doing<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.460> nearly<00:00:33.030> ruined

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
was doing and I kind of I nearly ruined

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
was doing and I kind of I nearly ruined
the<00:00:33.660> tool<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.110> able<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> save<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.680> luckily

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the tool I was able to save it luckily

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
the tool I was able to save it luckily
but<00:00:35.610> I'll<00:00:35.820> show<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.300> happened

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
but I'll show you what happened

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
but I'll show you what happened
basically<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.890> trying<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> take<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> ten

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
basically I was trying to take a ten

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
basically I was trying to take a ten
thousand<00:00:39.149> step<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> cut<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.469> shocked

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
thousand step the cut and I was shocked

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
thousand step the cut and I was shocked
right<00:00:41.010> away<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.550> hard<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.059> steel<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.600> with

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
right away how hard the steel was with

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
right away how hard the steel was with
the<00:00:43.440> sparks<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.910> super<00:00:45.390> super<00:00:45.690> hot

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the sparks and you know super super hot

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.770 
the sparks and you know super super hot
black<00:00:46.200> chips<00:00:46.530> coming<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.600> was

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
black chips coming off of it and I was

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
black chips coming off of it and I was
impressed<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.350> face<00:00:50.250> mill<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.730> able<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
impressed that my face mill was able to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
impressed that my face mill was able to
start<00:00:51.539> working<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.410> material

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
start working right through the material

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.170 
start working right through the material
at<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> ten-thousands<00:00:53.579> depth<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> cut<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
at a ten-thousands depth of cut I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.209 
at a ten-thousands depth of cut I
started<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> become<00:00:55.320> concerned<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.010> about

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
started to become concerned what about

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
started to become concerned what about
halfway<00:00:56.430> through<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.910> noticed<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.570> really

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
halfway through I noticed I was really

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
halfway through I noticed I was really
turning<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> hand<00:00:59.039> wheel<00:00:59.129> slowly<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.760> was

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
turning the hand wheel slowly I was

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
turning the hand wheel slowly I was
barely<00:01:00.329> advancing<00:01:00.899> through<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.170> cut<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
barely advancing through this cut and I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
barely advancing through this cut and I
couldn't<00:01:02.370> figure<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
couldn't figure it out at first I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.060 
couldn't figure it out at first I
thought<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:03.899> maybe<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.379> inserts<00:01:04.799> are

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
thought well maybe my inserts are

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
thought well maybe my inserts are
already<00:01:05.430> dying<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.390> cheap

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
already dying you know they're cheap

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.679 
already dying you know they're cheap
Chinese<00:01:07.020> chars<00:01:07.860> brand<00:01:08.340> inserts<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.150> sold

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Chinese chars brand inserts or sold

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
Chinese chars brand inserts or sold
through<00:01:09.930> chars<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> thought<00:01:10.950> maybe<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
through chars so I thought maybe the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.740 
through chars so I thought maybe the
inserts<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.790> toast<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.360> why<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.600> not

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
inserts are toast and that's why I'm not

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
inserts are toast and that's why I'm not
able<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> cut<00:01:13.260> along<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
able to cut along but as what it was

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
able to cut along but as what it was
actually<00:01:15.180> happening<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.080> mill<00:01:16.290> head<00:01:16.500> was

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
actually happening was the mill head was

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
actually happening was the mill head was
allowing<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.799> head<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.130> drop<00:01:20.939> lower<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
allowing the head to drop lower and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
allowing the head to drop lower and
lower<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.170> started<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.770> 10,000

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
lower and what started out as a 10,000

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
lower and what started out as a 10,000
step<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> cut<00:01:23.909> ended<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.600> being<00:01:24.780> close<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
step to cut ended up being close to a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
step to cut ended up being close to a
hundred<00:01:25.590> thousand<00:01:25.950> step<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> cut<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> you're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
hundred thousand step to cut and you're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.160 
hundred thousand step to cut and you're
going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> able<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> gouge<00:01:27.900> here

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
going to be able to see that gouge here

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to be able to see that gouge here
in<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> second<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.180> couldn't<00:01:30.180> figure<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
in just a second I couldn't figure it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
in just a second I couldn't figure it
out<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:30.869> kept<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.439> machining

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
out and I just kept you know machining

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
out and I just kept you know machining
along<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.520> oh<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> wonder<00:01:33.030> why<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.180> isn't

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
along like oh I wonder why this isn't

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
along like oh I wonder why this isn't
working<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.049> didn't<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.560> until<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> was

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
working and didn't you know until it was

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
working and didn't you know until it was
way<00:01:35.460> too<00:01:35.490> late<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.150> finally<00:01:36.840> stopped<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
way too late I finally stopped and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
way too late I finally stopped and
realized<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.829> I've<00:01:37.950> done<00:01:38.210> there's<00:01:39.210> actually

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
realized what I've done there's actually

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.260 
realized what I've done there's actually
two<00:01:39.990> locks<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.680> each<00:01:41.040> axis<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> point<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
two locks on each axis and the point of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
two locks on each axis and the point of
it<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.659> keep<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.530> keep<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.770> axis

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it is to keep it is to keep that axis

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.440 
it is to keep it is to keep that axis
from<00:01:44.250> moving<00:01:44.520> around<00:01:44.880> while<00:01:45.270> you're

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
from moving around while you're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
from moving around while you're
machining<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.770> other<00:01:46.890> axis<00:01:47.310> since<00:01:47.820> I'm

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
machining in some other axis since I'm

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.060 
machining in some other axis since I'm
machining<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> X<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.229> Y<00:01:49.259> &amp;<00:01:49.649> Z<00:01:49.740> should

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
machining in the X the Y &amp; Z should

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
machining in the X the Y &amp; Z should
really<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.490> locked<00:01:50.759> except<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.990> know

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
really be locked except for you know

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
really be locked except for you know
unlock<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> Z<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> change<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> depth<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> cut

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
unlock the Z to change the depth of cut

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
unlock the Z to change the depth of cut
but<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.810> didn't<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.860> actually

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
but I didn't know that this was actually

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
but I didn't know that this was actually
the<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.640> thing<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> had<00:01:57.299> machined<00:01:57.689> with

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the first thing that I had machined with

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
the first thing that I had machined with
a<00:01:58.649> purpose<00:01:59.070> everything<00:01:59.399> else<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> had

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
a purpose everything else that I had

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.280 
a purpose everything else that I had
machined<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.780> point<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.259> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
machined up to this point was just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
machined up to this point was just
making<00:02:02.070> chips<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> sake<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> curiosity

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
making chips for the sake of curiosity

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
making chips for the sake of curiosity
and<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:05.030> guess<00:02:06.030> ironic<00:02:06.869> maybe<00:02:07.110> you're

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and it's I guess ironic maybe you're

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.839 
and it's I guess ironic maybe you're
just<00:02:07.530> sad<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:08.399> time<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> actually

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
just sad that the first time I actually

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.119 
just sad that the first time I actually
tried<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.539> something<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.989> screwed<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.560> by

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
tried to do something I screwed it up by

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.880 
tried to do something I screwed it up by
not<00:02:11.310> locking<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.730> z-axis<00:02:12.330> down

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
not locking that z-axis down

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.680 
not locking that z-axis down
I<00:02:12.920> would<00:02:13.220> imagine<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> bigger<00:02:14.060> heavier<00:02:14.330> mill

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
I would imagine on a bigger heavier mill

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.760 
I would imagine on a bigger heavier mill
this<00:02:14.810> probably<00:02:15.170> wouldn't<00:02:15.380> been<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> problem

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
this probably wouldn't been a problem

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.980 
this probably wouldn't been a problem
but<00:02:16.190> there<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.640> some<00:02:16.850> vibration<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.750> cut

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
but there is some vibration in this cut

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.960 
but there is some vibration in this cut
and<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:18.920> that's<00:02:19.070> probably<00:02:19.340> what<00:02:19.730> allowed

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and I think that's probably what allowed

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.170 
and I think that's probably what allowed
the<00:02:20.240> Z<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.050> lower<00:02:21.230> itself<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.920> was<00:02:22.730> able<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.030> save

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the Z to lower itself I was able to save

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.550 
the Z to lower itself I was able to save
it<00:02:23.300> though<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.450> went<00:02:23.660> back<00:02:23.840> up<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.020> taking<00:02:24.260> ten

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it though I went back up to taking ten

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.220 
it though I went back up to taking ten
thousands<00:02:25.010> passes<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.730> luckily<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.990> gouge

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
thousands passes and luckily the gouge

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.200 
thousands passes and luckily the gouge
was<00:02:27.740> no<00:02:27.920> deeper<00:02:28.250> than<00:02:28.280> hundred<00:02:28.700> thousandths

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
was no deeper than hundred thousandths

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.610 
was no deeper than hundred thousandths
and<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.480> was<00:02:29.660> my<00:02:29.810> goal<00:02:30.050> was<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.350> take<00:02:30.590> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and that was my goal was to take a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.720 
and that was my goal was to take a
hundred<00:02:30.830> thousand<00:02:31.280> soft<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.610> actually

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
hundred thousand soft so it actually

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.300 
hundred thousand soft so it actually
worked<00:02:32.090> out<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.570> end<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:32.960> I'd<00:02:33.860> also<00:02:34.100> like

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
worked out in the end but I'd also like

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.030 
worked out in the end but I'd also like
to<00:02:34.370> say<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.900> credit<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.710> face

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to say that as a credit to this face

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.140 
to say that as a credit to this face
mill<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.620> char's<00:02:40.959> 45<00:02:41.959> degree<00:02:42.430> 3<00:02:43.430> insert

mill this is a char's 45 degree 3 insert
face<00:02:44.900> mill<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.440> two<00:02:45.590> inch<00:02:45.740> wide<00:02:45.830> one<00:02:46.220> and

it handled this abuse like a champ the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.020 
it handled this abuse like a champ the

if you look at this mill on chars
website<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:57.680> listed<00:02:57.950> as<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:58.220> coming<00:02:58.520> with

website they listed as not coming with

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640 
website they listed as not coming with
inserts<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.450> actually<00:02:59.630> did<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
inserts but it actually did and the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.440 
inserts but it actually did and the
three<00:03:00.860> inserts<00:03:01.130> were<00:03:01.280> already<00:03:01.489> installed<00:03:01.790> but

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
three inserts were already installed but

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.020 
three inserts were already installed but
I<00:03:02.480> bought<00:03:02.660> an<00:03:02.810> extra<00:03:03.140> six<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.580> I've<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:04.820> plenty

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
I bought an extra six so I've got plenty

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.070 
I bought an extra six so I've got plenty
of<00:03:05.120> inserts<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.720> nice<00:03:05.870> thing<00:03:06.020> about

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
of inserts and the nice thing about

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.810 
of inserts and the nice thing about
these<00:03:06.320> square<00:03:06.620> inserts<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.430> get<00:03:07.550> four

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
these square inserts is you get four

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.030 
these square inserts is you get four
corners<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.390> cut<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:09.650> rotate<00:03:09.830> to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
corners to cut with so you can rotate to

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
out that the doing this didn't destroy

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.090 
out that the doing this didn't destroy
my<00:03:17.480> inserts<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:17.989> I've<00:03:18.590> been<00:03:18.739> using<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
my inserts but I've been using the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.190 
my inserts but I've been using the
machine<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.489> crazy<00:03:19.760> ever<00:03:20.000> since<00:03:20.090> or<00:03:21.049> the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
machine like crazy ever since or the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.630 
machine like crazy ever since or the
tool<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.410> guess<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.860> I've<00:03:22.250> still<00:03:22.489> been<00:03:22.519> getting

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
tool I guess and I've still been getting

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.820 
tool I guess and I've still been getting
great<00:03:22.880> results<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.930> face<00:03:24.170> two<00:03:24.470> full<00:03:24.650> inches

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
great results I can face two full inches

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.860 
great results I can face two full inches
of<00:03:25.100> aluminum<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.820> get<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.030> fantastically

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
of aluminum and I get a fantastically

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.990 
of aluminum and I get a fantastically
smooth<00:03:27.140> finish<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.769> haven't<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.640> done<00:03:28.760> two

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
smooth finish I haven't really done two

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.580

inches<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.390> Steel<00:03:29.660> yet<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.900> don't<00:03:30.080> have<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> chunk

I<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.720> guess<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.049> just<00:03:33.170> haven't<00:03:33.320> thought

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
I do I guess I just haven't thought

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.930 
I do I guess I just haven't thought
about<00:03:33.560> doing<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.130> should<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.730> maybe

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
about doing it I should do that maybe

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.120 
about doing it I should do that maybe
I'll<00:03:35.060> make<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.269> video<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.810> guys<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:37.010> any

the<00:03:44.000> one<00:03:44.150> regret<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.600> do<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.959> is<00:03:45.140> that

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
the one regret that I do have is that

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.600 
the one regret that I do have is that
it's<00:03:45.410> an<00:03:45.500> r8<00:03:47.380> Arbor<00:03:48.380> for<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.950> RH<00:03:49.220> spindle

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
it's an r8 Arbor for the RH spindle

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.729 
it's an r8 Arbor for the RH spindle
which<00:03:49.790> obviously<00:03:50.299> works<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:51.200> down<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.709> road

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
which obviously works but down the road

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.470 
which obviously works but down the road
I<00:03:51.980> plan<00:03:52.190> on<00:03:52.220> going<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.820> tormach<00:03:53.180> style

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
I plan on going with the tormach style

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.820 
I plan on going with the tormach style
of<00:03:53.630> tooling<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.200> kind<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.410> wish<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.590> I'd

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
of tooling and I kind of wish that I'd

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.280 
of tooling and I kind of wish that I'd
bought<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.100> face<00:03:55.549> mill<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.750> didn't<00:03:57.080> have<00:03:57.200> an

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
bought a face mill that didn't have an

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.470 
bought a face mill that didn't have an
arbor<00:03:57.590> or<00:03:57.799> at<00:03:58.400> least<00:03:58.549> had<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> removable<00:03:59.120> one<00:03:59.330> so

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
arbor or at least had a removable one so

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.390 
arbor or at least had a removable one so
I<00:03:59.540> could<00:03:59.600> swap<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.110> out<00:04:00.260> or<00:04:00.530> make<00:04:00.739> one<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.370> I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
I could swap it out or make one so I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.280 
I could swap it out or make one so I
could<00:04:01.700> eventually<00:04:01.940> use<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.600> face<00:04:02.810> mill<00:04:03.080> and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
could eventually use this face mill and

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.140 
could eventually use this face mill and
the<00:04:03.350> tormach<00:04:03.650> style<00:04:03.950> tooling<00:04:04.310> but<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.700> don't

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the tormach style tooling but I don't

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
the tormach style tooling but I don't
think<00:04:05.239> that's<00:04:05.420> ever<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.750> happen<00:04:05.870> I

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
think that's ever going to happen I

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.750 
think that's ever going to happen I
guess<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.620> could<00:04:06.769> try<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.040> chuck<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.519> in<00:04:07.640> my

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
guess I could try to chuck it up in my

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.650 
guess I could try to chuck it up in my
lathe<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.239> machine<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.989> three-quarter<00:04:09.650> inch

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
lathe and machine a three-quarter inch

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.000 
lathe and machine a three-quarter inch
Arbor<00:04:11.660> but<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:12.019> don't<00:04:12.440> think<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.620> have<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.829> balls

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
Arbor but I don't think I have the balls

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.710 
Arbor but I don't think I have the balls
for<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.579> guess<00:04:13.940> maybe<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.239> could<00:04:14.420> outsource

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
for that I guess maybe I could outsource

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.420 
for that I guess maybe I could outsource
it<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.079> don't<00:04:15.260> know<00:04:15.320> it<00:04:15.709> seems<00:04:16.010> awfully<00:04:16.130> risky

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
it I don't know it seems awfully risky

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.759 
it I don't know it seems awfully risky
to<00:04:16.669> me<00:04:17.049> anyway<00:04:18.049> that's<00:04:18.350> pretty<00:04:18.470> much
