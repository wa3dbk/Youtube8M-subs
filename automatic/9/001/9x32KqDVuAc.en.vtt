a bit of brightness poking through 14
degrees<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:36.809> remember<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
degrees but remember there's that really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
English Channel so perhaps it doesn't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
English Channel so perhaps it doesn't
feel<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.680> 14<00:00:44.100> degrees<00:00:44.370> even<00:00:44.760> though<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.480> are
