00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
ridiculous performances maybe a little

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.549 
ridiculous performances maybe a little
bit<00:00:13.549> overlooked<00:00:13.999> was<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:14.659> new<00:00:14.839> era<00:00:15.110> of<00:00:15.289> tight

fundamental<00:01:28.280> defense<00:01:28.940> that's<00:01:29.150> really

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
fundamental defense that's really

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.360 
fundamental defense that's really
important<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:29.990> what<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.260> do<00:01:30.470> they<00:01:30.860> wrap<00:01:31.130> up

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
important to what we do they wrap up

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.860 
important to what we do they wrap up
yeah<00:01:31.610> they<00:01:31.760> makes<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> big<00:01:32.270> hits<00:01:32.450> along<00:01:32.660> the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
yeah they makes the big hits along the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.720 
yeah they makes the big hits along the
way<00:01:32.990> but<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.830> fact<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.160> they<00:01:34.310> don't<00:01:34.580> let

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
way but the fact that they don't let

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.220 
way but the fact that they don't let
those<00:01:34.880> yards<00:01:35.180> after<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.600> catch<00:01:35.690> that's<00:01:36.050> what

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
those yards after the catch that's what

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.680 
those yards after the catch that's what
the<00:01:36.320> saints<00:01:36.560> are<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:36.850> dangerous<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
the saints are so dangerous on the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.180 
the saints are so dangerous on the
screen<00:01:39.050> game<00:01:39.230> was<00:01:39.380> wiped<00:01:39.710> out<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.130> game

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
screen game was wiped out in that game

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.040 
screen game was wiped out in that game
yeah<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.760> early<00:01:41.060> one<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.300> Pierre<00:01:41.510> Thomas<00:01:41.750> were

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
yeah the early one to Pierre Thomas were

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.450 
yeah the early one to Pierre Thomas were
they<00:01:42.170> not<00:01:42.440> only<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.740> Thomas<00:01:42.980> get<00:01:43.130> hurt<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:43.400> he

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
they not only the Thomas get hurt but he

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.620 
they not only the Thomas get hurt but he
fumbles<00:01:43.850> near<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> goal<00:01:44.240> line<00:01:44.270> really

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
fumbles near the goal line really

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.760 
fumbles near the goal line really
changed<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> whole<00:01:45.080> complexion<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.650> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
changed the whole complexion of that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830 
changed the whole complexion of that
game<00:01:45.950> early<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.280> TJ<00:01:47.060> Yates<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.390> think<00:01:47.570> filled<00:01:47.750> in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
game early on TJ Yates I think filled in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.750 
game early on TJ Yates I think filled in
pretty<00:01:48.020> admirable<00:01:48.250> admirably<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.520> year<00:01:49.670> for

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
pretty admirable admirably this year for

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.370 
pretty admirable admirably this year for
the<00:01:49.820> Texans<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.720> know<00:01:50.810> got<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> playoffs

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
the Texans you know got to the playoffs

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.500 
the Texans you know got to the playoffs
they<00:01:51.620> got<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> win<00:01:52.070> but<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.640> he<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.820> long<00:01:53.270> term

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
they got a win but is he a long term

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.600 
they got a win but is he a long term
solution<00:01:53.540> for<00:01:54.200> them<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.350> mean<00:01:54.560> could<00:01:55.280> he<00:01:55.310> fill

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
solution for them I mean could he fill

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.040 
solution for them I mean could he fill
in<00:01:55.760> for<00:01:55.940> mass<00:01:56.060> job<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.450> future<00:01:56.720> yeah<00:01:56.990> I

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
in for mass job in the future yeah I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.530 
in for mass job in the future yeah I
think<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.620> future<00:01:57.650> but<00:01:58.130> we<00:01:58.250> may<00:01:58.430> go<00:01:58.610> 2012

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
think in the future but we may go 2012

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.940 
think in the future but we may go 2012
without<00:01:59.780> really<00:02:00.020> seeing<00:02:00.350> him<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.680> know<00:02:00.800> Matt

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
without really seeing him you know Matt

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.860 
without really seeing him you know Matt
shop<00:02:01.220> should<00:02:01.520> regain<00:02:02.210> his<00:02:02.450> starting<00:02:02.840> spot

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
shop should regain his starting spot

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600 
shop should regain his starting spot
next<00:02:03.350> year<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.620> all<00:02:03.800> indications<00:02:04.220> are<00:02:04.550> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
next year that all indications are that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.430 
next year that all indications are that
he<00:02:04.850> will<00:02:05.030> get<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.240> chance<00:02:05.420> Yates<00:02:06.230> isn't

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
he will get that chance Yates isn't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.780 
he will get that chance Yates isn't
supposed<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.010> some<00:02:07.400> kind<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.580> battle

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
supposed to be in some kind of battle

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.700 
supposed to be in some kind of battle
with<00:02:08.090> him<00:02:08.239> by<00:02:08.390> any

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
with him by any

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.380 
with him by any
I<00:02:08.800> don't<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.370> they're<00:02:09.610> married<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.150> Shaab

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
I don't think they're married to Shaab

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.540 
I don't think they're married to Shaab
long-term<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:11.320> Yates<00:02:11.590> may<00:02:11.830> get<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> chance<00:02:12.130> you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
long-term so Yates may get a chance you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.280 
long-term so Yates may get a chance you
just<00:02:12.700> got<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:13.030> patient<00:02:13.240> gotta<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.050> kind<00:02:14.230> of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
just got to be patient gotta be kind of

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.870 
just got to be patient gotta be kind of
a<00:02:14.320> weird<00:02:14.530> thing<00:02:14.800> he<00:02:14.980> wasn't<00:02:15.160> expected<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.700> play

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880
