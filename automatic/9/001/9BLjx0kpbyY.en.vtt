00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
threes and at really kind of opened my

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
threes and at really kind of opened my
eyes<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.659> gonna<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.200> special

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
eyes up to that this is gonna be special

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
eyes up to that this is gonna be special
but<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.010> wasn't<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.340> Taylor<00:01:11.790> himself<00:01:11.909> who

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
but it wasn't just Taylor himself who

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.120 
but it wasn't just Taylor himself who
saw<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.869> history<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.380> perhaps<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
saw that history was perhaps in the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.490 
saw that history was perhaps in the
making<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.909> team<00:01:15.299> rallied<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:15.930> him<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
making his team rallied around him to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.820 
making his team rallied around him to
see<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.580> possible<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.479> half<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
see what was possible a half time when I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490
