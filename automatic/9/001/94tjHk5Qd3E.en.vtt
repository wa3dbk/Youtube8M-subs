teachers are really good middle school
did<00:04:22.140> good<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.280> high<00:04:23.460> school<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
did good and then in high school the

did good and then in high school the
medium<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.960> then<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.380> college<00:04:25.620> j-just

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
medium and then in college j-just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.770 
medium and then in college j-just
we<00:04:26.690> can<00:04:26.930> suck<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:28.730> just<00:04:28.760> gets<00:04:29.210> walls<00:04:29.510> from

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
we can suck so it just gets walls from

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.600 
we can suck so it just gets walls from
hill<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:31.930> for<00:04:32.930> math<00:04:33.140> I'm<00:04:33.440> taking<00:04:33.770> geometry<00:04:34.070> on

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
hill and for math I'm taking geometry on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.470 
hill and for math I'm taking geometry on
wheels<00:04:34.910> i<00:04:35.240> am<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:36.080> i'm<00:04:36.380> one<00:04:36.800> you'll<00:04:37.100> be<00:04:37.480> one

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
wheels i am a i'm one you'll be one

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.640 
wheels i am a i'm one you'll be one
yield<00:04:38.780> advance<00:04:39.740> full<00:04:40.520> math<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.500> max<00:04:42.500> you

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
yield advance full math and the max you

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.830 
yield advance full math and the max you
can<00:04:42.770> do<00:04:42.920> is<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.250> Yule<00:04:43.460> savants<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.360> kids<00:04:44.630> could

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
can do is to Yule savants so kids could

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.800 
can do is to Yule savants so kids could
be<00:04:44.990> taking<00:04:45.320> algebra<00:04:45.590> two<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:46.180> yeah<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.420> that's

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
be taking algebra two and yeah so that's

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.330 
be taking algebra two and yeah so that's
really<00:04:47.930> high<00:04:48.350> school<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.360> change<00:04:50.630> but<00:04:50.990> I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
really high school it's a change but I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.510 
really high school it's a change but I
think<00:04:52.340> we'll<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.460> get<00:04:52.760> battle<00:04:53.090> oval<00:04:53.660> time<00:04:53.870> so

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
think we'll just get battle oval time so

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.500 
think we'll just get battle oval time so
then<00:04:55.520> that's<00:04:55.760> all<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.000> want<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.330> talk<00:04:56.480> about
