00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030 
that we have to mention here first of
all<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> icon<00:01:31.009> make<00:01:32.009> sure

all if you don't have the icon make sure

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.569 
all if you don't have the icon make sure
that<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.540> computer<00:01:33.540> has<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> windows

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that your computer has the windows

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.210 
that your computer has the windows
updates<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.869> every<00:01:37.380> month<00:01:37.799> you've<00:01:38.009> been

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
updates and that every month you've been

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.749 
updates and that every month you've been
receiving<00:01:38.579> updates<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:40.829> very<00:01:40.950> important

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
receiving updates that's very important

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.530 
receiving updates that's very important
because<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:43.229> icon<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> updates

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
because this icon is one of the updates

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.770 
because this icon is one of the updates
and<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> don't<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> latest

and so if you don't have the latest

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.310 
and so if you don't have the latest
updates<00:01:49.259> maybe<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.399> don't<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.320> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
updates maybe you just don't have that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.370 
updates maybe you just don't have that
little<00:01:53.280> piece<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> software<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.420> wants<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little piece of software that wants you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.420 
little piece of software that wants you
to<00:01:55.530> reserve<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:55.860> copy<00:01:57.829> make<00:01:58.829> sure<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.219> not

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
to reserve your copy make sure it's not

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
to reserve your copy make sure it's not
hidden<00:01:59.700> behind<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.930> little<00:02:01.170> arrow<00:02:01.439> here

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
hidden behind that little arrow here

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.340 
hidden behind that little arrow here
that<00:02:02.250> shows<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.850> icons<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:04.020> another

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that shows it in icons that's another

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830 
that shows it in icons that's another
reason<00:02:04.799> some<00:02:05.430> people<00:02:05.460> might<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.570> seen

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
reason some people might not have seen

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
reason some people might not have seen
it<00:02:07.099> mostly<00:02:08.099> because<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.550> hidden<00:02:08.789> behind

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it mostly because it's hidden behind

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.920 
it mostly because it's hidden behind
there<00:02:10.220> but<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:12.030> if

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
there but what if

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.459 
good for upgrade to Windows 10 and
Microsoft<00:02:35.840> did<00:02:36.840> say<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.719> icon<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
not on your taskbar it might be because
you<00:02:48.470> your<00:02:49.470> computer<00:02:49.829> is<00:02:49.980> not<00:02:51.349> ready<00:02:52.349> for

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you your computer is not ready for

you your computer is not ready for
Windows<00:02:52.919> 10<00:02:54.079> maybe<00:02:55.079> because<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> drivers<00:02:56.489> or

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
Windows 10 maybe because of drivers or

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.379 
Windows 10 maybe because of drivers or
specific<00:02:58.290> software<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:59.629> any<00:03:00.629> other<00:03:01.219> problem

specific software or any other problem

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.080 
specific software or any other problem
but<00:03:03.469> Microsoft<00:03:04.469> did<00:03:04.620> say<00:03:04.889> that<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.519> upgrade

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
but Microsoft did say that the upgrade

icon does not appear on some computers

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.709 
icon does not appear on some computers
because<00:03:08.879> it<00:03:09.060> does<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.389> meet<00:03:09.689> the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
because it does not meet the

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.179 
because it does not meet the
requirements<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.879> now<00:03:12.469> but<00:03:13.469> Microsoft<00:03:14.040> did

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
requirements for now but Microsoft did

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
microsoft says that on some pcs they did

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.589 
microsoft says that on some pcs they did
not<00:04:06.900> put<00:04:07.169> it<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:08.819> reason<00:04:08.970> why<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.329> because

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
not put it and the reason why is because

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.009 
not put it and the reason why is because
of<00:04:10.229> missing<00:04:10.829> drivers<00:04:11.280> or<00:04:11.489> some<00:04:12.090> requirement

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
of missing drivers or some requirement

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
they don't want you to upgrade and have

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.949 
they don't want you to upgrade and have
problems<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.709> they<00:04:16.739> did<00:04:17.639> not<00:04:17.880> put<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.209> icon<00:04:18.780> on

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
problems so they did not put the icon on

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.259 
problems so they did not put the icon on
some<00:04:19.440> computers<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.370> they<00:04:20.579> know<00:04:20.759> might<00:04:21.029> have

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
some computers that they know might have

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.360 
some computers that they know might have
problems<00:04:21.840> once<00:04:22.109> they<00:04:22.349> upgrade<00:04:22.469> to<00:04:22.770> Windows<00:04:23.070> 10

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
problems once they upgrade to Windows 10

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.330 
problems once they upgrade to Windows 10
so<00:04:24.060> basically<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:25.440> says<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.800> everybody<00:04:26.130> that

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
so basically it says that everybody that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.830 
so basically it says that everybody that
has<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
has the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.290 
has the
logo<00:04:27.080> should<00:04:27.860> normally<00:04:28.280> upgrade<00:04:28.730> very<00:04:29.030> well

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
logo should normally upgrade very well

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.390 
logo should normally upgrade very well
to<00:04:29.480> Windows<00:04:29.780> 10<00:04:30.050> these<00:04:30.650> are<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.980> people<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
to Windows 10 these are the people that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.930 
to Windows 10 these are the people that
have<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:32.030> little<00:04:32.330> icon<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.770> taskbar<00:04:34.130> so

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
have that little icon in the taskbar so

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.909 
have that little icon in the taskbar so
that's<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.389> state<00:04:35.720> for<00:04:36.199> now<00:04:36.380> of<00:04:36.650> what's

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
that's the state for now of what's

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.330 
that's the state for now of what's
happening<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.550> hopefully<00:04:39.100> we'll<00:04:40.100> have<00:04:40.310> a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
happening and hopefully we'll have a

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.760 
happening and hopefully we'll have a
workaround<00:04:40.760> or<00:04:41.090> maybe<00:04:41.500> after<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> release

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
workaround or maybe after the release

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.040 
workaround or maybe after the release
once<00:04:43.190> we<00:04:43.370> know<00:04:43.520> very<00:04:43.729> clearly<00:04:44.240> how<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.780> can

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
once we know very clearly how you can

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.810 
once we know very clearly how you can
upgrade<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.590> different<00:04:46.040> ways<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.370> upgrading

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
upgrade the different ways of upgrading

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.240 
upgrade the different ways of upgrading
to<00:04:46.850> Windows<00:04:47.180> 10<00:04:47.419> maybe<00:04:47.840> you'll<00:04:48.050> have

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
to Windows 10 maybe you'll have
