so<00:00:33.780> basically<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.800> made<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.160> new<00:00:35.309> maps<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
so basically they made two new maps the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.979 
so basically they made two new maps the
first<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.690> seeing<00:00:36.899> right

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first one is what you're seeing right

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.130 
first one is what you're seeing right
now<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.530> called<00:00:37.680> seizure<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.329> it's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now it's called seizure I think and it's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
now it's called seizure I think and it's
a<00:00:40.320> sniper<00:00:40.590> only<00:00:40.890> map<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a sniper only map I really like it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.520 
a sniper only map I really like it
actually<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.390> reminds<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> prison<00:00:43.260> layout

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
actually it reminds me the prison layout

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.920 
actually it reminds me the prison layout
because<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> far<00:00:44.219> distance<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.930> it's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
because of the far distance and it's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
because of the far distance and it's
just<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:46.590> cool<00:00:46.860> oh<00:00:47.070> no<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.730> better<00:00:47.879> than

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
just pretty cool oh no it's better than

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029

a nice feeling to the map that
atmosphere<00:05:47.890> is<00:05:47.980> awesome<00:05:48.100> like<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.700> like<00:05:48.880> my

stronghold<00:05:52.390> even<00:05:52.840> though<00:05:52.900> it's<00:05:53.020> not

nighttime<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.740> think<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.310> map<00:05:54.430> would<00:05:54.550> be

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
nighttime I think that map would be

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.850 
nighttime I think that map would be
awesome<00:05:55.000> if<00:05:55.120> they<00:05:55.240> had<00:05:55.390> like<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.860> darker

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
awesome if they had like a darker

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.100 
awesome if they had like a darker
version<00:05:56.890> of<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.370> map<00:05:57.550> or<00:05:57.760> something<00:05:58.110> maybe

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
version of the map or something maybe

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.780 
version of the map or something maybe
it's<00:05:59.290> just<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.530> nostalogie<00:05:59.890> as<00:06:00.130> from<00:06:00.610> back<00:06:00.760> when

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
it's just a nostalogie as from back when

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.160 
it's just a nostalogie as from back when
I<00:06:00.970> used<00:06:01.030> to<00:06:01.450> play<00:06:01.570> in<00:06:01.840> the<00:06:02.440> beginning<00:06:03.010> years<00:06:04.170> a

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
I used to play in the beginning years a

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.440 
I used to play in the beginning years a
favorite<00:06:05.920> weapon<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.520> would<00:06:07.120> have<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.420> say

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.910 
that's a really hard question answer but
