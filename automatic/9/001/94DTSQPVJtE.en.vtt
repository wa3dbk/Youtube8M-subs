00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello everyone today came to me like that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.550
 interesting legs over call still cold 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.550
 steel warcraft tantu 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.380
 what is so interesting in principle you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.380
 You can ask him in an ordinary knife 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 cold steel narrow you let in 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.759
 accordingly, the handle design is well all 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.700
 it seems that there is nothing more interesting than that 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.980
 interesting two moments 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 I like and I want to draw your 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 attention accordingly due to which i 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 I decided to shoot this video moment number 1 well 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.020
 first got the legs of the box such here 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 you can go to him , too, as if all 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:08.700
 more or less standard 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 the very first moment and the most important thing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 I think it is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:21.540
 steel blades steel here think 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.259
 have there been m3 do many models from call 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.850
 Steve saw where what more or less 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.829
 serious store here is this knife on it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.540
 worth sleeping thriving wreaths 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.850
 in the second moment accordingly too 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.460
 continuation of this blade cover as 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 stated in principle there is no point not to believe 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.950
 the manufacturer is dlc is 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 pretty well made through it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:02.280
 look through satin here accordingly 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.740
 processing lines here by this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.610
 advertisements advertisements on forks channel 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.820
 this knife is small there 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.590
 the article there says that a group of people 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.710
 tested this knife in the forests of pennsylvania 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:27.010
 three months and with a blade of coating 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:30.790
 nothing happened now let's 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.010
 usually here is a ticker row try to remove 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.020
 dimensions 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.750
 what is he like this knife 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:44.680
 to its length we get almost 32 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 a centimeter without a couple of millimeters length 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 blade 18 and a half respectively 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.180
 the cutting edge of diabetes seventeen s 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:04.540
 half feels the sensations 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.420
 handle let's say so but for chopping me 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.900
 seems to fit very pretty pretty 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.940
 yet convenient to cut simulator reduction 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.470
 understandable effects on him horse here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:29.650
 Well, in principle, I think that it should 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:32.500
 be on such knives where before removing 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.049
 video tried how skill cuts when 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.769
 this piece of paper is normal the most important thing 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.890
 this place, he also breaks and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.680
 so pretty decent there are flaws 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.799
 small will be seen 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.600
 the hilt of the metal buys for it 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.060
 would 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.200
 the lines of metals and handles are slightly not 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.269
 coincides as stated experience 10 on the sleeve 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.290
 you're so pretty he chains honestly 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.500
 saying I did not expect it to be 10 on what 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.200
 still synthetic 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.230
 TVel on the site this set it something 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.079
 about 300 dollars but this 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.530
 of Drogan not say so on the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:31.230
 Foxy it costs about 180 dollars 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:37.280
 I donâ€™t know this knife 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.280

 An interesting leg will be able to your your friend 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.430
 and squeezed by the review I really was 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.410
 very surprised when I found out 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.160
 what course of the body decided to apply 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.660
 steel blades for them it is perfect 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.060
 atypically just competently tried 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.910
 to make 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.450
 the devil will be visible thickness on the butt 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:16.400

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.400
 thinner more why two times 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.110
 balance balance will be skillfully 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.690
 here 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.640
 although quite tourists such a knife is not 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.580
 looked how much his weight on 2 4 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:50.350
 a millimeter in the butt 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:54.590
