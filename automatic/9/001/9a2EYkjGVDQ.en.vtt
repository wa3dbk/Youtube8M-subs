00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.509
 celio nice morning how morning there 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 today you make us a special via 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 youtube videos of success in video mode 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.470
 loose how to miss his train 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.270
 that's it we'll try to find such 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 that keyyo good reasons for that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.260
 maybe the slip turned to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.039
 which I think first the first one 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.890
 might be reasons 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.810
 say of personal order yes before 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.980
 to get to the bus stop we are we are 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.370
 at home 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.320
 the coffee is not hot because the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.489
 coffee machine did not work the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.530
 morning or again the roll of paper 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.170
 toilet gets to the end it would do well 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.140
 sure you have to go down in disaster 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 in the shed to look for the roll 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.870
 of paper finally a whole bunch of reasons 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.650
 of that kind that make us one to the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 fluff in the morning the minutes go by and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.290
 so that's the personal reasons 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.360
 reasons we see is order 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.030
 personal the second I think it's 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.950
 the because of the goal but that tells us 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.980
 a little bit more about the butte itself 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.560
 muscle that actually does not go to 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.560
 exactly when he should spend 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.330
 so we're waiting we're on the dock 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 finally on the platform we are on the sidewalk 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.440
 and yes, yes, it does not come 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 happens that the bus stop itself is 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.240
 deleted and also happens that the judgment 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 bus is printed then it's those of 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.270
 matter inadvertently 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.979
 we are not warned in one go 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.640
 realize that we are all alone 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.710
 the bus stop 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.480
 there is a problem one is not wary and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.030
 do not be afraid 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.400
 unfortunately even allard and he was 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.350
 moved the bus went somewhere else and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.630
 there we find ourselves a little like one like 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.740
 a tale to produce why so he 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.120
 remains the third point in this case 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.880
 it's like running now 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.520
 you have to run the race to who is 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.590
 running is an art because 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.210
 that we look at his watch 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.840
 we are on the street are well that shows on 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.869
 realize that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.160
 we have twelve minutes ahead of us 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.190
 have finally done 16 and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.110
 joy that it's still playable but you have to 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.240
 a tension 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.780
 so you have to deal with the worries of gaza 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.010
 must manage them 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.660
 we leave we leave quiet and then because 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.810
 that there is a misdemeanor then in the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.630
 coast we are we are quiet we are in 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.300
 advance on a good step and then then he 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.890
 there is a false full so on the false flat 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.240
 have to take a little speed yeah a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.610
 little speed and then gradually 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.020
 more and more to catch up a little bit the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.490
 lost time because we must not forget 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.990
 that we won we have four minutes 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.319
 in the view at the start and at the end it is 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.879
 or 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.280
 go there I have a slight descent and there 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.799
 you have to give everything until 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.810
 we realize that finally the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.459
 train which affiliates and ideas not 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.600
 still at the dock and then we relax 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.540
 for the law we because 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.910
 especially do not get sweaty on the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.980
 little bayonne 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.900
 the fourth point is at hull busm summer 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.120
 trapped in the bus and who can explain 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.610
 a little yes so my case like this there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.260
 to have multiple 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.290
 I want her to 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.090
 we can think you spoke pata 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.610
 for example buses on short buses 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.900
 usual stops morand at the time 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.239
 everything takes the bus because there is 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.420
 so many people it's a mission but 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.569
 this morning there as expected have planned 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.390
 to put to move and so it's in a 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.470
 bus that contains his people he has to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.390
 go back 150 but here we are 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.950
 we are like nags in the bus 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.239
 the bus takes a different time crazy 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.450
 stops because you have to leave 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.109
 get off people we do not get out either 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 because we are going to buy it and suddenly 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.280
 so here it is actually 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.500
 okay so the bus cause or who 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.599
 when they arrive at the station but a little 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.599
 of time to open the doors and the cold 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.640
 do not go past ok you can us 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.259
 talk about point 5 and the trap of time 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.359
 who passed 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.579
 how do I think you have a small 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.620
 schivardi these sages when the trap of 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.130
 time passing or so that can it can 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.580
 to be effectively 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.280
 a case where 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.380
 at 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.850
 we simply turn goal from where 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.129
 everywhere he sees a corner pickup chew 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.659
 and then finally the 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.689
 the train him he arrives he arrives at dock 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.689
 so where you have to rock to get 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.129
 on the dock and 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.720
 there are already ya cases where 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.940
 actually the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.520
 the train at the dock we know it's there we 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.680
 hear it you hear the ring of the train 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.000
 and there are still fifty people who 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.160
 arrive on the platform at this time without 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.480
 to make hell hell the doors get 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.830
 close but there are still 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.450
 there are three who manage to climb in 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.060
 disaster and 47 who remain on the 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.340
 quay a punishment because the point 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.450
 number 6 the train that does not pass you 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.960
 can we give some reasons 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.390
 invoked by this humble house 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.600
 rail transport of course then 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.270
 you have reasons there are also 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.420
 the multiples it can be the catenary 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.070
 in broken belt say that he broke 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.010
 it's not that they're breaking away from 4th 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.510
 and there is also the strike of a party 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.510
 staff at a radius there 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.760
 the routing of the father will be the problem 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.390
 of routing his words without a 3rd 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.260
 staff routing 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.260
 weathering 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.600
 you are good game 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.290
 you are the world for sncf 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.290
 atalanta 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.639
 many times better 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.560
 I like this 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.520
 he does not get tired of it and he ends us 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.199
 okay but that's it 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.090
 they are hasty on the subject are they 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.699
 are scraped 7 points and she was called 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.000
 trapped in the car tribute to sir 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.560
 franck yes then actually good one 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.449
 waiting for the bus for months of 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.530
 years lived we realized that 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.210
 it was just the world maybe not the 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.680
 ideal way so at one point we have 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.289
 a little fed up and we take his car to 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.810
 to get to the luxury train when 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.599
 luxury will come yeah it's not very 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.920
 grenelle of the environment all that he 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.920
 must also 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.150
 10 and 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.740
 efficiency so but it also happens 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.720
 that this is not always the way the 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.520
 more effective because had a red light 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.449
 an accident 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.389
 we now wish we will 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.830
 find when we look at his car at 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.360
 parking there is no place for 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.509
 park 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.409
 we turn and then the bus the train him there 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.939
 arrives at dock yeah 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:48.999
 we see him arrive we park in 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:48.999
 disaster and the fucking name
