00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.880
 now in this video are more than anything 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.360
 in fact for the people that I was 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.519
 asking is like a little guide that is 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.219
 make a macro to choose what is the 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.590
 place over w 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.810
 this macro also serves with catarina and 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.150
 with jacques that also have a jump 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.359
 to get to the bar and have to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.359
 modify the following is more than anything 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.000
 a notebook is amending 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.029
 super simple is not an external program 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 or anything so up this is not 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.400
 illegal 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.550
 For my part I do not recommend it so much 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.260
 because I've done one loses skill with 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.390
 the champions 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.160
 you have to get used to having them 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.140
 marks equal in the rooms and all that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.879
 but for people who are new and you're 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.340
 playing well and wants this to come out 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 macro is equal to doing a lot 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.460
 I'm going to tell you that this takes him out of Reid 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.980
 I can not ask you the subject because 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 because I lost the link of the subject 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 only the notepad of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 notes in a folder and there I had it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 until I remembered that I could 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 show it to you so now 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 let's see how we can modify 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.100
 this note blog and where is it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100
 the notebook that or modify 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.380
 well then now let's go to 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.060
 modify what is the notebook in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.060
 the block of notes that you are going to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.460
 have is going to be this this I'm going to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.399
 leave to download it and have it 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.979
 in your hands the file that we have to 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.600
 modify is on the local disk we go 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.260
 to the folder riot games league of 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.000
 legends config 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.680
 in pos and here is 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.650
 this this this is currently as 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.870
 I have the configurations of my 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 keys 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.260
 I do not have it with the macro one because 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.870
 I did not get used to that, I used to 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.220
 have them marks and all of that then what 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.140
 first thing we have to do is copy 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.870
 this in case you do not have any left 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.170
 liking 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.150
 we close them and I put it to me lean 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.590
 and I have as another notebook what 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 I have like my macro then we paste it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.470
 here for how to enclose in quotes 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.689
 in our blog denotes our our 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.209
 button configurations already having 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.000
 saved this we have is and what 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.750
 we have to do is copy this we 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.750
 let's input 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.560
 we delete and paste the grohl theme and something 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.930
 that I forget here are this supposed 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.230
 that the guard should be in the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.990
 6 in number 6 understand me and the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.330
 athlete that we have to squeeze 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.850
 slate so that the double guard is applied 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 bone guard twice higher than me 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.090
 understand or if we want to put the j me 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.810
 understand here we have to put jota 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.040
 also and it depends on what on you and what 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.750
 the guard is going to put it on if you 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.730
 they put it on 2 we put the whole guard 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.890
 then we want to press twice 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.290
 guard and apply the jump more or 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.060
 be the highest guard there you what 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.510
 they have to go modifying 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.900
 what suited me was late beats and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.459
 put the guard in 6 then 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.459
 tight twice beats and he put on the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.739
 save more the more the jump so you can 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.200
 force in all the vote this 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.790
 it works normally the jump equal you 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.100
 will work normal because the double 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.470
 one more and that's super basic 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.810
 that would be all the video is super basic 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.360
 and that thanks for the I like to put 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.240
 subscribe flesh and blood to all 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.660
 the abitab army all that follows that would say 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.660
 I
