00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.070
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.260
 I bring a very good game called naruto 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.130
 shippuden kizuna drive so I hope 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.130
 be of your liking 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.120
 we will play this game through 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.250
 of the psc emulator so if they do not have 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.110
 this emulator I will leave you on my page 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.059
 web the apk of the ghost version so that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.590
 download it as well as they 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.730
 I will leave the iso file so that 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.730
 Download this game 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.869
 the hand emulator only requires a 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.000
 version of android 2.2 or higher for 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.970
 can work and has a weight of 17 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 megas the file of the game I will leave them 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.840
 already in iso format and has a weight of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.670
 1,000 megabytes approximately so already 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.829
 have the emulator installed and the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.259
 game in iso format downloaded and in the 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.210
 sd load your device the only thing that 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.009
 we have to do is open the emulator and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.200
 in the game tab of the emulator we 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.850
 an explorer-like interface will appear 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.860
 of files so already being there 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.750
 we look for the game in the folder that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.270
 we have and we just select it 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.869
 and will automatically start running 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.869
 the game 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.350
 the game as you see runs pretty fluid 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.270
 even though the recording of the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.280
 My device screen requires 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 a lot of ram and that makes the game run 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.760
 at a speed a little lower than what 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.960
 that runs the game when I'm not 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.960
 recording the screen 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.530
 usually as you already know to be able 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.540
 play in a fluid way the games 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.280
 for this emulator we need a 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.020
 device that has at least one 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.120
 dual core processor but if 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.920
 they have a device with only one core 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.959
 and at a giga hertz of speed can 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.610
 try to install this game since such 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.610
 once it works for them in a good way 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.640
