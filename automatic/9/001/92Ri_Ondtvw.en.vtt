ability to kill as fast as other weapons

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580

out<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.759> where<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> makes<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
out there where it makes up for this is

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
out there where it makes up for this is
its<00:01:46.860> complete<00:01:47.369> lack<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> recoil<00:01:48.450> you'll<00:01:48.780> see

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
its complete lack of recoil you'll see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.280 
its complete lack of recoil you'll see
here<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.740> am<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.700> laser<00:01:51.479> beaming<00:01:51.960> people

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
here that I am just laser beaming people

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
here that I am just laser beaming people
from<00:01:52.470> across<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.040> map<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.520> I've<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
from across the map now I've got the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.569 
from across the map now I've got the
muzzle<00:01:54.270> brake<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.930> which<00:01:55.500> does<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.340> fact

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
muzzle brake on here which does in fact

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.899 
muzzle brake on here which does in fact
make<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> recoil<00:01:57.420> even<00:01:57.869> last<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.469> know

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
make the recoil even last and I know

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.880 
make the recoil even last and I know
this<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> necessary<00:01:59.600> add-on<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.770> this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
this is a necessary add-on to this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.649 
this is a necessary add-on to this
weapon<00:02:01.130> in<00:02:01.729> fact<00:02:01.969> I<00:02:02.090> think<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.390> would<00:02:02.509> rather

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
weapon in fact I think I would rather

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.099 
weapon in fact I think I would rather
just<00:02:02.990> not<00:02:03.229> have<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.920> barrel<00:02:04.719> attachment<00:02:05.719> on

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
just not have the barrel attachment on

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.020 
just not have the barrel attachment on
there<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:06.770> go<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.549> accuracy

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
there and just go with the accuracy

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
there and just go with the accuracy
rather<00:02:08.420> than<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> recoil<00:02:09.200> reduction<00:02:09.410> because

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
rather than the recoil reduction because

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.100 
rather than the recoil reduction because
I'm<00:02:10.250> able<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:11.000> control<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> recoil<00:02:11.629> on<00:02:11.930> this

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
I'm able to control the recoil on this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.559 
I'm able to control the recoil on this
weapon<00:02:12.260> even<00:02:13.040> without<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.670> muzzle<00:02:14.030> break<00:02:14.239> and

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
weapon even without the muzzle break and

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.570 
weapon even without the muzzle break and
I<00:02:14.810> apologize<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:15.590> I'm<00:02:15.739> getting<00:02:15.980> ahead<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.310> some

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
I apologize if I'm getting ahead of some

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640 
I apologize if I'm getting ahead of some
people<00:02:16.849> there<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.239> muzzle<00:02:17.569> break<00:02:17.840> reduces

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
people there the muzzle break reduces

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.410 
people there the muzzle break reduces
the<00:02:18.769> recoil<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> weapon<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the recoil of the weapon but it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.509 
the recoil of the weapon but it
sacrifices<00:02:21.200> your<00:02:21.349> accuracy<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> same

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
sacrifices your accuracy at the same

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.580 
sacrifices your accuracy at the same
time<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.629> get<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> weapon<00:02:24.049> that's<00:02:24.319> very

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
time so if you get a weapon that's very

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.259 
time so if you get a weapon that's very
hard<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.010> handle<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> feeling<00:02:26.120> we're

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
hard to handle I have a feeling we're

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.440 
hard to handle I have a feeling we're
gonna<00:02:26.360> run<00:02:26.660> into<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.019> few<00:02:27.319> maybe<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.450> aek-971

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
gonna run into a few maybe the aek-971

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.839 
gonna run into a few maybe the aek-971
in<00:02:30.049> final<00:02:30.590> release<00:02:30.890> will<00:02:31.099> need<00:02:31.310> some<00:02:31.489> help

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
in final release will need some help

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.000 
in final release will need some help
handling<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.629> recoil<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.530> perhaps<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
handling that recoil then perhaps the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.280 
handling that recoil then perhaps the
muzzle<00:02:34.280> break<00:02:34.459> will<00:02:34.670> be<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.329> wiser<00:02:36.079> choice

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
muzzle break will be the wiser choice

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.979 
muzzle break will be the wiser choice
for<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> weapon<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> ak-12<00:02:38.569> it's

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
for that weapon but for the ak-12 it's

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.720 
for that weapon but for the ak-12 it's
very<00:02:39.230> accurate<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.829> has<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.950> low<00:02:40.220> rate<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.549> fire

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
very accurate it has a low rate of fire

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.270 
very accurate it has a low rate of fire
the<00:02:40.910> recoils<00:02:41.569> easy<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.140> manage<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.010> doesn't

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the recoils easy to manage so it doesn't

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 
the recoils easy to manage so it doesn't
really<00:02:43.489> make<00:02:43.790> sense<00:02:43.819> attaching<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.959> this

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
really make sense attaching that to this

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.789 
really make sense attaching that to this
weapon

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
weapon

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.130 
weapon
now<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.220> ergo<00:02:46.760> grip<00:02:47.030> does<00:02:47.360> make<00:02:47.629> sense<00:02:47.900> in

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
now the ergo grip does make sense in

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.979 
now the ergo grip does make sense in
fact<00:02:48.379> any<00:02:48.650> sort<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.190> grip<00:02:49.549> on<00:02:49.790> any<00:02:50.329> weapon<00:02:50.660> is

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
fact any sort of grip on any weapon is

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.140 
fact any sort of grip on any weapon is
going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> beneficial<00:02:52.129> no<00:02:52.549> longer<00:02:52.970> do<00:02:53.120> we

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
going to be beneficial no longer do we

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.170 
going to be beneficial no longer do we
have<00:02:53.299> accuracy<00:02:54.079> penalties<00:02:54.769> from<00:02:55.640> battlefield

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
have accuracy penalties from battlefield

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030 
have accuracy penalties from battlefield
3<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.720> battlefield<00:02:57.260> 3<00:02:57.349> if<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.680> wanted<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
3 in battlefield 3 if you wanted the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.229 
3 in battlefield 3 if you wanted the
foregrip<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.579> would<00:02:58.670> reduce<00:02:58.879> your

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
foregrip it would reduce your

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.880 
foregrip it would reduce your
side-to-side<00:02:59.720> recoil<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.709> would

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
side-to-side recoil but it would

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.979 
side-to-side recoil but it would
decrease<00:03:01.489> your<00:03:01.970> aiming-down-sights

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
decrease your aiming-down-sights

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.740 
decrease your aiming-down-sights
accuracy<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.310> don't<00:03:04.639> have<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.239> penalty

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
accuracy now we don't have that penalty

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.110 
accuracy now we don't have that penalty
so<00:03:06.049> basically<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:07.220> should<00:03:07.489> be<00:03:07.670> running<00:03:07.880> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
so basically you should be running a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.089 
so basically you should be running a
foregrip<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.840> weapon<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.980> to

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
foregrip on a weapon it's going to

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.190 
foregrip on a weapon it's going to
improve<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.670> some<00:03:10.940> way<00:03:11.150> or<00:03:11.599> another<00:03:11.810> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
improve it in some way or another and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.780 
improve it in some way or another and
the<00:03:12.319> Ergo<00:03:12.620> grip<00:03:12.650> improves<00:03:13.310> your<00:03:13.430> hipfire

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the Ergo grip improves your hipfire

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.240 
the Ergo grip improves your hipfire
accuracy<00:03:14.239> by<00:03:14.930> making<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.530> more<00:03:16.010> accurate

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
accuracy by making you more accurate

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.129 
accuracy by making you more accurate
while<00:03:16.849> you're<00:03:17.090> shooting<00:03:17.329> from<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> hip<00:03:17.959> and

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
while you're shooting from the hip and

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.740 
while you're shooting from the hip and
moving<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.519> pretty<00:03:19.880> much<00:03:20.060> great<00:03:20.359> for<00:03:20.599> any

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
moving this is pretty much great for any

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.300 
moving this is pretty much great for any
weapon<00:03:21.169> out<00:03:21.290> there<00:03:21.319> who<00:03:21.680> doesn't<00:03:21.889> want<00:03:22.160> better

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
weapon out there who doesn't want better

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.610 
weapon out there who doesn't want better
hipfire<00:03:22.730> accuracy<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.540> then<00:03:24.049> when<00:03:24.319> we<00:03:24.440> throw

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
hipfire accuracy and then when we throw

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.289 
hipfire accuracy and then when we throw
the<00:03:24.769> laser<00:03:24.980> sight<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:25.669> that<00:03:25.910> further

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
the laser sight on there that further

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.780 
the laser sight on there that further
improves<00:03:26.959> your<00:03:27.109> hipfire<00:03:27.349> accuracy<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.609> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
improves your hipfire accuracy and I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.979 
improves your hipfire accuracy and I
think<00:03:29.060> we're<00:03:29.209> gonna<00:03:29.299> see<00:03:29.569> this<00:03:29.720> combination

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
think we're gonna see this combination

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.550 
think we're gonna see this combination
of<00:03:30.620> ergo<00:03:31.010> grip<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.519> laser<00:03:31.760> sight<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.480> lot<00:03:33.290> in

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
of ergo grip and laser sight a lot in

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.559 
of ergo grip and laser sight a lot in
battlefield<00:03:34.130> 4<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.180> wouldn't<00:03:35.450> be

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
battlefield 4 and I wouldn't be

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.750 
battlefield 4 and I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.079> see<00:03:36.260> some<00:03:36.530> PDW<00:03:37.280> coming<00:03:37.609> out

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
surprised to see some PDW coming out

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.250 
surprised to see some PDW coming out
that<00:03:37.940> they're<00:03:38.030> just<00:03:38.209> gonna<00:03:38.359> turn<00:03:38.599> into<00:03:38.840> laser

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
that they're just gonna turn into laser

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.409 
that they're just gonna turn into laser
beams<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.859> death<00:03:40.099> while<00:03:40.609> shooting<00:03:41.090> from<00:03:41.269> the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
beams of death while shooting from the

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.360 
beams of death while shooting from the
hip<00:03:41.540> i<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:42.019> can't<00:03:42.290> wait<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.590> play<00:03:42.769> around<00:03:43.069> with

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
hip i I can't wait to play around with

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.089 
hip i I can't wait to play around with
some<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.030> powerful<00:03:44.359> hipfire<00:03:45.019> weapons<00:03:45.530> now

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
some really powerful hipfire weapons now

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.159 
some really powerful hipfire weapons now
fortunately<00:03:46.700> we<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.209> some<00:03:47.419> nice<00:03:47.540> stats<00:03:47.930> from

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.000 
sympathic comm these are all gathered
from<00:03:50.180> in-game<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.049> they've<00:03:51.200> been<00:03:51.380> testing

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
from in-game so they've been testing

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.009 
from in-game so they've been testing
timings<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.730> stuff<00:03:52.940> like<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.359> we<00:03:53.540> do<00:03:53.780> have

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
timings and stuff like that we do have

reload is actually two seconds which is
a<00:03:59.030> huge<00:03:59.450> improvement<00:04:00.049> over<00:04:00.230> battlefield<00:04:00.980> 3

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
a huge improvement over battlefield 3

a huge improvement over battlefield 3
aka<00:04:01.760> weapons<00:04:02.239> now<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.780> would<00:04:03.079> say<00:04:03.230> battlefield

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
have to make them a little bit more

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.610 
have to make them a little bit more
competitive<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.540> especially<00:04:10.989> considering

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
competitive and especially considering

competitive and especially considering
that<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:12.069> ak-12<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> slow<00:04:13.360> firing<00:04:13.750> weapon

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
that the ak-12 is a slow firing weapon

that the ak-12 is a slow firing weapon
we're<00:04:14.470> gonna<00:04:14.590> need<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.980> do<00:04:15.099> something<00:04:15.550> to<00:04:15.730> it

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
we're gonna need to do something to it

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.240 
we're gonna need to do something to it
to<00:04:16.090> balance<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.109> out<00:04:17.229> make<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.739> little<00:04:18.010> bit

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
let's talk about burst fire mode

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.020 
let's talk about burst fire mode
previous<00:04:29.800> battlefield<00:04:30.310> games<00:04:30.580> had<00:04:30.820> burst

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
previous battlefield games had burst

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.030 
previous battlefield games had burst
fire<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.540> lot<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.750> weapons<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:32.860> our

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
fire on a lot of weapons and then our

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.610 
fire on a lot of weapons and then our
Sun<00:04:33.250> guns<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.669> only<00:04:33.820> had<00:04:34.060> burst<00:04:34.300> fire

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
Sun guns that only had burst fire

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.469 
Sun guns that only had burst fire
available<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.830> them<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.729> frankly<00:04:36.940> wasn't

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
available to them and it frankly wasn't

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.969 
available to them and it frankly wasn't
a<00:04:37.540> huge<00:04:37.810> improvement<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.560> remember<00:04:38.889> the

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
a huge improvement and remember the

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.150 
a huge improvement and remember the
m16a4<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:40.240> thinking<00:04:40.630> how<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.320> really<00:04:41.950> wasn't

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
m16a4 just thinking how it really wasn't

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.280 
m16a4 just thinking how it really wasn't
a<00:04:42.340> very<00:04:42.370> big<00:04:42.729> improvement<00:04:43.120> over<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.600> m16a3

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
a very big improvement over the m16a3

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.500 
a very big improvement over the m16a3
they<00:04:45.100> tried<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.370> give<00:04:45.610> them<00:04:45.790> better<00:04:45.940> accuracy

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
they tried to give them better accuracy

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.719 
they tried to give them better accuracy
but<00:04:47.020> ultimately<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.740> recoil<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.520> burst

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
but ultimately the recoil of the burst

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.610 
but ultimately the recoil of the burst
fire<00:04:48.820> weapons<00:04:49.389> just<00:04:49.540> made<00:04:49.780> them<00:04:49.960> more

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
fire weapons just made them more

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.770 
fire weapons just made them more
difficult<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.460> use<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.450> there<00:04:52.600> wasn't

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
difficult to use and so there wasn't

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.870 
difficult to use and so there wasn't
really<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.169> lot<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.470> reason<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.040> choose<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.490> burst

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
really a lot of reason to choose a burst

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.730 
really a lot of reason to choose a burst
fire<00:04:55.180> weapon<00:04:55.210> over<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.320> full-auto

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
just got the full auto weapons and they

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.400 
just got the full auto weapons and they
seem<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.210> have<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.600> burst<00:05:01.840> fire<00:05:01.930> option

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
seem to have the burst fire option

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.379 
seem to have the burst fire option
unless<00:05:02.889> some<00:05:03.160> of<00:05:03.280> them<00:05:03.400> are<00:05:03.580> limited<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:04.210> burst

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
unless some of them are limited to burst

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.900 
unless some of them are limited to burst
fire<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.990> m16<00:05:05.530> 84<00:05:05.979> but<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.639> time

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
fire like the m16 84 but this time

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.640 
fire like the m16 84 but this time
around<00:05:07.060> dice<00:05:07.449> has<00:05:07.660> given<00:05:07.990> us<00:05:08.110> some<00:05:08.320> serious

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
around dice has given us some serious

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.680 
around dice has given us some serious
food<00:05:09.100> for<00:05:09.370> thought<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.880> debating<00:05:10.270> whether<00:05:10.570> or

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
food for thought in debating whether or

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.360 
food for thought in debating whether or
not<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:11.050> want<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.289> fire<00:05:11.440> your<00:05:11.680> weapon<00:05:11.979> on<00:05:12.070> full

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
per minute on full auto when you set it

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.710 
per minute on full auto when you set it
to<00:05:20.590> burst<00:05:20.860> fire<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.550> shoots<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:22.120> thousand

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
to burst fire it shoots a thousand

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.650 
to burst fire it shoots a thousand
rounds<00:05:22.900> per<00:05:23.200> minute<00:05:23.440> now<00:05:23.830> that's<00:05:24.070> in<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.310> small

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
rounds per minute now that's in a small

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.930 
rounds per minute now that's in a small
three<00:05:25.660> round<00:05:25.960> burst<00:05:26.349> but<00:05:26.860> still<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.250> thousand

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
three round burst but still a thousand

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.370 
three round burst but still a thousand
rounds<00:05:28.060> per<00:05:28.389> minute<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.900> three<00:05:29.139> round

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
rounds per minute and a three round

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.800 
rounds per minute and a three round
burst<00:05:29.650> means<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.160> you<00:05:30.580> actually<00:05:30.970> now<00:05:31.210> have<00:05:31.570> a

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
burst means that you actually now have a

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.529 
burst means that you actually now have a
really<00:05:32.320> significant<00:05:33.250> factor<00:05:33.760> bringing<00:05:34.419> you

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
really significant factor bringing you

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.060 
really significant factor bringing you
back<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:34.900> burst<00:05:35.260> fire<00:05:35.500> mode<00:05:35.530> it's<00:05:36.010> a

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
back to that burst fire mode it's a

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.320 
back to that burst fire mode it's a
little<00:05:36.310> bit<00:05:36.430> harder<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.789> use<00:05:36.910> because<00:05:37.240> you

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
little bit harder to use because you

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.810 
little bit harder to use because you
have<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.720> repeat<00:05:38.500> clicking<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.460> basically

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
have to repeat clicking you basically

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.909 
have to repeat clicking you basically
have<00:05:40.030> to<00:05:40.180> tap<00:05:40.389> fire<00:05:40.660> the<00:05:40.870> weapon<00:05:41.260> instead<00:05:41.830> of

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
have to tap fire the weapon instead of

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.860 
have to tap fire the weapon instead of
just<00:05:42.070> holding<00:05:42.430> down<00:05:42.639> for<00:05:42.880> full<00:05:43.120> auto<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.720> then

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
just holding down for full auto and then

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.570 
just holding down for full auto and then
it's<00:05:44.139> been<00:05:44.410> really<00:05:44.530> easier<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.070> compensate

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
it's been really easier to compensate

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.190 
it's been really easier to compensate
for<00:05:45.700> recoil<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.330> full<00:05:46.539> auto<00:05:46.720> because<00:05:46.990> you

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
for recoil in full auto because you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.409 
for recoil in full auto because you
don't<00:05:47.349> have<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.560> continuously<00:05:48.099> tap<00:05:48.820> fire<00:05:49.060> and

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
don't have to continuously tap fire and

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.600 
don't have to continuously tap fire and
re-experience<00:05:50.110> that<00:05:50.500> first<00:05:50.770> round<00:05:51.010> recoil

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
re-experience that first round recoil

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.120 
re-experience that first round recoil
multiplier<00:05:51.789> but<00:05:52.720> at<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.990> same<00:05:53.169> time<00:05:53.470> having<00:05:53.800> a

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
multiplier but at the same time having a

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.430 
multiplier but at the same time having a
rate<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.520> fire<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:55.210> thousand<00:05:55.870> all<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.380> a

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
rate of fire of the thousand all of a

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.379 
rate of fire of the thousand all of a
sudden<00:05:56.740> is<00:05:56.860> a<00:05:56.889> big<00:05:57.310> game-changer<00:05:57.639> and<00:05:58.180> if<00:05:58.270> you

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
sudden is a big game-changer and if you

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.779 
sudden is a big game-changer and if you
can<00:05:58.539> master<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.200> burst<00:05:59.410> fire<00:05:59.500> on<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> ak-12<00:06:00.340> I

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
can master the burst fire on the ak-12 I

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.150 
can master the burst fire on the ak-12 I
gotta<00:06:01.300> say<00:06:01.570> it's<00:06:02.289> gonna<00:06:02.470> be<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:02.710> much<00:06:02.919> more

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
gotta say it's gonna be a much more

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.730 
gotta say it's gonna be a much more
effective<00:06:03.639> on<00:06:03.789> burst<00:06:04.090> fire<00:06:04.330> in<00:06:04.750> full<00:06:05.110> auto<00:06:05.380> and

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
effective on burst fire in full auto and

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.680 
effective on burst fire in full auto and
when<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.099> started<00:06:06.460> doing<00:06:06.580> burst<00:06:06.910> fire<00:06:07.090> my<00:06:07.330> KD<00:06:07.570> r

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
when I started doing burst fire my KD r

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.850 
when I started doing burst fire my KD r
just<00:06:07.960> went<00:06:08.229> up<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:08.710> started<00:06:09.160> doing

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
just went up I started doing

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.920 
just went up I started doing
and<00:06:10.550> I<00:06:10.610> was<00:06:10.729> able<00:06:10.849> to<00:06:11.000> take<00:06:11.270> down<00:06:11.419> people<00:06:11.810> at

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
and I was able to take down people at

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.860 
and I was able to take down people at
range<00:06:12.229> in<00:06:13.099> just<00:06:13.400> very<00:06:13.759> short<00:06:14.120> time<00:06:14.419> periods

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
range in just very short time periods

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.300 
range in just very short time periods
now<00:06:15.169> of<00:06:15.289> course<00:06:15.439> there<00:06:15.650> were<00:06:15.770> moments<00:06:16.009> in

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
now of course there were moments in

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.649 
now of course there were moments in
close<00:06:16.520> quarters<00:06:16.879> where<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.120> was<00:06:17.270> thinking<00:06:17.539> you

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
close quarters where I was thinking you

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:18.850 
close quarters where I was thinking you
know<00:06:17.780> what<00:06:17.900> I<00:06:17.930> would<00:06:18.199> have<00:06:18.319> killed<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:18.680> guy

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
know what I would have killed that guy

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.320 
know what I would have killed that guy
if<00:06:18.949> I<00:06:19.069> had<00:06:19.159> it<00:06:19.280> on<00:06:19.430> full<00:06:19.699> auto<00:06:19.939> because

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
if I had it on full auto because

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.790 
if I had it on full auto because
burst-fire<00:06:20.599> messed<00:06:21.050> me<00:06:21.169> up<00:06:21.199> a<00:06:21.379> little<00:06:21.620> bit

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
burst-fire messed me up a little bit

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.129 
burst-fire messed me up a little bit
then<00:06:22.400> again<00:06:22.699> it's<00:06:22.939> that<00:06:23.120> sort<00:06:23.509> of<00:06:23.599> issue<00:06:23.810> of

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
then again it's that sort of issue of

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.619 
then again it's that sort of issue of
it's<00:06:24.469> a<00:06:24.620> hard<00:06:24.919> weapon<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.580> use<00:06:25.819> but<00:06:26.210> if<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.330> put

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
it's a hard weapon to use but if you put

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.149 
it's a hard weapon to use but if you put
in<00:06:26.719> the<00:06:26.840> time<00:06:27.080> to<00:06:27.110> get<00:06:27.409> skilled<00:06:27.800> with<00:06:28.009> it

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
in the time to get skilled with it

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.029 
in the time to get skilled with it
master<00:06:28.669> you<00:06:29.030> will<00:06:29.300> be<00:06:29.569> rewarded<00:06:29.840> more<00:06:30.530> so<00:06:30.800> than

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
master you will be rewarded more so than

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.100 
master you will be rewarded more so than
taking<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.520> easy<00:06:31.759> route<00:06:32.090> which<00:06:32.599> in<00:06:32.780> this<00:06:32.900> case

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
taking the easy route which in this case
