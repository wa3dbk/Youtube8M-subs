five

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.710 
five
we<00:01:04.799> learned<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.189> Tara's<00:01:05.549> alive<00:01:05.820> somehow<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we learned that Tara's alive somehow and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
we learned that Tara's alive somehow and
we<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.340> explanation<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.210> she

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we don't get an explanation and she

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
we don't get an explanation and she
doesn't<00:01:09.479> recognize<00:01:09.630> Beast<00:01:10.170> Boy<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.770> should

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
doesn't recognize Beast Boy so should

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.140 
doesn't recognize Beast Boy so should
they<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.119> season<00:01:12.630> six<00:01:13.340> maybe<00:01:14.340> season<00:01:14.820> seven

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
they do a season six maybe season seven

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
they do a season six maybe season seven
just<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> wrap<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> story<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.360> say<00:01:18.360> yes<00:01:18.770> now

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just to wrap up that story I say yes now

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.370 
just to wrap up that story I say yes now
the<00:01:19.830> reason<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> closure<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.900> lot<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the reason is closure you know a lot of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
the reason is closure you know a lot of
the<00:01:22.680> earlier<00:01:23.189> DC<00:01:23.790> shows<00:01:24.090> didn't<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.080> closure

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the earlier DC shows didn't have closure

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.910 
the earlier DC shows didn't have closure
and<00:01:26.210> it's<00:01:27.210> disappointing<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.110> basically

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and it's disappointing because basically

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.050 
and it's disappointing because basically
the<00:01:29.040> reason<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.340> didn't<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.640> closure<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the reason they didn't get closure is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
the reason they didn't get closure is
because<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.630> didn't<00:01:30.960> write<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> tech

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
because they didn't write it tech

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
because they didn't write it tech
closure<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.689> how

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
closure because they didn't know how

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
closure because they didn't know how
many<00:01:34.049> seasons<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.490> because

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
many seasons it would have see because

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
many seasons it would have see because
the<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> works<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.990> Warner<00:01:37.409> Brothers

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the way it works with Warner Brothers

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
the way it works with Warner Brothers
really<00:01:37.950> works<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.369> anything<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.000> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
really works with anything is that they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140 
really works with anything is that they
really<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> most<00:01:40.920> part<00:01:41.189> most<00:01:41.490> series<00:01:41.909> do

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really for the most part most series do

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
really for the most part most series do
not<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.659> how<00:01:43.439> long<00:01:43.740> they're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> carry

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
not know how long they're going to carry

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
not know how long they're going to carry

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
on they just write a season and hope

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
on they just write a season and hope
that<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.100> renewed<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.689> Warner

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that they get renewed and for Warner

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.359 
that they get renewed and for Warner
Brothers<00:01:49.200> especially<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:49.890> how<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> works

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
Brothers especially that's how it works

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
Brothers especially that's how it works
they<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.970> told<00:01:51.210> hey<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.869> prove

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
they are told hey you're gonna prove

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
they are told hey you're gonna prove
this<00:01:52.829> many<00:01:53.100> episodes<00:01:53.399> write<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> story<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this many episodes write a story and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
this many episodes write a story and
that's<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.860> well<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> mean<00:01:56.850> they're<00:01:57.090> just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that's it well I mean they're just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.670 
that's it well I mean they're just
character<00:01:57.570> restrictors<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.229> sure<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.500> well

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
character restrictors I'm sure as well

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
character restrictors I'm sure as well
and<00:01:59.070> censorship<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.850> aside<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and censorship but aside from that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.940 
and censorship but aside from that
that's<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.229> works<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.500> Warner<00:02:01.799> Brothers

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that's how it works with Warner Brothers

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850 
that's how it works with Warner Brothers
so<00:02:02.420> that's<00:02:03.420> why<00:02:03.600> Teen<00:02:03.840> Titans<00:02:04.200> randomly<00:02:04.590> got

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so that's why Teen Titans randomly got

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
so that's why Teen Titans randomly got
cut<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> creator's<00:02:06.750> wanted

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
cut off not because the creator's wanted

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
cut off not because the creator's wanted
to<00:02:07.079> end<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.610> Warner

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to end it I'm sure it's just that Warner

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
to end it I'm sure it's just that Warner
Brothers<00:02:09.509> was<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:10.319> done<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.679> Teen

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
Brothers was like we're done with Teen

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.970 
Brothers was like we're done with Teen
Titans<00:02:11.190> move<00:02:11.580> along<00:02:12.260> probably<00:02:13.260> because

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
Titans move along probably because

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
Titans move along probably because
well<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.790> was<00:02:14.880> around<00:02:15.120> when<00:02:15.390> Justice<00:02:15.690> League

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
well it was around when Justice League

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.730 
well it was around when Justice League
was<00:02:15.990> around<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.410> why<00:02:16.590> they

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
was around I don't know why they

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.460 
was around I don't know why they
honestly<00:02:17.220> cancelled<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.480> whatever<00:02:18.780> I'll

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
honestly cancelled it but whatever I'll

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
honestly cancelled it but whatever I'll
never<00:02:19.709> understand<00:02:20.160> Warner<00:02:20.459> Brothers

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
never understand Warner Brothers

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.630 
never understand Warner Brothers
sometimes<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.840> basically<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> reason<00:02:23.280> why<00:02:23.400> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
sometimes but basically the reason why I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
sometimes but basically the reason why I
just<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.810> show<00:02:25.050> needs<00:02:25.500> closure

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
just think that the show needs closure

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.520 
just think that the show needs closure
it<00:02:26.400> was<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.480> good<00:02:27.630> show<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:28.110> mean

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it was a really really good show I mean

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.350 
it was a really really good show I mean
especially<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:29.160> Teen<00:02:29.340> Titans<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.180> TV

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
especially with Teen Titans go now on TV

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
especially with Teen Titans go now on TV
now<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> original<00:02:30.989> boys<00:02:31.410> cast<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.980> still

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
now the original boys cast is still

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.030 
now the original boys cast is still
there<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.000> they're<00:02:33.750> still<00:02:33.780> interest<00:02:34.470> clearly

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
there and they're still interest clearly

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
there and they're still interest clearly
it's<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.459> relevant<00:02:35.850> show<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:36.690> still<00:02:36.989> relevant

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
a new show so I believe that Cartoon

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300 
a new show so I believe that Cartoon
Network<00:02:42.600> should<00:02:42.780> seriously<00:02:43.080> consider<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

know with the same style the same voice

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.250 
know with the same style the same voice
actors<00:02:46.319> do<00:02:47.300> however<00:02:48.300> many<00:02:48.450> seasons<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:49.050> want

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
actors do however many seasons they want

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.920 
actors do however many seasons they want
to<00:02:49.350> do<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.590> conclude<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> story<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:51.239> maybe<00:02:51.540> do

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
to do to conclude the story or maybe do

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.720 
to do to conclude the story or maybe do
a<00:02:51.959> new<00:02:52.470> series<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.890> takes<00:02:53.190> place<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.549> same

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.320 
continuity whatever they want to do I
just<00:02:56.100> think<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.519> should<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.850> Teen

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
just think that they should do a Teen

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.660 
just think that they should do a Teen
Titans<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.080> not<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.680> Teen<00:02:58.980> Titans<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.549> new
