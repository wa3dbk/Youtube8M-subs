00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
developer the philosophy at Ford is you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
developer the philosophy at Ford is you
have<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> bringing<00:02:37.920> device<00:02:38.189> as<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.609> driver<00:02:38.970> that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
have a bringing device as a driver that

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750 
have a bringing device as a driver that
you<00:02:39.689> have<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> relationship<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
you have a relationship with and you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.449 
you have a relationship with and you
have<00:02:41.909> a<00:02:41.939> relationship<00:02:42.389> with<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> application

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
have a relationship with the application

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.429 
have a relationship with the application
so<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.879> application<00:02:45.510> developer<00:02:45.989> knows

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
so is the application developer knows

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.460 
so is the application developer knows
their<00:02:46.769> customer<00:02:47.219> best<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.959> give<00:02:49.200> them<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
their customer best so we give them the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.160 
their customer best so we give them the
technology<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.849> choose<00:02:51.180> how<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> extend

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
technology and they choose how to extend

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.979 
technology and they choose how to extend
in<00:02:52.500> terms<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.099> language<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:54.510> verbs
