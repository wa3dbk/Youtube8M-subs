00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.900 
what's up guys wham here and I got you
another<00:00:08.560> minecraft<00:00:08.860> video<00:00:09.190> because<00:00:09.640> my

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
another minecraft video because my

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.970 
another minecraft video because my
capture<00:00:10.750> card<00:00:10.780> is<00:00:11.110> not<00:00:11.260> working<00:00:11.320> right<00:00:11.800> now

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
capture card is not working right now

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.850 
capture card is not working right now
wow<00:00:12.430> it's<00:00:13.059> not<00:00:13.270> really<00:00:13.510> settle<00:00:13.780> properly<00:00:14.230> so

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
wow it's not really settle properly so

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.920 
wow it's not really settle properly so
at<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:15.670> moment<00:00:15.790> I'm<00:00:16.030> not<00:00:16.150> going<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.420> be

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
at the moment I'm not going to be

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.750 
at the moment I'm not going to be
recording<00:00:17.560> much<00:00:17.850> um<00:00:19.110> but<00:00:20.110> yeah<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:21.250> today<00:00:21.550> I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
recording much um but yeah so today I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.950 
recording much um but yeah so today I
thought<00:00:21.790> I'd<00:00:22.030> bring<00:00:22.150> you<00:00:22.240> some<00:00:22.540> redstone

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
thought I'd bring you some redstone

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.820 
thought I'd bring you some redstone
stuff<00:00:23.560> again<00:00:23.800> it's<00:00:24.640> solve<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.480> test<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:27.340> have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
stuff again it's solve a test and I have

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.000 
stuff again it's solve a test and I have
Pistons<00:00:29.830> installed<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:31.259> really<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.439> just<00:00:32.680> make

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
Pistons installed and really I just make

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.900 
Pistons installed and really I just make
it<00:00:33.160> mid<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.850> over<00:00:34.180> complicated<00:00:34.750> circuit<00:00:35.290> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it mid and over complicated circuit to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.720 
it mid and over complicated circuit to
set<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.000> T&amp;T<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.920> I've<00:00:39.100> only<00:00:39.190> got<00:00:39.370> four<00:00:39.579> of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
set of T&amp;T which I've only got four of

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.639 
set of T&amp;T which I've only got four of
Sam<00:00:40.210> haven't<00:00:40.539> spawned<00:00:40.809> any<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.289> into<00:00:41.559> the

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
Sam haven't spawned any of this into the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.560 
Sam haven't spawned any of this into the
world<00:00:41.859> I<00:00:42.070> have<00:00:42.249> gone<00:00:42.489> into<00:00:42.670> my<00:00:42.879> mind<00:00:43.089> over<00:00:43.390> here

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
world I have gone into my mind over here

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.590 
world I have gone into my mind over here
and<00:00:43.859> collected<00:00:44.859> all<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.760> everything

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
and collected all of it so everything

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.669 
and collected all of it so everything
you<00:00:46.629> see<00:00:46.719> is<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.649> legit<00:00:48.239> okay<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:49.629> that's<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
you see is it legit okay so that's the

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.649 
you see is it legit okay so that's the
overcomplicated<00:00:51.609> side<00:00:51.819> you<00:00:52.210> don't<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.480> don't

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
overcomplicated side you don't we don't

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.630 
overcomplicated side you don't we don't
need<00:00:52.749> that<00:00:52.899> yet<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.969> a<00:00:55.030> simple<00:00:55.480> one<00:00:55.749> okay

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
need that yet this is a simple one okay

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.599 
need that yet this is a simple one okay
so<00:00:57.640> basically<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:59.170> lever<00:00:59.530> when<00:01:00.429> it's

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
so basically this lever when it's

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.590 
so basically this lever when it's
activated<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.839> will<00:01:01.899> deactivate<00:01:02.559> this<00:01:03.600> since

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
activated it will deactivate this since

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.270 
activated it will deactivate this since
this<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.809> already<00:01:04.960> activated<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.860> place<00:01:06.130> at

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
this is already activated and I place at

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.790 
this is already activated and I place at
emt<00:01:06.700> down<00:01:06.909> there<00:01:07.120> it<00:01:07.270> will<00:01:07.420> not<00:01:07.630> set<00:01:07.870> off<00:01:07.990> until

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
emt down there it will not set off until

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.999 
emt down there it will not set off until
it's<00:01:08.979> activated<00:01:09.549> as<00:01:09.939> in<00:01:10.360> reactivated<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.950> to

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
it's activated as in reactivated so to

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.179 
it's activated as in reactivated so to
do<00:01:12.219> that<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.600> will<00:01:13.780> turn<00:01:13.930> off<00:01:14.140> which<00:01:15.009> will

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
do that that will turn off which will

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.730 
do that that will turn off which will
turn<00:01:15.399> this<00:01:15.579> circuit<00:01:16.030> off<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.619> will

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
turn this circuit off but it will

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.730 
turn this circuit off but it will
activate<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.899> which<00:01:19.899> pushes<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.530> piston

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
activate that which pushes the piston

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.770 
activate that which pushes the piston
which<00:01:21.670> breaks<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> redstone<00:01:22.600> circuit

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
which breaks the redstone circuit

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.660 
which breaks the redstone circuit
turning<00:01:23.409> that<00:01:23.500> back<00:01:23.710> on<00:01:23.920> which<00:01:24.490> will

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
turning that back on which will

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.850 
turning that back on which will
reactivate<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.420> TNT<00:01:26.189> okay<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.750> if<00:01:29.140> this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
reactivate the TNT okay that if this

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.899 
reactivate the TNT okay that if this
doesn't<00:01:30.219> set<00:01:30.340> off<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.640> haven't<00:01:30.759> actually

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
doesn't set off I haven't actually

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.340 
doesn't set off I haven't actually
tested<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.649> they<00:01:32.649> were<00:01:32.740> go<00:01:33.030> sorted<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
tested this they were go sorted and I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.230 
tested this they were go sorted and I
don't<00:01:35.530> know<00:01:35.619> how<00:01:36.039> much<00:01:36.369> damage<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.000> going<00:01:37.180> to

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
don't know how much damage it's going to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.149 
don't know how much damage it's going to
do<00:01:38.159> may<00:01:39.159> even<00:01:39.340> damage<00:01:39.789> this<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:42.009> we'll

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
do may even damage this and but we'll

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.510 
do may even damage this and but we'll
see<00:01:42.310> right<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:44.020> plan<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:45.039> activate

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
see right the the plan is we activate

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.539 
see right the the plan is we activate
this<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.960> piston<00:01:47.320> push<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.770> has

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
this see the piston push that has

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
this see the piston push that has
reactivated<00:01:49.149> should<00:01:49.960> hear<00:01:50.109> an<00:01:50.200> explosion<00:01:50.289> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
reactivated should hear an explosion a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.219 
reactivated should hear an explosion a
good<00:01:53.890> work<00:01:55.109> right<00:01:56.109> oh<00:01:56.439> god<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.079> in

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
this Oh God the massive hole under my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.580 
this Oh God the massive hole under my
house<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.570> need<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> replace<00:02:16.260> some

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
house and I just need to replace some

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.650 
house and I just need to replace some
blocks<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.420> some<00:02:18.420> missing<00:02:18.900> blocks<00:02:19.790> act<00:02:20.790> okay

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
blocks here some missing blocks act okay

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.800 
blocks here some missing blocks act okay
on<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:23.240> right<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.660> that's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
on to this one right now that that's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
on to this one right now that that's
hardly<00:02:25.050> set<00:02:25.320> off<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.740> can't<00:02:26.220> use<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.610> circuit

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
hardly set off I can't use this circuit

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.770 
hardly set off I can't use this circuit
again<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> idea<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:29.600> they<00:02:30.600> would

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
again but the idea is that they would

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
again but the idea is that they would
that<00:02:31.140> whole<00:02:31.500> thing<00:02:31.710> would<00:02:32.040> still<00:02:32.190> wish<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.640> up

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
that whole thing would still wish it up

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.180 
that whole thing would still wish it up
ok<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.100> turn<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.210> off<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> we'll

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
ok so then turn this back off and we'll

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.670 
ok so then turn this back off and we'll
put<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.700> pissed<00:02:39.240> on<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:40.730> ok<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.410> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
put a pissed on here ok so on this is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
put a pissed on here ok so on this is
basically<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.190> same<00:02:44.220> that's<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.210> turning

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
basically the same that's on turning

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.560 
basically the same that's on turning
this<00:02:46.200> off<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.890> whole<00:02:47.130> circuit<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.700> off<00:02:47.910> apart

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
this off this whole circuit is off apart

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.960 
this off this whole circuit is off apart
from<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.710> places<00:02:50.130> where<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> TNT<00:02:50.820> will

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
from the places where the TNT will

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.460 
from the places where the TNT will
replace<00:02:51.500> which<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:52.770> place<00:02:53.040> now<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:57.470> this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
replace which I will place now and this

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
replace which I will place now and this
is<00:02:58.770> again<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.640> over<00:02:59.940> complicated<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
is again it's just over complicated you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.110 
is again it's just over complicated you
would<00:03:00.660> never<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.610> know<00:03:02.730> i<00:03:02.760> just

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
would never use this but you know i just

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.580 
would never use this but you know i just
thought<00:03:03.270> i'd<00:03:03.360> do<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.570> for<00:03:03.600> fun<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.140> as<00:03:04.560> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
thought i'd do it for fun and as a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.850 
thought i'd do it for fun and as a
concept<00:03:05.270> sort<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.360> thing<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.380> anyone<00:03:07.650> wants

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
concept sort of thing so if anyone wants

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.180 
concept sort of thing so if anyone wants
to<00:03:07.890> adapt<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.430> they<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:10.350> something<00:03:10.770> useful

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
to adapt it they can to something useful

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.110 
to adapt it they can to something useful
said<00:03:12.000> oh<00:03:13.280> yeah<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.520> needs<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:14.880> up

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
said oh yeah there needs to be one up

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.610 
said oh yeah there needs to be one up
there<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.510> can't<00:03:15.870> figure<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.620> my

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
there I can't figure out how to get my

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.449 
there I can't figure out how to get my
life<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.830> ruined<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.750> collect<00:03:22.110> some<00:03:22.320> sand<00:03:22.620> I'll

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
life is ruined to collect some sand I'll

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.630 
life is ruined to collect some sand I'll
explain<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:24.000> as<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.890> these<00:03:26.040> TNT's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
explain it as I go and so these TNT's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.580 
explain it as I go and so these TNT's
will<00:03:27.270> be<00:03:27.360> set<00:03:27.540> off<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.930> similar<00:03:28.230> fashion<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
will be set off in a similar fashion to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.740 
will be set off in a similar fashion to
the<00:03:28.680> old<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.790> without<00:03:29.970> having<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.480> start

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the old one but without having to start

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.380 
the old one but without having to start
a<00:03:30.900> new<00:03:31.110> circuit<00:03:32.120> I'll<00:03:33.120> show<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.390> why<00:03:33.480> me<00:03:35.030> so

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.300 

yes<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.590> set<00:03:39.830> up<00:03:39.980> yep<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.860> as<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.010> see

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
yes that is set up yep so as you see

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.660 
yes that is set up yep so as you see
these<00:03:43.850> are<00:03:44.030> all<00:03:44.120> on<00:03:44.590> there<00:03:45.590> all<00:03:45.740> activated<00:03:46.250> but

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
these are all on there all activated but

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.340 
these are all on there all activated but
oneself<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.910> what's<00:03:50.420> going<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.630> happen<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.140> I'm

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
oneself so what's going to happen is I'm

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.660 
oneself so what's going to happen is I'm
going<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.560> flick<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.860> on<00:03:52.010> which<00:03:52.550> will

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
going to flick that on which will

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.430 
going to flick that on which will
activate<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.120> circuit<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:53.720> blow<00:03:54.200> up<00:03:54.260> that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
activate this circuit and blow up that

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.530 
activate this circuit and blow up that
TD<00:03:54.890> I've<00:03:55.130> seen<00:03:55.490> before<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.090> that's<00:03:56.330> already

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
TD I've seen before but that's already

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.960 
TD I've seen before but that's already
been<00:03:56.690> doing<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.370> will<00:03:58.459> activate<00:03:58.700> this

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
been doing and it will activate this

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.330 
been doing and it will activate this
piston<00:03:59.510> which<00:03:59.900> will<00:04:00.140> clear<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:01.010> out<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.250> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
piston which will clear that out of the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.720 
piston which will clear that out of the
way<00:04:01.450> fling<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.480> over<00:04:02.660> there<00:04:02.930> somewhere<00:04:03.230> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
way fling it over there somewhere and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.300 
way fling it over there somewhere and
then<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:05.480> will<00:04:05.690> turn<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.170> which<00:04:06.920> will<00:04:07.190> then

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
then this will turn on which will then

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.280 
then this will turn on which will then
act<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.030> which<00:04:08.330> will<00:04:08.480> then<00:04:08.600> activate<00:04:09.140> all<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
act it which will then activate all the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.780 
act it which will then activate all the
circuits<00:04:09.650> doing<00:04:09.950> all<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.250> TNT<00:04:11.020> switches<00:04:12.020> off

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
circuits doing all the TNT switches off

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.349 
circuits doing all the TNT switches off
which<00:04:13.790> will<00:04:13.970> set<00:04:14.239> off<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.450> piston<00:04:14.900> which<00:04:15.830> will

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
which will set off the piston which will

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.270 
which will set off the piston which will
reactivate<00:04:17.359> all<00:04:17.720> those<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.410> settle<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
reactivate all those and settle that the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.550 
reactivate all those and settle that the
India<00:04:20.769> nicely<00:04:21.769> planned<00:04:22.270> ok<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
India nicely planned ok so this the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.800 
India nicely planned ok so this the
concept<00:04:24.919> is<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.640> can<00:04:25.790> use<00:04:26.000> pistons<00:04:26.570> to

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
concept is that you can use pistons to

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.530 
concept is that you can use pistons to
set<00:04:26.960> off<00:04:27.050> more<00:04:27.260> than<00:04:27.380> one<00:04:27.530> circuit<00:04:28.010> or<00:04:28.130> ones<00:04:28.540> so

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
set off more than one circuit or ones so

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.870 
set off more than one circuit or ones so
that<00:04:29.570> one's<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.140> separate<00:04:30.560> circuit<00:04:31.010> but<00:04:31.220> using

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
that one's a separate circuit but using

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.450 
that one's a separate circuit but using
the<00:04:31.970> Pistons<00:04:32.390> you<00:04:32.510> can<00:04:32.630> set<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.840> off<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:34.160> so

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
the Pistons you can set it off it so

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.120 
the Pistons you can set it off it so
that<00:04:34.669> seemed<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:34.940> work<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:36.680> didn't<00:04:36.980> blow

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
that seemed to work and that didn't blow

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.680 
that seemed to work and that didn't blow
up<00:04:37.480> why<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.540> not<00:04:38.870> blowing<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:40.510> why<00:04:41.510> are<00:04:41.570> you

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
up why you not blowing up why are you

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:50.020 
up why you not blowing up why are you
not<00:04:41.930> setting<00:04:42.290> off<00:04:42.380> ah<00:04:45.310> being<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.430> my<00:04:46.550> life<00:04:49.030> ok

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
not setting off ah being in my life ok

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.140 
not setting off ah being in my life ok
it's<00:04:50.150> your<00:04:50.240> on<00:04:51.400> if<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.580> are<00:04:52.760> off<00:04:54.669> why<00:04:55.669> you're

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
it's your on if you are off why you're
