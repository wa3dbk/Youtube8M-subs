00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:11.810
 Adult stem cells play a central role in human natural reproduction systems 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.309
 When the discovery was made, many scientists were able to improve the human natural reproduction system 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.480
 Study more specifically how it affects optimal health 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.020
 I started 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.860
 Increases the release of adult stem cells from bone marrow. 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.510
 Ask a doctor if you need a large amount of adult stem cells to move around in the body 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:34.190
 It can improve the system of the organization and the organ of the human body by supporting 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:38.269
 Has been confirmed through extensive research 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.249
 In another study , the amount and quality of adult stem cells 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:47.030
 Decreases as you get older and as a result, responds to health problems related to aging 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.440
 The ability to respond to human body results in reduced results 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.559
 Confirmed 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:59.299
 Stress environment pollution Additional factors such as undesirable diet movement structure 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.109
 It also resulted in degrading the function of the body's natural regeneration systems such 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:08.390
 Based on open collaborative research plays an important role in maintaining human health 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:12.380
 Similar to cardiovascular and power , adult stem cells are regenerated through health foods 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:16.640
 Research has begun on how to maximize the process 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.780
 One scientific research team did not have job titles that offer a variety of health benefits 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.760
 The world's first research into plants 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.400
 The purpose of these plants and how the influence of physiologically functional human adult stem cells 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.170
 Was to confirm that 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 The extensive experimental results of the boy led the research team to an innovative discovery 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.360
 Millions in just a few minutes by taking advantage of the gift of a very powerful and concentrated aquatic plants 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.530
 The dog release the adult stem cells being able to ensure circulation in the human body 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.390
 It was 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.970
 After many trials and studies in 2005, it was finally the first to provide stem cell nutrition 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.909
 The product was born in the United States 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.270
 Since then, there has been a complete and exclusive provision to support the circulation and migration of adult stem cells 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.990
 Adult stem cell nutrition products have been developed, and consumer product experiences and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.970
 Story 1 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 In a word, It was a miracle in itself stem cells ut Sean cattle billion dollars 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.859
 Always reaching and potentially powerful enough to neutralize the market 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.939
 And will be the world's best health food in the future 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:20.269
 StemTech, a company that values â€‹â€‹innovation, is the world's most amazing wellness 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:24.439
 As a leader of the revolution, I stand on the shoulder pioneer 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.889
 Stentek products change everyone's thinking about health and well-being 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.889
