tap<00:01:56.579> tempo<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> delay<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.250> was

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tap tempo or a delay and then there was

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
tap tempo or a delay and then there was
a<00:01:59.369> tap<00:01:59.640> tempo<00:02:00.020> off<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.290> my<00:02:01.350> boss<00:02:01.590> too<00:02:01.740> late<00:02:01.890> now

this is a for me this is this all in one

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
this is a for me this is this all in one
little<00:02:04.430> thing<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> tap<00:02:06.630> tempo

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
little thing so if I want to tap tempo

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.419 
little thing so if I want to tap tempo
which<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.200> use<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> delay<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.250> play

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
which I use a lot of delay if I play

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.110 
which I use a lot of delay if I play
electric<00:02:08.700> guitar<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.060> somebody<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
electric guitar for somebody and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.020 
electric guitar for somebody and
because<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.959> just<00:02:11.989> do<00:02:12.230> some<00:02:12.440> sweet<00:02:13.030> sounds

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
because I can just do some sweet sounds

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.369 
because I can just do some sweet sounds
it<00:02:14.120> adds<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> music<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.019> doesn't

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
it adds to the music but doesn't

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.110 
it adds to the music but doesn't
distract<00:02:15.950> from<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.400> words<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.879> after

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
distract from the words and after

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.330 
distract from the words and after
worship<00:02:17.420> music<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.019> words<00:02:18.230> are<00:02:18.560> about

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
worship music so the words are about

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.740 
worship music so the words are about
Jesus<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:19.970> that's<00:02:20.120> what<00:02:20.239> matters

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Jesus and that's what matters

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:30.100 
Jesus and that's what matters
so<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> delay<00:02:25.870> TAFTA<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.940> always<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.049> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
so that delay TAFTA I always have a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.449 
so that delay TAFTA I always have a
little<00:02:30.349> bit<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.560> delay<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:31.069> on<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> really

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
little bit of delay going on a really

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.250 
little bit of delay going on a really
fast<00:02:31.670> tap<00:02:31.910> even<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.360> play<00:02:32.569> anything<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.110> here

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
fast tap even if I play anything so here

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:48.860 
fast tap even if I play anything so here
are<00:02:33.319> some<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> different<00:02:33.799> sounds<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.199 

can<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.960> can<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.170> leave<00:02:50.410> that

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:14.490 

or<00:02:56.209> delay<00:02:57.010> there's<00:02:58.010> always<00:02:58.159> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.519> delay

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.240 

you're<00:03:15.500> saying<00:03:15.740> with<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.130> more

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
you're saying with a little more

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.120 
Distortion
or<00:03:18.220> delay<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> one<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:24.130> driven

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
or delay I get to one of the driven

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
or delay I get to one of the driven
channel<00:03:25.460> again<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.510> lots<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.750> delay<00:03:28.060> cuz<00:03:29.060> I

channel again with lots of delay cuz I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:40.050 
channel again with lots of delay cuz I
like

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.280 

Oh

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.059 

it's<00:03:45.290> not<00:03:45.440> even<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.720> guess<00:03:47.720> maybe<00:03:48.349> 1/4<00:03:48.830> of

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
it's not even that I guess maybe 1/4 of

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.800 
it's not even that I guess maybe 1/4 of
what<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.400> can<00:03:49.550> do<00:03:49.700> maybe<00:03:50.060> 1/10<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.540> what<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.720> can

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
what it can do maybe 1/10 of what I can

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:18.210 
what it can do maybe 1/10 of what I can
do<00:03:50.959> right<00:03:50.989> now

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.860 

that's<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.430> it's<00:04:19.580> got<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.760> good<00:04:20.390> clean<00:04:20.600> town

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
that's it it's got a good clean town

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.140 
that's it it's got a good clean town
it's<00:04:21.140> got<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.320> great<00:04:21.650> delay<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.850> got<00:04:23.030> your

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
it's got a great delay it's got your

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.700 
it's got a great delay it's got your
little<00:04:23.420> pedal<00:04:23.630> board<00:04:23.810> mixed<00:04:24.110> in<00:04:24.200> if<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.470> spend

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
little pedal board mixed in if you spend

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.620 
little pedal board mixed in if you spend
a<00:04:24.770> lot<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:24.950> time<00:04:25.190> with<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.430> amp<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.820> can<00:04:26.330> I've

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
a lot of time with the amp you can I've

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.630 
a lot of time with the amp you can I've
just<00:04:26.900> got<00:04:27.200> my<00:04:27.230> four<00:04:27.620> or<00:04:27.710> five<00:04:27.860> favorite<00:04:28.250> sounds

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
just got my four or five favorite sounds

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.670 
just got my four or five favorite sounds
and<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.570> can<00:04:29.750> switch<00:04:29.990> between<00:04:30.140> them<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> only

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
and I can switch between them the only

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.550 
and I can switch between them the only
hard<00:04:30.920> part<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:32.360> switching<00:04:32.870> between<00:04:33.110> them<00:04:33.410> is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
hard part in switching between them is

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.810 
hard part in switching between them is
you<00:04:33.680> really<00:04:33.860> have<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.130> spend<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.400> lot<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.550> time

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
you really have to spend a lot of time

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.090 
you really have to spend a lot of time
between<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.450> master<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.110> power<00:04:36.140> level<00:04:36.710> they

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
between the master the power level they

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.940 
between the master the power level they
gain<00:04:37.340> in<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> volume<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.210> get<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.390> good<00:04:38.600> mix

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
gain in the volume to get a good mix

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.530 
gain in the volume to get a good mix
from<00:04:39.950> one<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.400> other<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:40.940> saw<00:04:41.360> that

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
from one to the other and you saw that

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.840 
from one to the other and you saw that
one<00:04:41.720> was<00:04:41.870> really<00:04:42.110> loud<00:04:42.260> one<00:04:43.160> was<00:04:43.370> really<00:04:43.640> low

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
one was really loud one was really low

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.450 
one was really loud one was really low
so<00:04:44.150> it'll<00:04:44.300> take<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:44.660> hours<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.650> program<00:04:46.310> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
so it'll take you hours to program it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.460 
so it'll take you hours to program it
the<00:04:46.670> way<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.510> need<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.080> use<00:04:48.170> it<00:04:48.200> live

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
the way that you need to to use it live

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.560 
the way that you need to to use it live
but<00:04:49.220> it's<00:04:49.370> quiet<00:04:49.610> enough<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.240> record

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
but it's quiet enough you can record

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.090 
but it's quiet enough you can record
with<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.050> can<00:04:51.200> get<00:04:51.320> any<00:04:51.500> sound<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.860> want

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
with it you can get any sound you want

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.990 
with it you can get any sound you want
it<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.490> want<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:53.140> add<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.200> recording<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.000> it's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
it you want to add a recording and it's

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.250 
it you want to add a recording and it's
just<00:04:56.150> really<00:04:56.300> good<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.810> can't<00:04:57.020> beat<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.200> for

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
just really good you can't beat it for
