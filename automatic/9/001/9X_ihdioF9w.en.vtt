00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.920
 - Hello everyone and welcome much warmer 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
 new tutorial percent tutto fellini 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.519
 so today he understands 16 years 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.099
 why I'm no less than 33 years old the group is 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.439
 Freche 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.030
 we thus find recourse against a valve they count more 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.519
 for my part 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.979
 but both players appear here and here 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:34.010
 here and so the beginning the golden goal of Laura actually is that they send me or 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.480
 three 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.030
 none directly 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.490
 ambitions 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.490
 for the chance to improve and get to our opponent 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.210
 at the moment when it is still very long 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.440
 we would get 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650
 and then right now 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 building finished in this ilan impact timing 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 so read account 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.830
 your words 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.830
 so it's important to have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 150 of wood at the time when the three who distinguished 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.750
 his plan because 150 of wood is what we need to improve 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450
 three rounds so 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 to stop his attacks 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 during the tour ends 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.579
 m here is south stream that crack Alexis retreat 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.880
 so we find in the 252 euros this amount but as I could see me 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 say that and revive its role in this market development 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 but logically 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.010
 he should go out a little before but everything ends 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 or that it is imperative to keep the three peru simply because 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.820
 this is what will you 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.400
 repair the towers 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.680
 and therefore certainly the right on the market 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 so a promising market 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.630
 so she 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 we leave immediately companion 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.639
 more beautiful 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.639
 - and where I spend on the most immediately 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.019
 to try to keep alive what obviously heaven falls this term of 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.269
 group 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.269
 you repair did not want to be spotted 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.089
 the 73rd 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.039
 you want even the smallest coc sales it's very long 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 technical humala works very well 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.269
 so after this movement that is launched obviously 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.399
 stabilized and you could be dismissed the match lack of resources 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.929
 while solutions from the opponent wins my reset button place his 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:58.519
 head and Shiites 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.939
 that's why do not hesitate 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.029
 do not hesitate to consult the websitewww to defend yourself 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.919
 you said 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.619
 it's still so com 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.979
 it therefore guarantees 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
 we can not 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.899
 other dance words 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 it's too much 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.179
 more considering the little 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.479
 the warning shot 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.359
 ole totally from his base 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.369
 for a child you understood there is a pure 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.019
 thomas bach who is placed 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.019
 so we can doubt group 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.749
 on the menu of a mouth he does not work with me 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.799
 but here we find a lot of compliments 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.939
 or worse 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.519
 we assume the victory that is cornered we learned that the mayor 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:05.490
 So here is 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.490
 % and I believe we simply because 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.599
 for all scholarships the journalist of France 2 a couple 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.120
 this year 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 for the rest 10% and many other appointments tutorial 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.529
 and for 100 th thank you 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.119
