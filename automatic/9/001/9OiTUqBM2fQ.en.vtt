00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
right path so mess around with a little

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.890 
right path so mess around with a little
bit<00:02:17.690> try<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.959> go<00:02:18.140> random<00:02:18.860> places<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.810> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
bit try to go random places and when you

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.670 
have to use the bloodlust war so you
have<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.450> get<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.720> unlocked<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:02.439> then<00:03:02.530> it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
have to get that unlocked and then it

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.879 
have to get that unlocked and then it
unlocks<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.400> blue<00:03:04.030> orb<00:03:04.319> then<00:03:05.319> again<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.769> have

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
unlocks the blue orb then again you have

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.399 
unlocks the blue orb then again you have
to<00:03:05.950> find<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.609> way<00:03:06.730> back<00:03:06.970> through<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.930> a

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
to find your way back through it and a

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.409 
to find your way back through it and a
good<00:03:08.590> way<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.950> follow<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.790> where<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> orb

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
good way is follow the where the orb

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:21.730 
good way is follow the where the orb
goes<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.290> usually<00:03:11.560> leads<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:12.159> path

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.560 

and<00:03:22.310> there's<00:03:22.490> a<00:03:22.610> treasure<00:03:22.910> chest<00:03:23.060> right<00:03:23.540> here

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
and there's a treasure chest right here

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
I already open it that's not the diet

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.490 
I already open it that's not the diet
daiichi<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.400> really<00:03:28.850> good<00:03:29.230> argument<00:03:30.230> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
daiichi it's a really good argument that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.230 
daiichi it's a really good argument that
you<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:30.860> get<00:03:30.980> for<00:03:31.760> your<00:03:31.850> weapons<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:33.850> go<00:03:34.850> back

you<00:03:41.900> open<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.680> get<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.890> Daiichi<00:03:43.100> um<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:45.500> have

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
you open to get the Daiichi um you have

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.610 
you open to get the Daiichi um you have
to<00:03:45.830> kind<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.220> already<00:03:46.490> know<00:03:47.230> unless<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.440> just

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
to kind of already know unless you just

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.970 
to kind of already know unless you just
explore<00:03:50.560> each<00:03:51.560> afta<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:54.110> looks<00:03:54.410> normal

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
explore each afta it just looks normal

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.680 
explore each afta it just looks normal
looks<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.640> there<00:03:55.790> would<00:03:55.970> be<00:03:56.030> nothing<00:03:56.330> there

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
looks like there would be nothing there

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.360 
looks like there would be nothing there
but<00:03:57.350> that's<00:03:57.590> actually<00:03:57.770> where<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.160> get<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
but that's actually where you get the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.670 
but that's actually where you get the
Daiichi<00:03:58.580> I<00:04:01.330> just<00:04:02.330> explored<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.470> found

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
Daiichi I just explored and I just found

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.170 
Daiichi I just explored and I just found
the<00:04:03.860> treasure<00:04:04.040> chest<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.610> I<00:04:04.640> opened<00:04:05.090> it
