to<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> wheel<00:03:12.030> looks<00:03:13.030> very<00:03:13.330> well<00:03:13.540> packaged

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
to the wheel looks very well packaged

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.270 
to the wheel looks very well packaged
got<00:03:15.970> an<00:03:16.090> instruction<00:03:16.840> booklet<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.350> don't<00:03:18.190> know

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
got an instruction booklet I don't know

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.270 
got an instruction booklet I don't know
why<00:03:18.510> looks<00:03:19.510> pretty<00:03:20.080> much<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.680> same<00:03:20.830> thing<00:03:21.190> as

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
why looks pretty much the same thing as

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280 
why looks pretty much the same thing as
this<00:03:21.459> without<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.420> didn't<00:03:22.660> have<00:03:22.750> any<00:03:22.930> second

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
this without that didn't have any second

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.979 
this without that didn't have any second
of<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:28.750> one<00:03:29.040> looks<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.190> little<00:03:30.370> nicer

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
of it this one looks a little nicer

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.229 
of it this one looks a little nicer
cause<00:03:32.610> it's<00:03:34.290> actually<00:03:35.290> made<00:03:35.470> by<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
cause it's actually made by we and the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.039 
cause it's actually made by we and the
difference<00:03:37.660> here<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.989> has

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
difference here as you can see this has

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.990 
difference here as you can see this has
a<00:03:41.260> B<00:03:41.620> button<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.040> because<00:03:42.459> when<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.850> look

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
a B button on it because when you look

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.720 
a B button on it because when you look
at<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.209> wii<00:03:43.329> remote<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:45.160> got<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:45.549> right

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
right here and then I try it off for

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.330 
right here and then I try it off for
this<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:56.170> will<00:03:56.350> still<00:03:56.620> do<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.829> same<00:03:57.040> thing<00:03:57.310> but

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
this it will still do the same thing but

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.360
