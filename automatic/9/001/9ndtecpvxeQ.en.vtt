this<00:02:47.170> coin<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.489> really<00:02:48.730> really<00:02:49.000> special

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
this coin this is really really special

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.789 
this coin this is really really special
especially<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.170> there's<00:02:50.380> only<00:02:50.470> five

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
especially that there's only five

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.080 
especially that there's only five
hundred<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.430> made<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.940> thought<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.959> was<00:02:53.170> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
hundred of a made I thought that was a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.600 
hundred of a made I thought that was a
pretty<00:02:55.090> good<00:02:55.390> deal<00:02:55.739> even<00:02:56.739> though<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.920> was<00:02:57.069> 500

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
pretty good deal even though it was 500

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.960 
pretty good deal even though it was 500
hours<00:02:57.849> more<00:02:58.090> than<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.200> other<00:02:59.410> regular<00:02:59.970> coin

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
hours more than the other regular coin

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.440 
hours more than the other regular coin
the<00:03:01.840> kilo<00:03:02.200> coin<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> low<00:03:03.700> mintage<00:03:03.940> I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the kilo coin but the low mintage I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.660 
the kilo coin but the low mintage I
figured<00:03:05.320> it'll<00:03:05.590> definitely<00:03:05.829> will<00:03:06.190> pay<00:03:06.430> off

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
figured it'll definitely will pay off

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.840 
figured it'll definitely will pay off
for<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> price<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.410> there's<00:03:09.280> no<00:03:09.400> question

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
for the price of it there's no question

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.590 
for the price of it there's no question
about<00:03:09.910> that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
about that

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.900 
about that

probably most likely so your fingertips

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.809 
probably most likely so your fingertips
don't<00:03:40.389> go<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> capsule<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.549> plenty
