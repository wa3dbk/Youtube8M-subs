so<00:04:44.360> if<00:04:44.600> I<00:04:44.840> was<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.050> write<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.410> game<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.770> would

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
so if I was to write the game I would

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.960 
so if I was to write the game I would
give<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> nice<00:04:46.900> 7<00:04:47.900> on<00:04:48.050> 10<00:04:48.380> because<00:04:49.310> the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
give it a nice 7 on 10 because the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.650 
give it a nice 7 on 10 because the
players<00:04:50.479> are<00:04:50.750> imbalanced<00:04:51.110> as<00:04:51.919> we<00:04:52.130> can<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:52.660> my

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
players are imbalanced as we can see my

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.600 
players are imbalanced as we can see my
player<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:54.139> too<00:04:54.380> slow<00:04:54.620> compared<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.130> seguida

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
player is too slow compared to seguida

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.480 
player is too slow compared to seguida
and<00:04:55.880> that's<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.740> balancing<00:04:57.740> issues<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:58.340> know

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
and that's the balancing issues you know

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.340 
and that's the balancing issues you know
it's<00:04:58.820> like<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.150> end<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.389> 3<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.870> end<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.110> three

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
it's like the end of 3 the end of three

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.879 
it's like the end of 3 the end of three
years

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
years

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.439 
years
there's<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.280> class<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:01.880> better<00:05:02.090> than<00:05:02.300> all
