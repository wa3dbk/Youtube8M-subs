00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
didn't think much of it so I went out

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.560 
didn't think much of it so I went out
there<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:27.829> in<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.669> video<00:00:28.759> you'll<00:00:29.089> see<00:00:29.240> I<00:00:29.269> get

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
there and in the video you'll see I get

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.380 
there and in the video you'll see I get
out<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.869> water<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.169> everything<00:00:30.410> well<00:00:30.710> I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
out in the water and everything well I

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.910 
out in the water and everything well I
could<00:00:32.390> see<00:00:32.660> across<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.230> lake<00:00:33.590> because<00:00:33.739> it's<00:00:33.829> a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
could see across the lake because it's a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.830 
could see across the lake because it's a
big<00:00:34.100> lake<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:34.489> like<00:00:34.610> 7,000<00:00:35.210> acres<00:00:35.539> you<00:00:35.690> could

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
big lake it's like 7,000 acres you could

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.020 
big lake it's like 7,000 acres you could
see<00:00:36.050> like<00:00:36.289> a<00:00:36.320> wall<00:00:36.649> of<00:00:36.890> snow<00:00:37.100> coming<00:00:37.610> which<00:00:37.760> was

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
see like a wall of snow coming which was

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.910 
see like a wall of snow coming which was
the<00:00:38.210> wind<00:00:38.449> and<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.199> thought<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.559> would<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:39.680> be

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
the wind and I thought it would just be

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.040 
the wind and I thought it would just be
a<00:00:40.039> gust<00:00:40.399> coming<00:00:40.789> through<00:00:41.030> but<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.449> didn't<00:00:41.930> think

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
a gust coming through but I didn't think

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.670 
a gust coming through but I didn't think
much<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.320> it

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
much of it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.650 
much of it
so<00:00:42.829> anyway<00:00:43.129> you'll<00:00:43.730> see<00:00:43.879> me<00:00:44.000> getting<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.510> fish

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
so anyway you'll see me getting the fish

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.049 
so anyway you'll see me getting the fish
house<00:00:44.870> out<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.129> everything<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.609> then<00:00:46.730> I<00:00:46.820> I

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
house out and everything and then I I

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.689 
house out and everything and then I I
start<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.199> set<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:48.530> up<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.980> see<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.370> clip

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
start to set it up you see that clip

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.970 
start to set it up you see that clip
well<00:00:50.210> then<00:00:50.329> I<00:00:50.359> switched<00:00:51.050> clips<00:00:51.469> I<00:00:51.739> was<00:00:51.859> gonna

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
well then I switched clips I was gonna

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.770 
well then I switched clips I was gonna
actually<00:00:52.370> go<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> other<00:00:53.059> side<00:00:53.359> and<00:00:53.539> set<00:00:53.690> it

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
actually go on the other side and set it

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.810 
actually go on the other side and set it
up<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.260> wind<00:00:54.620> came<00:00:54.949> first<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.429> all<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.579> blew

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
up that wind came first of all I blew

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.250 
up that wind came first of all I blew
the<00:00:55.940> camera<00:00:56.269> over<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.660> they<00:00:56.750> ruined<00:00:57.079> that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
the camera over and they ruined that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.639 
the camera over and they ruined that
clip<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.590> clip<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.519> won't<00:00:58.850> read<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.649> with

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
clip that clip it won't read it and with

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.229 
clip that clip it won't read it and with
me<00:01:00.829> in<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.070> fish<00:01:01.250> house<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.760> just<00:01:01.969> started

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
me in the fish house it just started

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.750 
me in the fish house it just started
blowing<00:01:02.539> meeting<00:01:03.109> across<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.829> lake<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.460> I

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
blowing meeting across the lake so I

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.640 
blowing meeting across the lake so I
couldn't<00:01:05.660> even<00:01:05.810> get<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.020> fish<00:01:06.200> sauce<00:01:06.380> up<00:01:06.530> I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
couldn't even get that fish sauce up I

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.900 
couldn't even get that fish sauce up I
thought<00:01:06.830> maybe<00:01:06.980> that<00:01:07.100> gust<00:01:07.490> would<00:01:07.640> come

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
thought maybe that gust would come
