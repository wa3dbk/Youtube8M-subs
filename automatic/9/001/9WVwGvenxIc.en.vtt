start<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:31.859> 80<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.219> animal<00:00:32.579> facility<00:00:32.940> has

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
start with 80 the animal facility has

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.740 
start with 80 the animal facility has
been<00:00:33.270> built<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.260> -<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.860> -<00:00:35.040> around<00:00:35.610> our<00:00:36.030> house<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
been built on - in - around our house I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
been built on - in - around our house I
guess<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
guess and then we do have some of the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
guess and then we do have some of the
animals<00:00:39.090> outside<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.110> partially

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
animals outside and some are partially

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.850 
animals outside and some are partially
housed<00:00:41.129> inside<00:00:41.460> outside<00:00:42.410> most<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
housed inside outside most of the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
housed inside outside most of the
animals<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.610> tropical<00:00:45.030> species<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.750> they

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
animals are tropical species so they

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
animals are tropical species so they
have<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> inside<00:00:46.410> temperature<00:00:46.860> controlled

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have to be inside temperature controlled

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.549 
have to be inside temperature controlled
but<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.210> small<00:00:48.660> reptiles<00:00:49.050> or

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
but there are really small reptiles or

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.209 
but there are really small reptiles or
birds<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.870> we<00:00:51.870> started<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.260> 30<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> then

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
birds so we started with 30 and then

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.340 
birds so we started with 30 and then
we've<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.850> expanded<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.539> fit<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> ones<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we've just expanded to fit the ones that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.479 
we've just expanded to fit the ones that
need<00:00:55.949> housing

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
need housing
