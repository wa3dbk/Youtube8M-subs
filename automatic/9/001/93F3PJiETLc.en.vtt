00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello to all of us we find ourselves 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.480
 for the tutorial of how to change a wheel 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.570
 of freestyle scooters so for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 start will have to unscrew the wheel 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.760
 so take here m uncle and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.390
 two on each side 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:28.460
 that's it's a key on the other side as 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.460
 that I asked myself the scooter like that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 impose like that you would unscrew 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.579
 the wheels like that you're going to hold with 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:48.559
 7.7 key you will hold like that with 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.559
 the other one you go to and this is it 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 you would unscrew I want you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:17.070
 have screw can not do it yet 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:28.799
 by hand we are well and life is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:30.030
 as it should be like that here we can 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.070
 to be careful because it's good 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.820
 greasy for you that you can the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 view it can be put back full 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 so that's after you have a track 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 like that and for the novice yet 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.000
 dax you're going to put your key like this 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 and you will push his thrusts like 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.979
 this is to bring out the ex you are here 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.490
 the other axis so that you have that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.040
 an axis and the other a screw which turns 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.159
 in and who say they are here after 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.360
 you go to whom you will remove the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.759
 wheel and you'll have a wheel like that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.440
 that's with the bearings of in 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.420
 the attic all that is why he 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.420
 remove the wheel 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.099
 to change the novels so here we have 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.690
 saw this wheel so I'm going to take 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.940
 another one or that's the same as I 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.860
 will change and you will put it 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.880
 in well as it takes 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.350
 you will take with your key 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.130
 try to find access 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.470
 the middle and you'll go between the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.560
 the athlete she holds as if it was this 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.290
 axis that is between your wheel and 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.180
 then it passes through the fork of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.670
 you have found the middle red 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.780
 where she is beautiful wait i'm going 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.650
 turn the wheel which in my opinion I have a 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.650
 little fork problem 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.569
 once you've found 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.670
 the acce you're going to put this axis in 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:08.650
 that excuse me I moved the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.319
 camera you m site in the access 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.370
 in so it's hard enough to find 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.260
 the middle there and you're going to tap in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.989
 so like that I put my axis here 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.880
 otherwise my axis here I still have 7 screws to m 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:34.180
 like that here you are life is where 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.180
 start with the indexed by hand 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.500
 like that 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.400
 as soon as you can no longer love you 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:51.130
 take your two keys and you live and not 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:04:00.050
 the age of davis and you life is like that 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:06.970
 I galley a little tech here you aim 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:09.020
 well at max and there you remove your keys 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.090
 and you have a new wheel then 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.470
 thank you for watching this video and 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.470
 good luck to you know
