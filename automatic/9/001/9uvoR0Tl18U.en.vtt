right<00:03:20.900> here<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.080> saw<00:03:21.320> these<00:03:21.470> three<00:03:21.739> guys<00:03:21.920> I

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
right here I saw these three guys I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.280 
right here I saw these three guys I
sneaked<00:03:22.550> in<00:03:22.700> here<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.480> lined<00:03:23.810> them<00:03:23.900> up<00:03:24.050> for

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
sneaked in here and I lined them up for

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.460 
sneaked in here and I lined them up for
like<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> triple<00:03:25.480> collateral<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:26.840> one<00:03:27.320> of<00:03:27.410> my

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
like a triple collateral but one of my

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.930 
like a triple collateral but one of my
teammates<00:03:27.709> came<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.220> there<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.520> wasn't<00:03:28.760> going

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
teammates came in there I wasn't going

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.400 
teammates came in there I wasn't going
to<00:03:29.000> get<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.270> anyways<00:03:29.570> because<00:03:29.780> other<00:03:30.080> guy<00:03:30.260> had

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
to get it anyways because other guy had

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.610 
to get it anyways because other guy had
moved<00:03:30.709> at<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.220> last<00:03:31.340> minute<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.170> my<00:03:33.170> teammate

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
moved at the last minute and my teammate

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.070 
moved at the last minute and my teammate
had<00:03:33.830> killed<00:03:34.100> him<00:03:34.250> anyway<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.840> probably

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
had killed him anyway so it probably

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.370 
had killed him anyway so it probably
could<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:36.320> been<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.500> triple<00:03:36.830> kill<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.720> had

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
could have been a triple kill but I had

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
but he must be working out he's got that

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.480 
but he must be working out he's got that
tight<00:04:58.360> ass<00:04:59.580> so<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.590> sniper<00:05:02.890> over<00:05:03.340> the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
tight ass so I like the sniper over the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.910 
tight ass so I like the sniper over the
other<00:05:03.730> snipers<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.270> was<00:05:04.420> using<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.870> DSR<00:05:05.530> I

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
other snipers I was using the DSR I

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.920 
other snipers I was using the DSR I
think<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:06.550> called<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.790> dsr-50<00:05:07.420> or<00:05:07.780> some

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
think it's called the dsr-50 or some

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.140 
think it's called the dsr-50 or some
shit<00:05:08.110> like<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.590> was<00:05:09.190> using<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.490> one<00:05:09.850> and

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
shit like that I was using that one and

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.620 
shit like that I was using that one and
it<00:05:10.780> just<00:05:10.990> seems<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.530> very<00:05:11.560> slow<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.610> i'm<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:13.090> DSN

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
it just seems a very slow and i'm a DSN

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.960 
it just seems a very slow and i'm a DSN
you're<00:05:13.810> trying<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.320> IDs<00:05:14.620> with<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.980> this<00:05:15.730> one's

you're trying to IDs with it this one's

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.430 
you're trying to IDs with it this one's
a<00:05:16.060> lot<00:05:16.210> faster<00:05:16.450> but<00:05:16.930> it's<00:05:17.050> kind<00:05:17.380> of

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
a lot faster but it's kind of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.130 
a lot faster but it's kind of
inconsistent<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.760> gets<00:05:19.060> me<00:05:19.330> way<00:05:19.690> more<00:05:19.720> hit

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
inconsistent it gets me way more hit

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.250 
inconsistent it gets me way more hit

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
the chest went out point-blank heels for

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.790 
the chest went out point-blank heels for
like<00:05:25.950> three<00:05:26.950> or<00:05:27.130> four<00:05:27.160> feet<00:05:27.460> away

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
like three or four feet away

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.040 
like three or four feet away
and<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:30.000> bullet<00:05:30.300> went<00:05:30.330> straight<00:05:30.539> through<00:05:30.780> his

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
and the bullet went straight through his

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.369 
and the bullet went straight through his
chest<00:05:31.379> and<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.940> just<00:05:33.479> counted<00:05:33.780> as<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> hip<00:05:34.139> mark

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379
