solar cooker that we're going to show

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.200 
solar cooker that we're going to show
you<00:00:09.179> guys<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> make<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.410> one<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:12.059> just

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
you guys how to make this one is just

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.629 
you guys how to make this one is just
one<00:00:12.420> example<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.900> how<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.080> can<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.309> as

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
one example of how you can do it so as

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.099 
one example of how you can do it so as
you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.880> see<00:00:14.969> we<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.719> tinfoil

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you can see we just have some tinfoil

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.849 
you can see we just have some tinfoil
here<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.190> two<00:00:17.400> boxes<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:19.350> this

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
here and we have two boxes and then this

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.540 
here and we have two boxes and then this
black<00:00:20.490> pot<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.240> black<00:00:22.080> absorbs<00:00:23.070> heat

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
black pot right here black absorbs heat

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.029 
black pot right here black absorbs heat
so<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.410> good<00:00:25.769> thing<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
so it's really a really good thing to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
so it's really a really good thing to
use<00:00:26.660> especially<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.750> you're<00:00:27.840> trying<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> like

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
use especially if you're trying to like

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
use especially if you're trying to like
boil<00:00:28.529> water<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.039> something<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
boil water or something like that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.000 
boil water or something like that
and<00:00:30.960> how<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.769> built<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:34.010> pretty

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and how we built this is actually pretty

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.450 
and how we built this is actually pretty
easy

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
easy

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.440 
easy
it's<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.829> Quaker<00:00:37.829> Oats<00:00:38.100> box<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.059> Domino's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's just Quaker Oats box and a Domino's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
it's just Quaker Oats box and a Domino's
Pizza<00:00:39.950> tape<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.160> together<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.120> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
Pizza tape them together kind of just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
Pizza tape them together kind of just
took<00:00:42.510> them<00:00:42.660> apart<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.110> bit<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
took them apart a little bit and then we

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
took them apart a little bit and then we
added<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.579> foil<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.739> basic

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
added this foil right here and the basic

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
added this foil right here and the basic
principle<00:00:47.940> behind<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:49.399> is<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> Sun

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
principle behind this is that the Sun

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
principle behind this is that the Sun
right<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.469> bounce<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.190> light

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
right here will bounce the light

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.439 
right here will bounce the light
reflects<00:00:54.510> off<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.370> comes<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reflects off of this comes up up off of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.680 
reflects off of this comes up up off of
this<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.550> reflects<00:00:59.550> into<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.120> pot<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
this and then reflects into this pot and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.450 
this and then reflects into this pot and
this<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.559> absorb<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.100> heat<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.140> can

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
this will absorb the heat and it can

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
this will absorb the heat and it can
boil<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.360> cook<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.409> do

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
boil water it can cook things you can do

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.429 
boil water it can cook things you can do
any<00:01:08.100> number<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.400> things<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> today<00:01:10.320> we're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
any number of things so today we're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.510 
any number of things so today we're
going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> show<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.340> really

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going to show you how to make a really

any type works and some scissors of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.840 
any type works and some scissors of
course<00:01:31.259> we're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.130> aluminum<00:01:32.640> foil

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
course we're going to use aluminum foil

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
course we're going to use aluminum foil
to<00:01:33.150> cover<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> inside<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> box<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to cover the inside of the box one

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
to cover the inside of the box one
important<00:01:35.520> thing<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> keep<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.060> mind<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
important thing to keep in mind is that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
important thing to keep in mind is that
aluminum<00:01:37.409> foil<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.159> sides<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
aluminum foil has two sides one is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.319 
aluminum foil has two sides one is
shinier<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.680> other<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.189> dull<00:01:41.460> now

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
shinier and the other is more dull now

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.969 
shinier and the other is more dull now
the<00:01:42.390> shinier<00:01:42.930> side<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> reflect<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the shinier side is going to reflect a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
the shinier side is going to reflect a
lot<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.399> light<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> make

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
lot more light so we're going to make

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.850 
lot more light so we're going to make
sure<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> shiny<00:01:46.500> side<00:01:46.829> facing

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
sure that we have the shiny side facing

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
sure that we have the shiny side facing
up<00:01:47.600> for<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> pieces<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.680> lay<00:01:49.829> down<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> all

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
up for all the pieces we lay down so all

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
up for all the pieces we lay down so all
you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.740> take<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.390> size<00:01:54.390> big<00:01:54.780> enough

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you have to do is take a size big enough

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.160 
you have to do is take a size big enough
for<00:01:55.049> wherever<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.680> putting<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.979> down

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:15.590 

and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:03.070> put<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:12.220> one<00:02:13.220> side<00:02:13.459> down

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and then put it on one side down

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:37.190 
and then put it on one side down

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.070 

so<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.099> idea<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> solar<00:02:38.849> cooker<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
so the idea of the solar cooker is that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.990 
so the idea of the solar cooker is that
the<00:02:40.170> light<00:02:40.380> coming<00:02:40.770> down<00:02:40.920> from<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.250> Sun<00:02:41.489> is

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the light coming down from the Sun is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
the light coming down from the Sun is
going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.270> bounce<00:02:42.450> around<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.140> end<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.770> in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
going to bounce around and end up in

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.820 
going to bounce around and end up in
your<00:02:44.310> pot<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> question<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.800> we

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
your pot so the question is how can we

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.220 
your pot so the question is how can we
get<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> most<00:02:47.459> light<00:02:47.790> into<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.690> pot<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.170> that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
get the most light into the pot and that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.559 
get the most light into the pot and that
has<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> lot<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.489> with<00:02:50.610> these<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.209> what

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
has a lot to do with these and what

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.740 
has a lot to do with these and what
angle<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.989> put<00:02:52.170> them<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.600> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
angle we put them at so if you have it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
angle we put them at so if you have it
completely<00:02:55.260> flat<00:02:55.470> then<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.220> lights<00:02:56.550> just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
completely flat then the lights just

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.120 
completely flat then the lights just
going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.030> bounce<00:02:57.150> back<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.980> that's<00:02:58.980> not

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
going to bounce back out and that's not

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.740 
going to bounce back out and that's not
going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> trap<00:02:59.550> any<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.270> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.630> them

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
going to trap any but if you have them

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.559 
going to trap any but if you have them
completely<00:03:01.290> up<00:03:01.440> then<00:03:02.250> light's<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.330> really

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
completely up then light's not really

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.170 
completely up then light's not really
going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> bounce<00:03:03.959> off<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.440> them<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.180> somewhere

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
going to bounce off of them so somewhere

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.839 
going to bounce off of them so somewhere
in<00:03:06.239> between<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.410> good<00:03:07.709> angle<00:03:07.890> because<00:03:08.670> then

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
in between is a good angle because then

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.520 
in between is a good angle because then
the<00:03:08.940> light<00:03:09.120> coming<00:03:09.360> from<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.050> will

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the light coming from up here will

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.699 
the light coming from up here will
bounce<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.370> towards<00:03:11.850> your<00:03:12.000> pot<00:03:12.709> that's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
bounce in and towards your pot that's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.259 
bounce in and towards your pot that's
the<00:03:13.890> last<00:03:14.040> bit<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> design<00:03:14.640> where<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:14.970> want<00:03:15.209> to

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
the last bit of design where you want to

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.770 
the last bit of design where you want to
use<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.420> piece<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.810> tape<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.290> hold<00:03:17.100> these<00:03:17.489> up

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
use a piece of tape to hold these up

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.890 
use a piece of tape to hold these up
with<00:03:18.780> each<00:03:18.900> other<00:03:19.160> at<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.220> pretty<00:03:20.459> good<00:03:20.580> angle

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.100
