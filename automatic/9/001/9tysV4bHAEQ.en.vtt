00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 Hi everyone, and there is a new university 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.779
 get good Alexander logins 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.779
 something is missing now we start and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 for a start a couple of interesting videos first 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.059
 number the most mystical goal which 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.500
 imaginable didn't happen he in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.500
 third division championship spain 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.940
 you ask and where is the goal and this 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.159
 in fact he was the chief judge not 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 Seeing the episode relied on the side 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.149
 and he apparently forgot contact lenses at home 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.149
 once again trace the trajectory of the ball 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.549
 the next video is not about the good form 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.509
 sports lead roles on it 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.509
 karate 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 somehow all casually reluctantly reluctantly 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.100
 jostling example lie but one of 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.860
 athletes decided to make a little 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.899
 diversity apparently contender in this 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.119
 moment something very sad I said and 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.590
 all knockout is probably the most original 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.590
 of those that I had to see 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.240
 it was the turn of another weird 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.310
 the sport will be announced in our program 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.930
 obtained if you mix in the usual 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.320
 big tennis is a bit claustrophobic 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.760
 Nastya 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.340
 limiting game space 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.470
 called this miracle of the rocket bol 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.690
 and plays with his rubberized sword and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.060
 racket shapes are close to triangular 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.920
 the game consists of two games up to 15 points 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.409
 and in case of a tie-break 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.330
 third party up to 11 points each 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.979
 only the falling can draw 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.140
 otherwise, filing rights 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 the ball passes to the opponent after the strike 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.250
 player can touch the walls as much 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.989
 any time but an opponent to save 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 him in the game must discourage him after 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.340
 single touch floor viewers 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.690
 barriers they really are on that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.530
 watch real masters of racquetball from 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.080

 Racquetball can be played in any room 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.489
 where there are four walls true if this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.510
 it is better to remove the room in the apartment 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.510
 all beating 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.980
 watch football at modern stadiums
