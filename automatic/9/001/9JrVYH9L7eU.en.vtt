00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.650
 Hello friends, today I am going to 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.759
 show them how to do a hairstyle with 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.759
 ribbons for girls 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.360
 well the first thing we are going to do is to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.190
 pick up the hair from the top 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.490
 leaving laterals and the back 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.619
 loose we can apply a little gel and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 we combed very well so that it does not go to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.560
 get tangled 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 we take the monkey with a little bit and what 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.090
 we buried the hook inside the callus 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 so you do not look very carefully and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.800
 we already have our sections on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.250
 next step is that with a needle 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.949
 Roma point is called this needle if it is a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 thick needle that does not have any kind of 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.870
 tip that can be dangerous to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
 handle it on the girl's head 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.159
 then we are going to thread the tape 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 inside the needle and we're going to cross it 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.859
 on the side next to the hair that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 We collected in a zig zag shape over 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.270
 below above below until 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.270
 that we get to the other extreme 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.340
 Now what we're going to do is we're going 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 to take a colored ribbon a little more 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 strong in this case because I'm going to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.869
 use that violet and we will pass it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.090
 again around the part that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 we picked up but we're going to move it to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 otherwise then we will be left to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.720
 make a zig zag shape 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.250
 let's take the pink ribbon that we 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.290
 it was the first time we passed it and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 we are going to return it to the other 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.780
 end of the same way being in zig 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.190
 zag up down up to down taking 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.190
 consider the other two tapes 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.780
 now we take the purple ribbon and we're going 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.760
 to pass in the same way over 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.710
 below above below 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380
 taking into account the three tapes 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.790
 previous we passed it to the other 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.790
 end and let go 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 well now that we have the tapes 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.849
 put what we are going to do is that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.349
 let's weave two braids on each side 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.690
 we are going to make three of these braids 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.920
 chains let's start on the one hand what 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.099
 what are we going to do is we comb 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.680
 we live the hair in three parts and 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.890
 we started to weave a normal braid of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.410
 three the basic but we're just going to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.690
 feed from the underside of the of the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.090
 that we have the hair and we're going to try 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.940
 to make it so stretched that we try to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.040
 hide a bit the dividing line of the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.019
 hair that we collected and the hair that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.950
 it was loose then we crossed we took 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.819
 we add the hair to the part that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.069
 is in the middle and we cross again and 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.769
 so we will continue to knit as 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.780
 that we get to the queue what we're going to 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.640
 to do is that with the tape the tape the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 we are going to collect between the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.930
 braid the piece of tape that was left 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.549
 we are going to pick it up and we will go 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.620
 weaving between the braid what is going to 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.620
 serve is to decorate more the hairstyle 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.490
 now we move to the next lateral and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.470
 we do exactly the same 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.810
 we take a piece of hair what 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.570
 we stretch it up we divide it into 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.240
 three parts and we started to weave one 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.310
 basic braid of 3 fed only in 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.430
 the bottom part 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.500
 remember that we are going to take the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.870
 the tapes to go rolling them in the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 braid and make us serve 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.500
 decor 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.060
 we continue weaving the braid until 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.420
 let's get to the queue 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.280
 and we will place the braid over by 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.760
 over the pigtail and we hold it with 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.760
 a hook 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.080
 here we have the result of our 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.539
 hairstyle for girls decorated with ribbon 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.709
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.709
 in a next video
