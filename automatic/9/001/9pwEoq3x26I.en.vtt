00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
all the knots out which will make the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.339 
all the knots out which will make the
upcoming<00:00:22.769> process<00:00:23.279> way<00:00:23.789> easier<00:00:30.260> then<00:00:31.260> I'm

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
upcoming process way easier then I'm

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870 
upcoming process way easier then I'm
going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.590> taking<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.980> crappy<00:00:32.460> what's<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
going to be taking this crappy what's a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.069 
going to be taking this crappy what's a
straight<00:00:33.120> straightener<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.899> thought

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
straight straightener because I thought

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.620 
straight straightener because I thought
I<00:00:34.110> left<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.610> new<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.239> dad's<00:00:36.420> house

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I left my new one at my dad's house

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.000 
I left my new one at my dad's house
which<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> didn't<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.500> oh<00:00:37.530> well

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
which I didn't but oh well

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.240 
which I didn't but oh well
and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.879> I'm<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.180> sectioning<00:00:39.780> off<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
and then I'm just sectioning off the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.680 
and then I'm just sectioning off the
bottom<00:00:41.250> layer<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.670> hair<00:00:41.879> similar<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
bottom layer of my hair similar to the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
bottom layer of my hair similar to the
way<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:43.050> section<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.010> hair<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
way I would section off my hair if I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.750 
way I would section off my hair if I
were<00:00:44.640> straining<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> whole<00:00:45.270> thing

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.090 

now<00:00:52.760> I'm<00:00:53.030> taking<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.450> job<00:00:53.720> clip<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.590> secure<00:00:54.770> that

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
now I'm taking a job clip to secure that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.410 
now I'm taking a job clip to secure that
but<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.310> think<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:55.880> easier<00:00:56.180> than<00:00:56.210> using

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
but I think this is easier than using

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.740 
but I think this is easier than using
hair<00:00:56.750> tie<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.850> all<00:00:58.970> getting<00:00:59.210> all<00:00:59.300> up<00:00:59.540> close

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
hair tie and I all getting all up close

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.690 
hair tie and I all getting all up close
and<00:00:59.960> personal<00:01:00.350> I'm<00:01:00.620> just<00:01:01.070> taking<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.490> piece

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
and personal I'm just taking a piece

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.880 
and personal I'm just taking a piece
that<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:01.910> already<00:01:02.060> fixed<00:01:02.960> moving<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
that I already fixed moving it to the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.170 
that I already fixed moving it to the
other<00:01:03.980> side<00:01:04.130> and<00:01:04.489> clipping<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:04.880> out<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.090> the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
other side and clipping it out of the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.050 
other side and clipping it out of the
way<00:01:05.680> grabbing<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.830> new<00:01:06.980> piece<00:01:07.250> which<00:01:07.730> I'm<00:01:07.880> going

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
way grabbing a new piece which I'm going

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.670 
way grabbing a new piece which I'm going
to<00:01:08.120> brush<00:01:08.300> out<00:01:08.480> again<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.380> make<00:01:09.410> sure

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
to brush out again just to make sure

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.390 
to brush out again just to make sure
it's<00:01:09.830> as<00:01:10.040> smooth<00:01:10.370> as<00:01:10.550> possible<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:12.160> then<00:01:13.160> if<00:01:13.310> I

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
it's as smooth as possible and then if I

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.590 
it's as smooth as possible and then if I
were<00:01:13.520> straining<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.970> whole<00:01:14.150> thing<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.450> would

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
were straining the whole thing I would

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.969 
were straining the whole thing I would
try<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.810> use<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.080> chase<00:01:15.320> method<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:15.800> since

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
try to use the chase method but since

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.590 
try to use the chase method but since
I'm<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.520> going<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.790> be<00:01:16.940> touching<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.360> roots

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
I'm just going to be touching the roots

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.560 
I'm just going to be touching the roots
I<00:01:18.190> just<00:01:19.190> go<00:01:19.460> over<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.760> with<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.060> platter<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.510> I

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
I just go over it with the platter and I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.080 
I just go over it with the platter and I
don't<00:01:20.780> lose<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.860> chase<00:01:22.040> method<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:22.910> kind

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
don't lose the chase method so it's kind

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.420 
don't lose the chase method so it's kind
of<00:01:23.119> hard<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.360> tell<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:23.840> I'm<00:01:23.960> not<00:01:24.200> holding<00:01:25.130> the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
of hard to tell but I'm not holding the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.730 
of hard to tell but I'm not holding the
strainer<00:01:25.729> all<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.510> way<00:01:26.630> down<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:27.500> piece

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
strainer all the way down that piece

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.370 
strainer all the way down that piece
pared<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.490> half<00:01:29.270> way<00:01:29.509> or<00:01:29.540> less<00:01:29.840> just<00:01:30.140> enough

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
pared just half way or less just enough

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.800 
pared just half way or less just enough
to<00:01:30.530> get<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.890> parts<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.790> were<00:01:31.970> wavy<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.509> keep

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
to get the parts that were wavy and keep

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.390 
to get the parts that were wavy and keep
in<00:01:32.960> mind<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.380> my<00:01:33.470> hair<00:01:33.619> is<00:01:33.710> dry<00:01:33.890> when<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.190> did

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
in mind that my hair is dry when I did

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.180 
in mind that my hair is dry when I did
this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
this

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.700 
this
you<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:37.340> also<00:01:37.520> blow-dry<00:01:38.450> your<00:01:38.570> hair<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.290> just

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
you can also blow-dry your hair but just

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.760 
you can also blow-dry your hair but just
do<00:01:40.070> not<00:01:40.220> strain<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.910> when<00:01:41.750> it's<00:01:41.900> wet<00:01:42.080> with<00:01:42.590> your

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
do not strain it when it's wet with your

00:01:42.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
do not strain it when it's wet with your
sweat

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.060 

so<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.110> what<00:02:11.200> my<00:02:11.320> hair<00:02:11.440> looks<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.740> after

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
so this is what my hair looks like after

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.280 
so this is what my hair looks like after
I<00:02:12.250> did<00:02:12.520> repeated<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.390> process<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.990> all<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
I did repeated that process and all the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.650 
I did repeated that process and all the
sections<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.880> lot<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.060> volume<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.600> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
sections it's got a lot of volume at the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
sections it's got a lot of volume at the
bottom<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.830> now<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.070> roots<00:02:18.520> are

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
bottom but now the roots are

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.160 
bottom but now the roots are
straightened<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.660> kind<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.870> difficult

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
straightened and it's kind of difficult

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.150

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.100 

it<00:04:58.340> has<00:04:58.639> way<00:04:59.060> more<00:04:59.090> volume<00:04:59.780> than<00:04:59.870> at<00:04:59.990> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
it has way more volume than at the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.439 
it has way more volume than at the
beginning<00:05:00.320> which<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:01.039> similar<00:05:01.430> effect<00:05:01.729> that

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
beginning which is a similar effect that

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.600 
beginning which is a similar effect that
you'll<00:05:02.600> get<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.139> dry<00:05:03.350> shampoo<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:04.100> got<00:05:04.490> it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
you'll get with dry shampoo but I got it

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.850 
you'll get with dry shampoo but I got it
using<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:04.940> baby<00:05:05.449> powder<00:05:05.750> which<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.169> less

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
using just baby powder which is less

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.700 
using just baby powder which is less
expensive<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.759> easy<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.720> find<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.440> this<00:05:09.560> is

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
expensive and easy to find so this is

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.629 
expensive and easy to find so this is
just<00:05:09.919> how<00:05:10.039> my<00:05:10.099> hair<00:05:10.280> looks<00:05:10.550> after<00:05:12.340> doing<00:05:13.340> both

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
just how my hair looks after doing both
