00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.290
 good morning to all you find beautiful gazette on the site pierobon 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.240
 trading. com nb found weekly canazei of the background field 500 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.480
 and as every time we help him flat to the last nose we have done is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.330
 practically a witness last June 19, 2006 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.599
 weight we see today's position 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.800
 Friday 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.850
 June 26, 2009 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.770
 last week there was a king splash with this state of the market mold 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560
 tempur you can see here 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.430
 our intermediate started in March 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.820
 he was metastock under the dates practically married to him 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.330
 and this is only for napoli action 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.950
 here is the intermediate water plant hinder taking place and we know it started 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.120
 March is the position practically on Friday which was the following 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.050
 in which I had centered by drill 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.390
 then the projection of the intermediate cycle that gave us 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.900
 this water situation 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.660
 matches puts at least the last 16 days of the cycle as this 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.400
 here 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.880
 i love may spent three days hear you pussy act of paying particular 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.900
 attention because the clown 5 side in fact we know that should start 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 the intermediate man is often there are phases as right as it is of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 accumulation that knows that it has a necessary strength 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460
 then try a new cycle 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.870
 and I said that 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.070
 let's see a little bit that 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.980
 the accumulation phase could last up to 8 days is a little past 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.710
 quietly the accumulation phase could even last 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.200
 and after equity days 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 let's see what actually happened on the market 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 here's what happened to the market we uploaded the data practically 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249
 yesterday it was Thursday 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.379
 and here is a strafigo of accumulation that if formulated in fact marketplaces 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.079
 went down again and is now churning up 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.359
 interesting to see that then in aura r8 antenna trending online 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.009
 descending 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:29.109
 you will understand the 16 day cycle and this is very important because it is the break 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.629
 of the mountain yesterday embor signal of confirmation of end accumulation 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.629
 how it was like state-what conduction was 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.399
 in practice a language 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.749
 detail dvd by and figures that are used to capture 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.259
 of stop bows correctly he slowly set himself long 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.649
 and then of ugly pieces on parties and raise here the starting properties of the 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.119
 much better its very high 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.519
 and then we see with the water plants vs maestrale 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:06.309
 where the new projection icon of the average consumer appears and we see that there 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.019
 we find like this point 4 stars your decoration belongs 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.989
 ak previous cycle 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.309
 therefore actually provita of departure besides averages there are 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:20.019
 let's see with the actors file and then they are the ones that give me the actual signal 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.329
 here they are the coletti oscillators 4 cycles and 16 days here is the icon 2 3 4 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.369
 the intermediate started in March 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.210
 king 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.739
 at stake was still a signal 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.449
 and 24 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.959
 then joke Wednesday 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.299
 hey d on this baroque a vedÃ¨ iperclub.it 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.330
 goodies in bikini on the minimum 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.280
 of the pc color 16 days and on the break practically already it could be entered 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.409
 therefore and therefore on three levels 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.689
 oxado tour also simply puthod back twenty tatoo prime feet up as well 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.780
 quietly entry peter a stop summary 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.799
 this is the projection we see now 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.749
 also on the cycle 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:08.429
 at 32 days of average I have a signal put here 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.429
 rihanna we do not know - not 70% source d 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.880
 13 between the minimum and maximum 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.880
 metis and we see inter intermediate better now is found 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:25.449
 to exit in turin zone of extreme of oversold therefore probable that eng a 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.699
 wall practically gta v su indicating minimum segments this week 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.629
 so it is very likely that it brings the new intermediate 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.520
 and we also see something in the world of life 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.759
 with practically spectroscopic analysis 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:41.860
 elen 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.560
 of the sp500 today we go out to see with weekly extension 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 the intermediate cycle we had a mini monza projection this 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.699
 even those week and spectroscopy 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.820
 and that therefore in all things they are returning are added to the favorite of 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.280
 starting 1 intermediate is very high 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.919
 kennels with the possibility of entering a bull's eye look for a point 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.280
 nor a relative minimum on which to slowly enter the market for those who did not 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.159
 did 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.740
 with this it is all goodbye and to the next hello everyone and good trading
