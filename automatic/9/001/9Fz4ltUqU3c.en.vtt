 you already know that you are in your channel up the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.670
 review this is going to be a quick video 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.619
 since what we are going to do is very 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 short is very salt and I will show you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 how to install what is apps sync up without 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 how do you know how to install all the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.710
 copied applications I'm not in favor 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.059
 of piracy but mostly to me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 like to try the games before 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 buy them because I've already bought games 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.550
 that look very attractive and the truth 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.290
 they end up being good rubbish for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 do it they're just going to have tour 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.890
 to handle in the part of sources are going to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 put edit 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 add sources and they will write apt 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.950
 point 178 point com so easy and you 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 they will give in adding or adding source 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.060
 As I already have it, I do not have to 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.760
 add simply I'm going to give you in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.590
 cancel in ready let's get into the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 repo that appears to me until the last 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 on this side we are going to give it to him and we have to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.110
 look for the accent let's go down until 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.060
 android 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.100
 this can be found from here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.250
 or you can search it from the tool 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.270
 search but let's make it easier 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.759
 since they do not think it costs a lot 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.030
 work and we already have it we have what 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.980
 install from 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.620
 to confirm 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.620
 and it's going to start running what decides 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.030
 once this is over, the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.830

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.960
