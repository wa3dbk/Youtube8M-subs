nice<00:00:00.450> and<00:00:00.690> simple<00:00:00.840> okay<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.310> can<00:00:02.460> see<00:00:02.610> they're

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
nice and simple okay you can see they're

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.329 
nice and simple okay you can see they're
together<00:00:02.970> there<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.959> that's<00:00:04.170> them

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
together there and that's them

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.460 
together there and that's them
push<00:00:05.759> together<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.420> that's<00:00:06.629> them<00:00:06.839> nice<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
push together and that's them nice and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.220 
push together and that's them nice and
tight<00:00:07.649> now<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.340> not<00:00:08.460> go<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> roll<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.990> into

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
tight now we're not go to roll this into

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.049 
tight now we're not go to roll this into
a<00:00:10.349> loop<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.889> can<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.219> they<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> separate

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
a loop you can see they want to separate

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
a loop you can see they want to separate
and<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:13.259> happens<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.950> mono<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.280> your

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and that happens with your mono in your

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
and that happens with your mono in your
braid<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.240> need<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.920> is<00:00:16.920> this

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
braid it's all you need to do is this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.099 
braid it's all you need to do is this
run<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> B<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> speed<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> they'll<00:00:18.900> want

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
run a B to speed up it and they'll want

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
run a B to speed up it and they'll want
to<00:00:19.199> stick<00:00:19.410> together<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:20.010> better<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.850> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to stick together a lot better so that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.150 
to stick together a lot better so that
makes<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> easy<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> control<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.010> we

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
makes it easy for you to control so we

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400 
makes it easy for you to control so we
want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> make<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> loop<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> same<00:00:25.140> size

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
want to make a loop about the same size

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
want to make a loop about the same size
as<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> 50-cent<00:00:26.279> piece<00:00:26.490> which<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> about<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
as a 50-cent piece which is about that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779 
as a 50-cent piece which is about that
big<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.439> quite<00:00:28.680> simply<00:00:29.039> pass<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.550> tag

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
big and then quite simply pass the tag

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.310 
big and then quite simply pass the tag
end<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> braid<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.140> that's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
end of the braid and because that's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.540 
end of the braid and because that's
really<00:00:31.590> short<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.070> comes<00:00:32.279> through<00:00:32.430> really

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
really short that comes through really

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.660 
really short that comes through really
quickly<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.630> whole<00:00:33.870> leader<00:00:34.550> through<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
quickly and the whole leader through the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.850 
quickly and the whole leader through the
hole<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.690> an<00:00:36.840> overhand<00:00:37.380> knot<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
hole so that's an overhand knot it's a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
hole so that's an overhand knot it's a
graining<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> knot<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.390> do

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
graining on it's the knot that you do

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.470 
graining on it's the knot that you do
it's<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.879> phone<00:00:42.059> there

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it's there or there's my phone there

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
it's there or there's my phone there
it's<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> knot<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.969> when<00:00:44.969> you're

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it's the knot that you do when you're

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
it's the knot that you do when you're
tying<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.450> shoelaces<00:00:45.690> before<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
tying your shoelaces before you do the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.700 
tying your shoelaces before you do the
loop<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> loot<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
loop if we put the loot in so if you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.690 
loop if we put the loot in so if you
can't<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:50.399> something<00:00:50.520> wrong

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can't do that there's something wrong

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
can't do that there's something wrong
with<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.570> then<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.199> times

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
with it and then there's two times

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.819 
with it and then there's two times
through<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.570> there's<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.590> obviously

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
through and then there's three obviously

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
through and then there's three obviously
and<00:00:56.539> four<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.289> five<00:00:59.180> to<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.629> nice

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and four and five to make it all nice

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.260 
and four and five to make it all nice
and<00:01:00.930> neat<00:01:01.199> roll<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.039> sexy<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.609> alright

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and neat roll down a sexy like alright

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
and neat roll down a sexy like alright
so<00:01:03.570> there's<00:01:03.750> our<00:01:03.870> five<00:01:04.140> through<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so there's our five through then all you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.080 
so there's our five through then all you
need<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.549> make<00:01:05.700> sure<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.880> you're

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
need to do is make sure that you're

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.580 
need to do is make sure that you're
holding<00:01:06.270> onto<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.530> side

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
holding onto these two on this side

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
holding onto these two on this side
really<00:01:08.040> tight<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.850> obviously<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.290> on

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
really tight and obviously these two on

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
really tight and obviously these two on
this<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.920> tight<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.820> pull<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> down

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this side really tight and pull it down

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.789 
this side really tight and pull it down
their<00:01:12.900> first<00:01:13.049> thing<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.350> gonna<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
their first thing that's gonna do is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
their first thing that's gonna do is
roll<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> figure<00:01:14.520> eight<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> was

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
roll into a figure eight now as I was

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
roll into a figure eight now as I was
saying<00:01:15.869> before<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.710> trouble<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.369> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
saying before the trouble I had was with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
saying before the trouble I had was with
the<00:01:17.549> seven<00:01:18.000> turns<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> heavier<00:01:18.990> lines<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the seven turns on the heavier lines is

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
the seven turns on the heavier lines is
that<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> went<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> point<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that when it went to this point here and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.929 
that when it went to this point here and
wanted<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> rolling<00:01:22.799> further<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
wanted a rolling further it would have a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
wanted a rolling further it would have a
lot<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> trouble<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
lot of trouble so you just want it to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520 
lot of trouble so you just want it to
roll<00:01:26.100> down<00:01:26.570> nice<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.600> evenly<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.350> I'll

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
roll down nice and evenly now I'll

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.219 
roll down nice and evenly now I'll
actually<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> wrap<00:01:29.759> around<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.810> index

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually get a wrap around my index

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
actually get a wrap around my index
finger<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> tip<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> my

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
finger there and around the tip of my

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.429 
finger there and around the tip of my
index<00:01:33.240> finger<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.140> I've<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
index finger there just so I've got a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.840 
index finger there just so I've got a
bit<00:01:34.590> more<00:01:34.740> tension<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.460> pressure<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bit more tension a bit more pressure I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.950 
bit more tension a bit more pressure I
can<00:01:36.090> apply<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.259> keep<00:01:37.439> pulling<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.920> up

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
can apply and just keep pulling it up

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.289 
can apply and just keep pulling it up
until<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.920> looks<00:01:41.189> something<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
until it looks something like that

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.660 
until it looks something like that
now<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.380> close<00:01:44.649> up<00:01:44.890> inspection<00:01:45.039> of<00:01:45.579> this

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
now on the close up inspection of this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.029 
now on the close up inspection of this
knot<00:01:45.939> on<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> knife<00:01:46.359> you<00:01:46.600> can<00:01:46.750> wear<00:01:47.439> as<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.649> camera

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
knot on a knife you can wear as a camera

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.679 
knot on a knife you can wear as a camera
there<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.399> probably<00:01:49.030> will<00:01:49.210> run<00:01:49.420> out<00:01:49.570> of

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
there it is probably will run out of

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.800 
there it is probably will run out of
focus<00:01:49.960> pretty<00:01:50.380> soon<00:01:51.030> yeah<00:01:52.030> right<00:01:52.360> about<00:01:52.600> there

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
focus pretty soon yeah right about there

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.749 
focus pretty soon yeah right about there
so<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:53.740> sort<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.130> see<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.610> look

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
so you can sort of see if you look

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.399 
so you can sort of see if you look
really<00:01:55.000> closely<00:01:55.329> your<00:01:55.750> nose<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:56.259> your

means<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> loops<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.319> gone<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:14.950> so

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
means that the loops have gone down so

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780 
means that the loops have gone down so
what<00:02:15.880> happens<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.400> mono<00:02:18.400> or<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
what happens is the the mono or the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.670 
what happens is the the mono or the
braid<00:02:19.030> loops<00:02:19.329> depending<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.200> which<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.530> which

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
braid loops depending on which of which

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.729 
braid loops depending on which of which
way<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.569> they've<00:02:22.569> gone<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.959> one<00:02:23.170> after<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
way it is they've gone in one after the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.009 
way it is they've gone in one after the
other<00:02:23.769> like<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.640> okay<00:02:25.269> they've<00:02:25.480> they've

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
other like that okay they've they've

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.930 
other like that okay they've they've
grappled<00:02:26.349> each<00:02:26.680> other<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.190> inside<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
grappled each other like that inside the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.309 
grappled each other like that inside the
knot<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.239> that's<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.599> important<00:02:29.110> part

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
knot and that's the important part

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.479 
knot and that's the important part
because<00:02:29.829> what<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.400> does<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.540> it

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
because what that does for you is it

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.210 
because what that does for you is it
puts<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.970> puts<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.329> line<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:35.110> mono<00:02:35.440> between

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
puts it puts a line of mono between

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
puts it puts a line of mono between
every<00:02:36.730> line<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.090> braids<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> braids<00:02:38.380> that

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
every line of braids and the braids that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.380 
every line of braids and the braids that
the<00:02:38.890> thing<00:02:39.099> that<00:02:39.130> bites<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.700> mono<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.150> half

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the thing that bites the mono in half

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
the thing that bites the mono in half
like<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.840> union<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.349> pretty<00:02:41.890> much<00:02:42.069> you've

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
like in a union on pretty much you've

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850 
like in a union on pretty much you've
got<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> ball<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.940> braid<00:02:43.720> around<00:02:44.290> one<00:02:44.530> single

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
got a ball of braid around one single

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.949 
got a ball of braid around one single
strand<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.459> mono<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:46.660> when<00:02:46.810> you're

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
strand of mono and then when you're

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.340 
strand of mono and then when you're
trying<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.440> get<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.799> lure<00:02:48.040> off<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> snag

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
trying to get your lure off a snag

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.410 
trying to get your lure off a snag
shocking<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.280> brave<00:02:51.850> tightens

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
shocking it like that the brave tightens

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.990 
shocking it like that the brave tightens
up<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:53.139> continues<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.739> tighten<00:02:54.130> up<00:02:54.190> continues

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
up and continues to tighten up continues

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.030 
up and continues to tighten up continues
to<00:02:55.150> tighten<00:02:55.329> up<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.470> doesn't<00:02:56.859> ever

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
to tighten up that it doesn't ever

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460 
to tighten up that it doesn't ever
bounce<00:02:57.970> back<00:02:58.329> it<00:02:58.540> doesn't<00:02:58.720> have<00:02:59.019> any<00:02:59.139> bounce

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
bounce back it doesn't have any bounce

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.430 
bounce back it doesn't have any bounce
resistance<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.220> has<00:03:00.250> no<00:03:00.670> no<00:03:01.569> softness<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.410> it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
resistance it has no no softness to it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.620 
resistance it has no no softness to it
braid<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.609> continued<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.060> bite<00:03:04.359> down

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
braid so it just continued to bite down

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.569 
braid so it just continued to bite down
and<00:03:04.690> bite<00:03:05.019> down<00:03:05.049> until<00:03:05.530> eventually<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:06.069> she<00:03:06.400> is

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
and bite down until eventually it she is

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.479 
and bite down until eventually it she is
one<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.389> these<00:03:07.530> three<00:03:08.530> or<00:03:08.680> four<00:03:08.950> or<00:03:09.100> six<00:03:09.370> I

one of these three or four or six I

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.099 
one of these three or four or six I
found<00:03:09.700> how<00:03:10.030> many<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.359> our<00:03:10.480> wraps<00:03:10.660> you're<00:03:10.870> doing

well eventually one of them will just

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
well eventually one of them will just
sheer<00:03:15.190> straight<00:03:15.639> through<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.690> single

this knot doesn't allow that to happen

this knot doesn't allow that to happen

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
wrapper and it gives it some shock

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.040 
wrapper and it gives it some shock
absorption<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.490> as<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.150> braids<00:03:58.420> trying<00:03:58.870> to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
absorption so as the braids trying to

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.770 
absorption so as the braids trying to
squish<00:03:59.560> down<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:00.610> can't<00:04:01.090> because<00:04:01.450> it's<00:04:01.600> got<00:04:01.750> a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
piece of soft rubbery mono between it so

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.140 
piece of soft rubbery mono between it so
it<00:04:05.260> acts<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:05.890> like<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> spring<00:04:06.760> now<00:04:06.970> it's

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it acts like that like a spring now it's

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.090 
it acts like that like a spring now it's
got<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.420> shock<00:04:07.690> absorption<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.500> spring<00:04:08.860> now

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
got the shock absorption of a spring now

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.130 
got the shock absorption of a spring now
and<00:04:09.400> that's<00:04:09.760> where<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> not<00:04:10.390> really<00:04:10.810> comes

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and that's where this not really comes

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.320 
and that's where this not really comes
into<00:04:11.320> its<00:04:11.440> own<00:04:11.740> when<00:04:12.100> you're<00:04:12.490> shocking<00:04:13.150> your

their<00:04:25.840> leader<00:04:26.110> in<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.530> check<00:04:26.800> their<00:04:27.040> lead<00:04:27.220> or

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
their leader in and check their lead or

their leader in and check their lead or
not<00:04:27.490> at<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.910> point<00:04:28.270> they're<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:28.780> keen<00:04:29.110> and

not at that point they're so keen and

not at that point they're so keen and
excited<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.860> pumped<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.250> little<00:04:30.430> strike<00:04:30.730> back

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
excited just pumped a little strike back

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.670 
excited just pumped a little strike back
out<00:04:31.120> there<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:32.050> know<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:32.230> get<00:04:32.410> Yvonne

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
out there and you know you get Yvonne

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.460 
out there and you know you get Yvonne
next<00:04:32.980> cast<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.400> snappy<00:04:33.730> comes<00:04:34.090> off<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:34.870> that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
next cast and snappy comes off so that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.190 
next cast and snappy comes off so that
that<00:04:35.890> five<00:04:36.220> turn<00:04:36.520> surgeons<00:04:37.150> from<00:04:38.110> the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
that five turn surgeons from the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.350 
that five turn surgeons from the
majority<00:04:38.740> of<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.920> reason<00:04:39.100> why<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.090> is

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
majority of the reason why I like it is

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.910 
majority of the reason why I like it is
that<00:04:40.390> it<00:04:40.780> does<00:04:40.960> have<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.440> shock<00:04:41.890> absorption

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
that it does have that shock absorption

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.990 
that it does have that shock absorption
factor<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.390> also<00:04:44.290> it's<00:04:44.670> incredibly<00:04:45.670> quick

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
factor in it also it's incredibly quick

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.930 
factor in it also it's incredibly quick
to<00:04:46.210> tie<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.870> he's<00:04:47.440> just<00:04:47.710> generally<00:04:48.400> good<00:04:48.760> and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
to tie and he's just generally good and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.690 
to tie and he's just generally good and
strong<00:04:49.240> even<00:04:49.840> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.140> don't<00:04:50.770> type<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.430> well

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
strong even if you don't type that well

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.670 
strong even if you don't type that well
but<00:04:52.330> if<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:52.600> have<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.750> couple<00:04:53.170> of<00:04:53.230> hiccups<00:04:53.470> and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
but if you have a couple of hiccups and

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.530 
but if you have a couple of hiccups and
it<00:04:53.770> doesn't<00:04:54.040> roll<00:04:54.190> down<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:55.090> know<00:04:55.210> very<00:04:55.450> well

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
it doesn't roll down you know very well

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.310 
it doesn't roll down you know very well
it'll<00:04:56.140> still<00:04:56.470> hang<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:56.860> there<00:04:57.040> so
