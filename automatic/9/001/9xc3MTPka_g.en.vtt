00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.390
 the existence of seven hills among the monuments 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.370
 and millions of tourists 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.419
 particularly in the crops 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:10.220
 what now 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.239
 if you are in a wheelchair 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.979
 is currently still an inviting one 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.000
 funny that i want to maintain the little church 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.989
 you should have kept an eye on that 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.989
 we already have accessibility 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.470
 is thereby a better CLA 2 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 if the rooms are doing well 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.800
 on the content 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.039
 that is not and have 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.680
 large room came space 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.150
 from this side of the bed you can do well but we can have 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.000
 the quality windows come with the cupboard 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.010
 of course not behind the net recently 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.069
 and then they have made a bathroom more 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.069
 and the sliding door that is ideal 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510
 breda it is quite large 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.719
 what's wrong here is that it 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.769
 his beautiful space but no cracks on the toilet 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.300
 a van twente 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.410
 falling down after a shower is ideal most a hotel room have a bath 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.980
 If you don't come in at all, you can drive economically with your wheelchair zone 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.050
 but they don't have a very small shower either 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.480
 session duration 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.790
 and of those 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.140
 go normally 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 the number of stages that swing the door, I think 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.730
 as long as it can have space it is actually ideal but I would really like it 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 want to advise you to organize it differently 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.200
 the hotel 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.930
 therefore also has its defects 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.310
 not the jury 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.310
 we go into the city 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.780
 i am beautiful to be but it is it is one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350
 it's not easy because then you are going to just go down 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 look 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.560
 or you didn't notice me and there were some facades and people there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.690
 ok view this 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.690
 on a blocking attack is open from the front 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070
 i don't really want to look that way just straight ahead 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 for believe to live year after year 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.199
 throw with a value meter 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.539
 Edith of five years already far too long 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.539
 made and that you should be able to take advantage of 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.900
 If you don't see the story or the other then you need a place 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.239
 where I at least have 2 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.909
 what for me 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.359
 everyone goes 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.009
 and see things 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.169
 not to mention 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.169
 to experience and not to 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.659
 it would go too far for me to make the ramps now 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.919
 further down 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.919
 saab the asphalt 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.149
 less beautiful 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.149
 all very happy 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.869
 the match very tasty 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.399
 that has acting read on 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.709
 it's the second year 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.319
 marco along 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 if you have to give a roman empire 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.089
 so we do it well but not close 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.010
 if it is possible to compare, Marc and I say maybe 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.339
 not nice especially made name with barcelona in berlin two cities 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:41.029
 absolutely and after half past eight to the instant it never quite accessible 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.209
 to be 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.809
 but i like and 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:48.029
 in addition, there are some reservations this year simply not 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.409
 to live by 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.230
 as stand
