00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.480
 hairdresser tv fundamental knowledge for 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.220
 Barber shares his experience 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.220
 substances in dna were given 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.220
 continue our lessons after two basic 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.470
 silhouette forms an array and graduated in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.410
 whose volume prevails over the length 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.680
 today I'll show you the progressive form 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.960
 which length prevails over the canopy volume 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.629
 contrasting progressive forms we 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.899
 we start to cut from the control strip 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.890
 which is one and a half wide 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.480
 centimeter 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.020
 from the forehead to the crown enable or bleeding 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.960
 from the control strip first strand 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.769
 the streets and celebrate the length that we have 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.769
 should stay 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.179
 let's say the length will be up to the chin 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.390
 progression is a smooth transition from 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.870
 short hair in elongated volume 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 hair contour based on this earlier 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.570
 marked length is necessary forehead I cut to 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.280
 shortening to the crown 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.070
 capture the entire control strip in one 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 delay is impossible therefore it is necessary 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 divided into different segments with 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.910
 using the control band 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 we set the profile of our 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.750
 future hairstyle 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.140
 parallel to the control strip choose 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 on one side of the strand and trim 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.270
 her from the control strip 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.079
 next strand from the same side 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.570
 trim the controllable strip when 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.579
 shearing control strip should be 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 always perpendicular to the surface 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.920
 heads all other strands 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.270
 successively trimmed cameos 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.619
 so we cut the whole side after 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.079
 as we pulled 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.979
 and cut the last strand on the bottom 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.270
 side zone 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.599
 we get ready-made progressive with 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.420
 one side ie shorter 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:14.049
 hair in volume with lengthening 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 on one side of the surplus is similar 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.420
 trim hair control line 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.730
 we will cut the opposite side 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.299
 if when trimming the control 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.230
 lane we swung forward then 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.239
 one of the sides will be longer and if 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.420
 the back pull will swing back 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.819
 that side will get shorter after that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.120
 how we cut all the frontal zones 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.579
 the street we turn to the haircut nape 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.489
 a guide for cutting the neck from us 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.489
 there will be a control point which is 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.260
 a fragment of the control band from 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 checkpoint do two 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:00.930
 vertical partings down center when 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:05.130
 this choose a strand pull it up 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.130
 control point up 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.659
 after the hair pulled 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.769
 cuttable focusing on the control 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:20.379
 point of the radial part we type 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:29.200
 the next strand from the point also choose 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:31.180
 we also cut it up precisely 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.349
 also radial partings we 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.139
 mow the opposite side 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:43.870
 now we need to perform a combination 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:48.060
 occipital and frontal volumes after 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.629
 cut our lateral and occipital hair 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.079
 combined ensured a smooth transition 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:58.689
 in a similar way we connect and 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.719
 the other side after shearing volume 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:05.230
 we get a light blurred outline in 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:08.349
 but many clients love 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.810
 so that the contour was hard so we 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.449
 do the edging we pull off the hair 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.389
 strictly down and cut the contour 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:18.130
 scissors on myself 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.250
 now we have I initially length 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.650
 bangs in the control strip and made 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.300
 unter we can smooth them their money 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.630
 fingers should be kept exactly under such 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.430
 do not cut off the corner 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:40.510
 so because we lose length and strands 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:45.030
 pull as close to your face 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:49.890
 now we have combined gradually 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:53.050
 the transition from the bang line contour 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.620
 so we got a gradual 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.540
 transition bangs occipital anton exactly 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.520
 the same transition we will do with 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.710
 the opposite side today we 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.320
 reviewed how the third is performed 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.420
 base silhouette i forum called 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.540
 progressive is this form 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:14.190
 differs in that its length 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.190
 prevails over volume 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.300
