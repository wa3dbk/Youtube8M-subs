00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.150 
the side view of the Optimus Prime isn't
actually<00:06:15.730> perpendicular<00:06:16.730> at<00:06:17.450> 90<00:06:18.170> degrees<00:06:18.500> I'm

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
actually perpendicular at 90 degrees I'm

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.090 
actually perpendicular at 90 degrees I'm
actually<00:06:19.340> using<00:06:19.640> my<00:06:19.790> Megaton<00:06:20.300> gun<00:06:20.510> to<00:06:21.100> just

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
actually using my Megaton gun to just

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.630 
actually using my Megaton gun to just
see<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.990> that's<00:06:24.140> a<00:06:24.230> bit<00:06:24.380> of<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.560> tilt<00:06:24.890> in<00:06:25.130> it<00:06:25.310> here

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
see it that's a bit of a tilt in it here

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.390 
see it that's a bit of a tilt in it here
but<00:06:26.300> that's<00:06:26.510> alright<00:06:26.960> but<00:06:27.890> you<00:06:28.040> can<00:06:28.190> actually

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
but that's alright but you can actually

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.700 
but that's alright but you can actually
adjust<00:06:28.700> the<00:06:29.210> tilt<00:06:29.450> if<00:06:29.780> you<00:06:30.110> push<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:32.710> four

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
adjust the tilt if you push the four

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.580 
adjust the tilt if you push the four
other<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:34.370> Chuck<00:06:34.669> mode<00:06:35.030> until<00:06:35.630> it<00:06:36.440> moves<00:06:36.800> the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
other the Chuck mode until it moves the

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.580 
other the Chuck mode until it moves the
suspension<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:41.590> cow-like<00:06:42.590> makes<00:06:43.190> it

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
suspension and cow-like makes it

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.570 
suspension and cow-like makes it
perpendicular<00:06:45.590> to<00:06:46.040> the<00:06:46.220> ground

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580
