00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
generally leaning one way just bend it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240

back against the grain or against that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
back against the grain or against that
way<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.180> certainly<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.809> eat<00:01:01.170> these<00:01:01.500> nothing

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
way you certainly can eat these nothing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
wrong with them you can chop them up use

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
wrong with them you can chop them up use
them<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> stuffing<00:01:04.530> things<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.700> if

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
them in stuffing things like that but if

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.960 
them in stuffing things like that but if
I'm<00:01:06.479> serving<00:01:06.990> portabellas<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> I'll
