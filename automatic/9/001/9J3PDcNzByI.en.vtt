major<00:00:49.150> ways<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:50.320> we've<00:00:50.680> got<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.070> take<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.310> look

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
major ways so we've got to take a look

later you can see growth and this growth

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.980 
later you can see growth and this growth
comes<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:30.009> two<00:01:30.219> ways<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.149> nerves<00:01:31.569> are

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
comes in two ways the nerves are

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.999 
comes in two ways the nerves are
regrowing

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
regrowing

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.910 
regrowing
but<00:01:33.490> also<00:01:33.759> with<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.749> nerves<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.409> the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
but also with the nerves is the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.910 
but also with the nerves is the
circulatory<00:01:36.579> system<00:01:37.539> so<00:01:37.780> brain<00:01:38.469> cell

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
circulatory system so brain cell

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.749 
circulatory system so brain cell
regeneration<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.569> possible<00:01:41.409> these<00:01:42.130> journals

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
regeneration is possible these journals

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.389 
regeneration is possible these journals
and<00:01:42.999> these<00:01:43.270> discoveries<00:01:43.840> are<00:01:44.399> suggesting

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and these discoveries are suggesting

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.020 
and these discoveries are suggesting
that<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.759> need<00:01:46.149> dark<00:01:47.079> healthy<00:01:47.799> chocolate<00:01:48.100> so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
that you need dark healthy chocolate so

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.029 
that you need dark healthy chocolate so
your<00:01:49.240> body<00:01:49.479> knows<00:01:49.840> how<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.109> use<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.859> help

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
your body knows how to use it to help

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.919 
your body knows how to use it to help
heal<00:01:51.520> itself<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.450> agree<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.259> agree<00:01:53.469> totally<00:01:54.340> and

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
heal itself I agree I agree totally and

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.099 
heal itself I agree I agree totally and
this<00:01:55.929> is<00:01:56.170> called<00:01:56.969> neurogenesis<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.450> regrowth

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
this is called neurogenesis the regrowth

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.010 
this is called neurogenesis the regrowth
or<00:01:59.380> growth<00:01:59.770> of<00:02:00.100> your<00:02:00.310> nerves<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.149> it's<00:02:01.719> very

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
or growth of your nerves and it's very

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.919 
or growth of your nerves and it's very
significant<00:02:02.920> because<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.399> Journal<00:02:03.789> of

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
significant because the Journal of

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.440 
significant because the Journal of
cardiovascular<00:02:05.069> pharmacology<00:02:06.069> says<00:02:06.850> that

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
cardiovascular pharmacology says that

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.620 
cardiovascular pharmacology says that
