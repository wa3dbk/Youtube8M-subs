are also very useful you shouldn't put
your<00:01:09.060> hands<00:01:09.270> into<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> chemicals<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.650> skin

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
your hands into the chemicals your skin

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
your hands into the chemicals your skin
might<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.400> sensitive<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:13.080> course

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
might be sensitive to it and of course

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
might be sensitive to it and of course
you<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.500> need<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.670> sink<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.400> in<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.580> case<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you will need a sink and in this case a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.140 
you will need a sink and in this case a
print<00:01:18.540> washer<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:20.009> wash<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.400> prints<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
print washer to wash your prints the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.100 
print washer to wash your prints the
prints<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.930> washed<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.369> sink<00:01:23.670> itself

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
prints can be washed in the sink itself

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
prints can be washed in the sink itself
with<00:01:25.110> running<00:01:25.439> water<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.960> use<00:01:27.960> one

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
with running water and you can use one

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520 
with running water and you can use one
of<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:30.630> plug<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> sink

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
of these to plug the sink

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 
of these to plug the sink
so<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> sink<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.000> fill<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so the sink can actually fill up with

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.800 
so the sink can actually fill up with
water<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.100> escape<00:01:35.750> down<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
water and then it will escape down the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
water and then it will escape down the
top<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> tunnel<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> wash

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
top of the tunnel and you can wash

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
top of the tunnel and you can wash
prints<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> sink<00:01:42.170> after<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.560> prints<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
prints in the sink after your prints are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
prints in the sink after your prints are
washed<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.090> squeegee<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.110> then

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
washed you can squeegee them and then

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
washed you can squeegee them and then
you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.979> dry<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.579> racks<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you can dry them in racks if you like

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.399 
you can dry them in racks if you like
but<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.290> also<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.880> these<00:01:51.409> quite

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
but you can also use one of these quite

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:03.240 
but you can also use one of these quite
cheap<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.909> print<00:01:54.270> dryer

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.339 

and<00:02:04.359> this<00:02:05.359> will<00:02:05.539> dry<00:02:05.750> resin-coated<00:02:06.409> prints

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
and this will dry resin-coated prints

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.089 
and this will dry resin-coated prints
very<00:02:09.349> quickly<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:11.090> matter<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.599> minutes

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.240 

in<00:02:16.099> order<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:17.200> make<00:02:18.200> up<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.590> store<00:02:18.920> chemicals

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
in order to make up and store chemicals

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.360 
in order to make up and store chemicals
I<00:02:20.290> would<00:02:21.290> suggest<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.930> try<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> find

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I would suggest that you try to find

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.740 
I would suggest that you try to find
storage<00:02:25.370> bottles<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:26.299> they're<00:02:26.720> very

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
storage bottles like these they're very

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.819 
storage bottles like these they're very
useful<00:02:27.140> because<00:02:27.910> if<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.180> bottom<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.599> half<00:02:30.440> or

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
useful because if the bottom is half or

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.190 
useful because if the bottom is half or
a<00:02:30.980> little<00:02:31.040> bit<00:02:31.459> more<00:02:31.489> than<00:02:32.120> half-full<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:33.019> can

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
a little bit more than half-full you can

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.120 
a little bit more than half-full you can
compress<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.829> like<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.910> exclude<00:02:35.420> air

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
compress it like this to exclude air

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.850 
compress it like this to exclude air
from<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.280> container<00:02:37.430> inside<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.680> way

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
from the container inside and that way

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.970 
from the container inside and that way
you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.750> keep<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.930> liquid<00:02:42.260> for<00:02:42.440> much<00:02:42.590> longer

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.130 

you'll<00:02:45.980> need<00:02:46.250> some<00:02:46.549> measuring<00:02:46.819> cylinders<00:02:50.140> for

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
you'll need some measuring cylinders for

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.600 
you'll need some measuring cylinders for
mixing<00:02:51.410> chemicals<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:54.010> you'll<00:02:55.010> also<00:02:55.250> need<00:02:55.549> a

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
mixing chemicals and you'll also need a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.100 
mixing chemicals and you'll also need a
timer<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.950> time<00:02:58.190> your<00:02:58.489> exposures<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.510> this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
timer to time your exposures in this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.229 
timer to time your exposures in this
particular<00:03:00.500> case<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.519> larger<00:03:01.970> comes

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
particular case this and larger comes

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.009 
particular case this and larger comes
with<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.660> timer<00:03:03.079> if<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:04.519> doesn't<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.630> can<00:03:05.810> use

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
with a timer if it doesn't you can use

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.030 
with a timer if it doesn't you can use
timers<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.709> these<00:03:09.220> or<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.940> use<00:03:12.040> very

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
timers like these or you can use very

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.250 
timers like these or you can use very
small<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.579> very<00:03:13.609> convenient<00:03:14.359> digital<00:03:14.840> timers

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
small and very convenient digital timers

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.650 
small and very convenient digital timers
like<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:20.650> finally<00:03:22.120> although<00:03:23.120> again<00:03:23.450> it's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
like these finally although again it's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.750 
like these finally although again it's
not<00:03:23.810> necessary<00:03:24.470> because<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.489> do<00:03:25.639> it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
not necessary because you can do it

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.349 
not necessary because you can do it
simply<00:03:26.090> by<00:03:26.269> hand<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.680> can<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.280> very<00:03:28.549> useful<00:03:28.609> and

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
simply by hand it can be very useful and

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.020 
simply by hand it can be very useful and
release<00:03:30.109> you<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.380> do<00:03:30.620> other<00:03:30.769> things<00:03:30.889> if<00:03:31.459> you

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
release you to do other things if you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.800 
release you to do other things if you
buy<00:03:32.269> our<00:03:32.299> film<00:03:33.290> processor<00:03:34.040> these<00:03:34.970> processors

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
buy our film processor these processors

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.960 
buy our film processor these processors
are<00:03:36.609> useful<00:03:37.609> because<00:03:37.790> they<00:03:38.109> rotate<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
are useful because they rotate the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.870 
are useful because they rotate the
developing<00:03:41.599> tanks<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.549> keep<00:03:43.549> fresh

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
developing tanks and keep fresh

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.930 
developing tanks and keep fresh
developer<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.630> fresh<00:03:45.139> chemicals<00:03:45.790> coming<00:03:46.790> to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
developer and fresh chemicals coming to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.379 
developer and fresh chemicals coming to
the<00:03:47.060> film<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:48.669> they<00:03:49.669> do<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.940> instead<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.269> you

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
the film and they do it instead of you

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.479 
the film and they do it instead of you
so<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.930> can<00:03:50.989> release<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.310> other

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
so they can release you to do other

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.549 
so they can release you to do other
things
