00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.020
 do not 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 very good today I come to show you the 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.330
 materials that I have from hama bid as 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.179
 You see, I have them inside a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.610
 box this box is a mobile grade 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.950
 It has its cover and everything and I have them 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.779
 here mixed because I do not have a box 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.970
 organizer like the one I have for the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 gummies I would like to have one for not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 have to be separating the bed bits 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.539
 by colors but good as I do not have it 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.460
 and somewhere they have to be 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.559
 saved I have put them inside this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.489
 box and at least they do not get lost 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 I buy some bags of accounts that come 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.190
 already mixed the colors it seems to me that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.409
 there are 500 in hama bits that come and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 every time I buy this bag that 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.530
 it's always the same always come the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 same colors I have made here to this 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.519
 box and so they are mixed is a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.559
 roll because you have to be separating 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.290
 the colors you lose a lot the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.550
 time in this box and these colors and 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.350
 there is transparent 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.239
 white gray 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.130
 this green that is a little pulling 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.830
 cake although in the camera more 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.020
 dark green and transparent also the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.090
 flesh color although it looks dark here 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.979
 sees as yellowish orange but not 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.750
 it's like this in reality this flesh color 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.369
 I use it to make faces for example 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.320
 when I made the santa noel de hama bit 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.299
 well I used this color also comes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.460
 this pastel pink that I love here is 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.049
 sees darker than it really is and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.390
 I use it a lot to do the 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.280
 Blushes or cheeks for example 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.490
 When I made the Santa Claus I put some 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 blushes with this rose then this is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.000
 pink that is a little darker is 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.479
 pulling red with this rose too 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 he made some lips this is red this other 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 it's orange even if it does not look like it's a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.890
 orange pulling red orange pulling 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.880
 transparent 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.979
 yellow and purple then I have this pot 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.659
 which is super big I do not know how many come 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.140
 because he does not put how many come but 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.970
 are too many different colors and what 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.720
 bad is that they all come mixed but 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.970
 It is a boat that is very economical and 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.009
 come many and to begin to be 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.350
 beginner to practice comes very 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.600
 all right 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430
 and in this boat come these colors are 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
 very basic colors but it comes in handy 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.210
 to go throwing good you see that there 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.100
 dark green white dark brown 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.720
 yellow black blue pink orange this is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.660
 a purple clarito rather could be 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.000
 say that it is a lilac and red this box 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.220
 I already showed it to you in a video from the web 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.190
 panda hong and as you can see it comes in the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.670
 colors red pink yellow orange green 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.890
 blue turquoise blue and purple clarito and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.010
 turquoise blue and purple clarito 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.720
 use to make them 2015 keychain 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.050
 then I have this bag that comes in 500 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.140
 are of a caramel or cream color or 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.730
 pulling to golden I do not know what color it is and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.220
 then he shows you bag they also come 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.130
 500 did not come in this bag this is a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.930
 Hermetic bag are a gray color 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.450
 dark throwing silver 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.030
 I have this ironing paper that is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.219
 special to iron these things 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.349
 I always tell you that you can buy paper 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.939
 of oven the paper that we put in the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.670
 trays for when are we going to do in 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.829
 cookies or pizzas that also goes and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.049
 I think it's also worth the onion paper or 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.120
 butter paper I have not tried it 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.299
 so one hundred percent I can not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.030
 say if it really works I bought this 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.829
 that ten papers were coming and I 'm still 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.750
 using the first one since I bought it 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.370
 I have no idea how long each 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.250
 paper but until this one is not me 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.840
 I'm not going to change him and now I 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 I'm going to show all the plates that I have 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.159
 Most of you have seen them but I have 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.680
 a new you are little ones are from the web 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.109
 panda hong I already showed them in the video that 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.669
 I made these in the form of a star 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.620
 plates that come with shapes are a lot 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.799
 more comfortable because nothing else you have 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.930
 to fill out the accounts then this 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.760
 that is heart shaped in my opinion 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.370
 If you want to make a heart, it will be 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.079
 much more perfect to do it on a plate 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.549
 of these to do it for example in a 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.979
 square plate because on a plate 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.840
 square will never be this form of 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.970
 heart can make a heart 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.280
 but it will not be so perfect then 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.250
 I have this little square this 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.170
 round 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.820
 and then there are the big plates that I 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.519
 I recommend them a lot because you can 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.280
 make bigger figures I have is that 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.770
 I bought myself recently it's hexagonal not the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.180
 I have used yet then I have this 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.250
 square which is what he used to 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.380
 do most of the videos and how do you 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.600
 I said in the video that they are javis os 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.480
 I recommend it because it is the most basic 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.910
 the one that is most used the round one also 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.860
 it's basic and it's used a lot so that 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.510
 you see the difference of the little one to the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.090
 big 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.460
 and also the difference of the small 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.230
 round and the big one and you're no longer 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.860
 I have nothing else I hope that I have 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.620
 liked and I send a greeting to all in 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.560
