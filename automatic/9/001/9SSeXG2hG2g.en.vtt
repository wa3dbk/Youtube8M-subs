now<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.770> why<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> small<00:01:56.310> tool<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:58.170> put

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now you know why use a small tool to put

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.380 
now you know why use a small tool to put
the<00:01:58.950> feet<00:01:59.189> inside<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.149> those<00:02:00.390> holes<00:02:00.689> there

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.730 

now<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.570> three<00:02:06.780> parts<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.350> clip<00:02:07.560> are

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
now all three parts of the clip are

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.400 
now all three parts of the clip are
secured<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> keyboard<00:02:08.490> bass<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:10.170> last

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
secured to the keyboard bass the last

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.940 
secured to the keyboard bass the last
step<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.780> place<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.230> key<00:02:13.880> onto<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> base

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
step is to place the key onto the base

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
step is to place the key onto the base
you<00:02:16.950> want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> Center<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> key<00:02:18.270> equal

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you want to Center the key equal

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
you want to Center the key equal
distance<00:02:19.560> from<00:02:19.650> its<00:02:19.920> surrounding<00:02:20.400> keys<00:02:21.140> press

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
distance from its surrounding keys press

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.730 
distance from its surrounding keys press
on<00:02:22.320> diagonal<00:02:22.530> sides<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.530> key<00:02:25.710> should

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
on diagonal sides and the key should

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370 
on diagonal sides and the key should
snap<00:02:26.100> into<00:02:26.310> place
