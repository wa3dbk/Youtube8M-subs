00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.429 
prawns because they're easy to clean and
I<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> size<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.140> i<00:01:58.170> have

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
I like the size of it so in here i have

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.920 
I like the size of it so in here i have
the<00:01:58.590> flour<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.460> baking<00:01:59.610> powder<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.689> egg

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the flour the baking powder and an egg

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.260 
the flour the baking powder and an egg
and<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> add<00:02:01.979> beer<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:05.270> we're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and we're going to add beer to it we're

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
and we're going to add beer to it we're
going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> mix<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.140> together<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
going to mix this all together and the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.010 
going to mix this all together and the
idea<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.759> create<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.300> batter<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
idea is that we create this batter and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780 
idea is that we create this batter and
then<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> put<00:02:11.160> our<00:02:11.220> shrimp<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
then we're going to put our shrimp in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.160 
then we're going to put our shrimp in
the<00:02:11.910> bed

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the bed

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
the bed
first<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.980> then<00:02:13.370> we're<00:02:13.459> going<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> dredge

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
first and then we're going to dredge

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.960 
first and then we're going to dredge
them<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.540> flour<00:02:15.110> coconut<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.190> seasoning

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
them in the flour coconut and seasoning

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940 
them in the flour coconut and seasoning
mixture<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.750> side<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.319> we're<00:02:18.770> going<00:02:18.860> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
mixture on this side so we're going to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
mixture on this side so we're going to
do<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> little<00:02:19.310> double<00:02:19.580> handed<00:02:20.180> dipping<00:02:20.930> today

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
do a little double handed dipping today

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
do a little double handed dipping today
it's<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.890> little<00:02:22.099> bit<00:02:22.220> messy<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:22.610> that's<00:02:22.940> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's a little bit messy but that's the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's a little bit messy but that's the
whole<00:02:23.060> point<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.450> cooking<00:02:23.810> cooking<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.230> fun

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
whole point of cooking cooking is fun

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.339 
whole point of cooking cooking is fun
when<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> use<00:02:25.010> your<00:02:25.040> hands<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:27.200> we

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
when you get to use your hands so we

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.650 
when you get to use your hands so we
have<00:02:27.530> our<00:02:27.560> batter<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:29.239> bubbles<00:02:29.390> will

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
have our batter and the bubbles will

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.650 
have our batter and the bubbles will
calm<00:02:30.650> down<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> little<00:02:31.250> bit<00:02:31.450> we're<00:02:32.450> going<00:02:32.569> to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
calm down a little bit we're going to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.680 
calm down a little bit we're going to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
thin pieces of Greenwood very slowly

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.300 
thin pieces of Greenwood very slowly
like<00:02:46.700> jerk<00:02:46.940> chicken<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.739> style<00:02:49.160> of

putting<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.080> shrimp<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.860> I'm<00:02:58.900> pressing

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
putting the shrimp in here I'm pressing

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.020 
putting the shrimp in here I'm pressing
down<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.830> coconut<00:03:01.400> sticks<00:03:01.819> to

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
down on it so that the coconut sticks to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.680 
down on it so that the coconut sticks to
it<00:03:02.980> I'm<00:03:03.980> going<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.549> more<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.450> like

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
it I'm going to do one more and I like

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.220 
it I'm going to do one more and I like
to<00:03:05.840> leave<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.049> tips<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.860> Prime<00:03:08.110> makes<00:03:09.110> it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
to leave the tips on the Prime makes it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.380 
to leave the tips on the Prime makes it
easier<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> handle<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.370> you're<00:03:10.819> dredging<00:03:11.120> it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
easier to handle when you're dredging it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.440 
easier to handle when you're dredging it
in<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.690> mixture<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:13.610> also<00:03:13.760> helps<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.299> to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
in this mixture and it also helps it to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.910 
in this mixture and it also helps it to
look<00:03:14.690> better<00:03:14.959> when<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.260> played<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:17.920> don't

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
look better when you played it I don't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.210 
look better when you played it I don't
like<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.070> really<00:03:19.370> thick<00:03:19.820> batter<00:03:20.090> either<00:03:21.220> now

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
like a really thick batter either now

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.530 
like a really thick batter either now
you<00:03:22.280> want<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.549> have<00:03:22.640> your<00:03:22.760> oil<00:03:22.940> heating<00:03:23.390> up

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
you want to have your oil heating up

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.990 
you want to have your oil heating up
while<00:03:23.720> you're<00:03:23.900> doing<00:03:24.049> this<00:03:24.760> we're<00:03:25.760> going<00:03:25.910> to

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
while you're doing this we're going to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.509 
while you're doing this we're going to
go<00:03:26.209> ahead<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.560> drop<00:03:27.560> our<00:03:27.799> prawns<00:03:28.100> into<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
go ahead and drop our prawns into the

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.550 
go ahead and drop our prawns into the
oil<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.820> we're<00:03:32.750> going<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.900> let<00:03:33.140> them<00:03:33.290> cook

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
oil and we're going to let them cook

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.690 
oil and we're going to let them cook
until<00:03:33.799> they<00:03:34.100> get<00:03:34.250> golden<00:03:34.670> brown

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.360 

so<00:03:40.330> our<00:03:40.450> shrimp<00:03:40.780> are<00:03:40.930> golden<00:03:41.290> brown<00:03:41.370> it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
so our shrimp are golden brown it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.699 
so our shrimp are golden brown it's
about<00:03:42.459> two<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.150> three<00:03:43.180> minutes<00:03:43.360> each<00:03:43.930> side<00:03:44.140> you

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
about two to three minutes each side you

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.710 
about two to three minutes each side you
want<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.950> flip<00:03:45.040> them<00:03:45.250> over<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.489> little<00:03:45.640> bit<00:03:45.849> I'm

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
want to flip them over a little bit I'm

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.420 
want to flip them over a little bit I'm
