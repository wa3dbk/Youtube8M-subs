00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
thinned out a little bit but it seems

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.200 
thinned out a little bit but it seems
like<00:01:58.200> police<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.380> my<00:01:59.619> friends<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.850> are<00:02:01.000> gay

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
like police with my friends that are gay

they didn't really care about the whole
chick-fil-a<00:02:03.580> thing<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.840> seems<00:02:05.350> like<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> media

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890
