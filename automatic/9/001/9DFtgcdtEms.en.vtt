00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> i<00:00:00.960> have<00:00:00.989> tried<00:00:01.350> many<00:00:01.380> times<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:02.070> get

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay so i have tried many times to get

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.860 
okay so i have tried many times to get
the<00:00:02.250> secret<00:00:02.520> exit<00:00:02.820> in<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.149> admittedly<00:00:03.780> i

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
the secret exit in here admittedly i

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.519 
the secret exit in here admittedly i
wasn't<00:00:04.140> playing<00:00:04.259> most<00:00:04.560> seriously<00:00:04.950> but<00:00:06.350> it<00:00:07.350> is

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
wasn't playing most seriously but it is

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.230 
wasn't playing most seriously but it is
harder<00:00:08.069> than<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.280> looks<00:00:08.400> because<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.030> have<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
harder than it looks because you have to

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
harder than it looks because you have to
get<00:00:09.420> into<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.719> area<00:00:09.840> before<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> stomping

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
get into one area before the stomping

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.530 
get into one area before the stomping
blocks<00:00:11.160> stomp<00:00:11.460> down<00:00:11.820> onto<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.420> might

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
blocks stomp down onto it and you might

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.010 
blocks stomp down onto it and you might
want<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.840> out<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.960> there<00:00:14.660> but<00:00:15.660> i<00:00:15.839> actually

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
want to get out of there but i actually

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.160 
want to get out of there but i actually
do<00:00:16.289> need<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.529> Mini<00:00:16.890> mushroom<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> so

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
do need the Mini mushroom for this so

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.290 
do need the Mini mushroom for this so
you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> nice<00:00:19.560> flower<00:00:19.890> or<00:00:20.250> move<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.180> any

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you can get a nice flower or move in any

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.070 
you can get a nice flower or move in any
way<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.359> relatively<00:00:27.750> early

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
way but so I think it's relatively early

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.970 
way but so I think it's relatively early
in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> hover<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:30.199> you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.590> mean<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.830> just

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
in the hover so you can I mean you just

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.650 
in the hover so you can I mean you just
have<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.340> basil<00:00:32.759> competencies<00:00:33.480> it's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
have to have basil competencies it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
have to have basil competencies it's
actually<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> middle<00:00:34.770> Everybody

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
actually at the middle Everybody

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.640 
actually at the middle Everybody
wouldn't<00:00:35.370> even<00:00:35.610> though

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
wouldn't even though

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.320 
wouldn't even though
yeah<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.400> doesn't<00:00:37.580> let<00:00:37.760> your<00:00:37.880> bubble<00:00:38.090> after

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
least i got the secret acted upon the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.630 
least i got the secret acted upon the
star<00:03:19.930> coin<00:03:20.140> maybe<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.010> star<00:03:21.190> coin<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:21.520> just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
star coin maybe the star coin was just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.280 
star coin maybe the star coin was just
out<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:21.940> something<00:03:22.300> stupid<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.720> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.060 

because<00:03:26.290> you've<00:03:26.860> doubled<00:03:27.310> apparently<00:03:32.070> why

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
because you've doubled apparently why

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.160 
because you've doubled apparently why
didn't<00:03:33.280> he<00:03:33.340> say<00:03:33.490> this<00:03:33.520> way<00:03:33.880> i<00:03:34.150> guess<00:03:35.020> because

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
didn't he say this way i guess because

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.830 
didn't he say this way i guess because
there's<00:03:35.620> not<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.920> regular<00:03:36.640> flagpole<00:03:37.270> de<00:03:37.450> exit

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
there's not a regular flagpole de exit

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.930 
there's not a regular flagpole de exit

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.630 

okay<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.390> i<00:05:12.540> would<00:05:12.810> try<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.140> do<00:05:13.410> this<00:05:14.010> but<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
okay so i would try to do this but it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.610 
okay so i would try to do this but it
really<00:05:15.150> wouldn't<00:05:15.600> work<00:05:15.810> out<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.200> i<00:05:16.380> mean<00:05:16.530> i

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
really wouldn't work out that i mean i

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.650 
really wouldn't work out that i mean i
could<00:05:16.860> probably<00:05:17.280> put<00:05:17.700> through<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.390> i

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
could probably put through it but i

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.200 
could probably put through it but i
don't<00:05:18.960> really<00:05:19.200> front<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.680> pry<00:05:19.980> pry<00:05:20.820> sprout

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
don't really front to pry pry sprout

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.360 
don't really front to pry pry sprout
Prufrock<00:05:21.780> right

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.370 

so<00:05:27.000> in<00:05:27.210> retrospect<00:05:27.449> that<00:05:27.720> start<00:05:28.080> point<00:05:28.260> is

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
so in retrospect that start point is

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:38.050 
so in retrospect that start point is
pretty<00:05:28.560> easy<00:05:33.530> okay

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.440 

and<00:05:38.660> another<00:05:39.020> really<00:05:39.470> gyp<00:05:40.000> secret<00:05:41.000> area<00:05:43.389> but<00:05:44.389> I

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
and another really gyp secret area but I

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.580 
and another really gyp secret area but I
guess<00:05:44.630> they're<00:05:44.780> really<00:05:45.020> not<00:05:45.110> all<00:05:45.320> that<00:05:45.350> will

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
guess they're really not all that will

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.780 
guess they're really not all that will
hidden<00:05:45.830> once<00:05:45.980> you<00:05:46.070> know<00:05:46.160> what<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.370> look<00:05:46.520> for

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
hidden once you know what to look for

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.900 
hidden once you know what to look for
which<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.300> really<00:05:47.419> not<00:05:47.720> all<00:05:47.900> that<00:05:47.930> hard<00:05:48.200> to<00:05:48.320> see

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
which is really not all that hard to see

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.659 
which is really not all that hard to see
