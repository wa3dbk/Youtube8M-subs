video<00:00:01.079> 17<00:00:01.730> while<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:02.760> get<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.090> front<00:00:03.389> wheels

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
video 17 while I get the front wheels

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.970 
video 17 while I get the front wheels
aligned<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.110> little<00:00:04.319> bit<00:00:04.440> here<00:00:04.680> they're<00:00:04.890> at

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
aligned a little bit here they're at

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.680 
aligned a little bit here they're at
least<00:00:05.040> running<00:00:05.460> parallel<00:00:05.940> now<00:00:06.150> still<00:00:06.540> have

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
least running parallel now still have

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.830 
least running parallel now still have
obviously<00:00:07.020> more<00:00:07.560> adjustments<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:09.330> go<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.690> them

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
obviously more adjustments to go on them

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.299 
obviously more adjustments to go on them
but<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.260> least<00:00:10.380> it'll<00:00:10.590> roll<00:00:10.800> somewhat

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
but at least it'll roll somewhat

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.640 
but at least it'll roll somewhat
straight<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.849> get<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.690> front<00:00:12.960> sheet<00:00:13.259> metal<00:00:13.500> off

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
straight I get the front sheet metal off

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.140 
straight I get the front sheet metal off
right<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> moment<00:00:14.340> while<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> was<00:00:14.820> working

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
right at the moment while I was working

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
right at the moment while I was working
on<00:00:15.240> side<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:15.719> bit<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.320> see

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
on side a little bit more so you can see

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.260 
on side a little bit more so you can see
the<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.250> tubing<00:00:17.640> better<00:00:17.820> than<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.060> last

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the the tubing better than the last

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
the the tubing better than the last
video<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.810> had<00:00:18.900> where<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> goes<00:00:19.289> down<00:00:19.560> inside

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
video they had where it goes down inside

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
video they had where it goes down inside
to<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:21.240> fans<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> backside<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to the fans and the backside of that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.519 
to the fans and the backside of that
radiator<00:00:26.689> yeah<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.289> box

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
radiator yeah and I get this little box

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.990 
radiator yeah and I get this little box
finished<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.550> working<00:00:29.880> on

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
finished up that I was working on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.630 
finished up that I was working on
previously<00:00:30.810> where<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.099> housing<00:00:32.340> some

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
previously where it's been housing some

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.840 
previously where it's been housing some
relays<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> few<00:00:34.280> connectors<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.399> fuses

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
relays and a few connectors and fuses

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100 
relays and a few connectors and fuses
and<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.090> sort<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> stuff<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.840> should<00:00:37.020> be

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and that sort of stuff so that should be

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
and that sort of stuff so that should be
a<00:00:37.170> nice<00:00:37.290> accessible<00:00:37.860> position<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
a nice accessible position for when the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
a nice accessible position for when the
hoods<00:00:39.390> open<00:00:39.570> later<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> whole

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
hoods open later on when the whole

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
hoods open later on when the whole
body's<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.760> souther<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.629> connect<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
body's on and souther will connect to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
body's on and souther will connect to
here<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> finished<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.800> his<00:00:43.950> wire<00:00:44.190> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
here I finished up with his wire that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.750 
here I finished up with his wire that
goes<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.879> Oh<00:00:46.160> actually<00:00:47.160> gonna<00:00:47.520> hook<00:00:47.640> up

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
off for the whole vehicle so I think

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.920 
off for the whole vehicle so I think
that's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.979> probably<00:01:59.310> good<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.930> and
