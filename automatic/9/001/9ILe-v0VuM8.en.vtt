cousin the black rider for a few

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
cousin the black rider for a few
different<00:01:01.379> reasons<00:01:01.969> firstly<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.539> guys<00:01:03.960> are

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
different reasons firstly these guys are

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
different reasons firstly these guys are
grazers<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> look<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.270> their<00:01:06.450> mouths

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
grazers so if you look at their mouths

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
grazers so if you look at their mouths
they<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.560> real<00:01:08.330> rectangular<00:01:09.330> shape

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

I'm really big squishy lips that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'm really big squishy lips that's
because<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.080> eat<00:01:13.320> things<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.770> grass<00:01:14.220> but

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
because they eat things like grass but

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
because they eat things like grass but
if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> compare<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> their<00:01:16.439> cousin<00:01:16.830> the
