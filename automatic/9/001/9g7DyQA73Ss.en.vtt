sixteen<00:00:40.290> gauge<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> tab<00:00:41.719> 12<00:00:42.719> gauge<00:00:42.960> 20

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sixteen gauge on the tab 12 gauge 20

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
sixteen gauge on the tab 12 gauge 20
gauge<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> goes<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.850> any

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
gauge right there so it goes with any

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
gauge right there so it goes with any
gun<00:00:45.270> any<00:00:45.600> shotgun<00:00:46.079> it'll<00:00:46.320> work<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.710> any

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

Remington<00:00:48.000> anyway<00:00:48.360> um<00:00:48.539> came<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.410> three

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
Remington anyway um came with three

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
Remington anyway um came with three
choke<00:00:50.010> tubes<00:00:50.280> came<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> modified<00:00:53.600> full

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
choke tubes came with a modified full

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
choke tubes came with a modified full
and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> improved<00:00:56.070> cylinder<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and then I have the improved cylinder in

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
and then I have the improved cylinder in
there<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:56.969> now<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.960> cool<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there right now it's really cool that it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.549 
there right now it's really cool that it
came<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.039> improved<00:00:59.370> cylinder<00:00:59.579> because

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
came with an improved cylinder because

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.299 
came with an improved cylinder because
then<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.359> shoot<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.680> slugs<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.890> buckshot

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
then you can shoot up slugs and buckshot

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.080 
then you can shoot up slugs and buckshot
out<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.880> away

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
out of it right away

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.890 
out of it right away
at<00:01:06.750> least<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.460> improved<00:01:09.330> cylinder

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
at least I I use an improved cylinder

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.859 
at least I I use an improved cylinder
pretty<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> time<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.250> shoot<00:01:11.869> heavier

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
pretty much all the time I shoot heavier

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
pretty much all the time I shoot heavier
loads<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
loads like that so I don't know you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
loads like that so I don't know you
could<00:01:15.479> probably<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.170> without<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.130> just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
could probably do it without but I just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.840 
could probably do it without but I just
do<00:01:17.520> anyway<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.729> have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
do anyway so as you can see I don't have

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
do anyway so as you can see I don't have
anything<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.530> everyone<00:01:22.860> knows

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
anything in there just so everyone knows

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
anything in there just so everyone knows
okay<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.750> came<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
okay I got the one that came with the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
okay I got the one that came with the
wood<00:01:25.259> stock<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:26.180> really<00:01:27.180> liked<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.759> way

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
wood stock I really liked then the way

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.260 
wood stock I really liked then the way
it<00:01:29.970> works<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> feels<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.310> ever<00:01:32.729> do

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it works the way it feels if I ever do

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
it works the way it feels if I ever do
do<00:01:34.020> anything<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> gun<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.670> first<00:01:35.970> thing

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
do anything to this gun the first thing

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.490 
do anything to this gun the first thing
I'll<00:01:36.210> probably<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
I'll probably do is get a different one

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.880 
I'll probably do is get a different one
maybe<00:01:37.950> something<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.729> lighter<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.890> not

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
maybe something a little lighter and not

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
maybe something a little lighter and not
that<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> heavy<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> guns<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.180> too

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that this is heavy this guns not too

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.280 
that this is heavy this guns not too
heavy<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.750> all<00:01:42.810> really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
heavy at all really

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
heavy at all really
so<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:45.210> pack<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.140> forward<00:01:46.500> quick<00:01:46.970> let<00:01:47.970> me

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so I will pack this forward quick let me

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.440 
so I will pack this forward quick let me
set<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:51.439> alright<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.060> here's<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.210> looks

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
set this alright so here's what it looks

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.469 
set this alright so here's what it looks
like<00:01:55.340> set<00:01:56.340> forward<00:01:56.820> um<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:59.040> box<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.090> came

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like set forward um the box it came

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.289 
like set forward um the box it came
disassembled<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.369> take<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> end<00:02:02.850> cap<00:02:03.090> off

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
disassembled so you take the end cap off

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.590 
disassembled so you take the end cap off
just<00:02:04.020> take<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> barrel<00:02:04.619> off<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.360> pretty<00:02:06.360> much

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
just take the barrel off and pretty much

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.609 
just take the barrel off and pretty much
fit<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:08.420> assembly<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
fit in there like that assembly is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
fit in there like that assembly is
simple<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.190> mean<00:02:11.640> there's<00:02:11.910> no<00:02:12.060> assembly<00:02:12.330> really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
simple I mean there's no assembly really

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.670 
simple I mean there's no assembly really
required<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.379> guess

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
required I guess

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.660 
bead pretty much I mean it's plastic but
it's<00:03:11.939> pretty<00:03:12.060> cool<00:03:12.389> um<00:03:12.720> really<00:03:13.409> helps<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.920> One

a good grip there on both sides it has
that<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.889> then<00:03:29.069> it's<00:03:29.250> got<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.549> right<00:03:29.669> here<00:03:29.909> so
