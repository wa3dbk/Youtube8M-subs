hardened<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
leave it until it hardens and then you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
leave it until it hardens and then you
can<00:01:23.670> pick<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.840> done<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.439> it's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
can pick it up when it's done and it's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.569 
can pick it up when it's done and it's
ready<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> basically<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
