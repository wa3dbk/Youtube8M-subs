00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
in the background and you'll see this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
in the background and you'll see this
coach<00:00:17.430> wagon<00:00:17.789> parked<00:00:17.940> outside<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.320> does

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
coach wagon parked outside now this does

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
coach wagon parked outside now this does
take<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:20.039> bit<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> agility<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.029> expect

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
take a little bit of agility so expect

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
take a little bit of agility so expect
to<00:00:21.359> try<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> few<00:00:21.810> times<00:00:22.050> before<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.680> get<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to try it a few times before you get it

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.029 
to try it a few times before you get it
right<00:00:23.240> but<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> idea<00:00:24.689> basically<00:00:25.260> involves

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
right but the idea basically involves

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.070 
right but the idea basically involves
jumping<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.609> wheel<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.599> front<00:00:27.810> of
