 his only mention more to look for an exotic country 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.709
 distant in time and space 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.789
 a micro marin nailed between the sierras of the ifa and bahoruco 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.629
 with a small archipelago of tressis

 barbarita kids and the little island 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.390
 a panorama on list that serves as habitat act rotten 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.569
 flamingos and iguanas that among other species 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.779
 with a mangrove gauge your ounce campaign 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.949
 to the biological impact and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 as ecological is very interesting or not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.490
 for the cave art of caritas 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 indigenous petroglyphs possibly expert and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.230
 a rosary of communities frode to this water reserve whose fund already makes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 at 44 meters below sea level 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.030

 Cold dessert

 the cold mouth of hunk bartolome the students 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.730
 That's why the world is disappearing 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.540
 swift 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.230
 that is has been wrong in its forecasts 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.630
 and governments have abandoned 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.220
 the region to its fate 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 we are emergency business 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.050
 And talk about eta as I bevin of your mothers bouquet and the best thing to say 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.500
 until so much reduce the family live around 24 ore 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 although then the most affected 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.950
 percent after 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 but okay 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960
 video for mendez 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 and consequently we are going to bring this problem growing and what comes is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350
 that the one that showed the people who live 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.749
 in few of horn that also pricked meters below sea level 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.319
 the people who live in which by rivera to see that they are also below the 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.780
 sea ​​level the people who live in the northern part of the sport 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 which is also below sea level 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.670
 and the people who live in the community of mika those who are in the area this one 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.549
 we can provicario in the zone galván tamayo there are lands with vocation 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.620
 agricultural and there's a lot of water 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.779
 until 1978 it was said that the level of the waters of the lake would descend 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.139
 because of evaporation 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.019
 ya kids and the 12 million dose 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.789
 a piece of earth 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.219
 that connected with 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.319
 but from the david hurricane the equilibrium was altered 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 and in a demonstration that natural processes 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.239
 they can be quick 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.870
 the level has been rising due to the desperation of the population 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.289
 and the indifference of the government 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.659
 but I think that the government is 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.060
 waiting to see if weather conditions improve in the 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.590
 region and hydrological conditions 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 the work of extinction 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.099
 and we can not be 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.510
 a song to the strong with nature 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.930
 the human being has Catalan to do it with the word poverty 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.010
 and to the extent that it evaluates everything that may occur the cost of this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.899
 measurement can lack lives and properties 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 the national park lake enriquillo island kids 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.519
 disappears 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.349
 not only is terrestrial communication between the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.779
 communities that circumnavigate the lake 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.999
 but the flood is a threat to the lives of the locals 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.799
 and all lost everything 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.759
 but he has land 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.819
 the mediators 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.909
 follow things well as 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.309
 soon we can say that the adult 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.829
 about the defeat of both 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.249
 when winning 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.029
 the water the pilot of that area where the people 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.319
 really today lives and have agricultural land 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.669
 are lands that are of the 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.700
 and the year in which the operation began 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.699
 who is claiming this space 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.579
 based on its dynamics 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.579
 natural that 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.199
 super extension 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.659
 the reasons for the increase in the level of the waters of the lake are not clear 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.469
 and there are different theories 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.029
 as well as varied proposals to face the problem 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:58.989
 implant 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.389
 evacuation timbre location of what that community would be that they are 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.329
 designate it 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.909
 and another one of the recommendations could increase should look for the way 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.729
 balance what would be the lake enriquillo sumatra side and the the lagoon 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.769
 the lagoon of cabral 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.599
 slow down the region is not easy 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.239
 and still possible 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.900
 already the damage is done 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.279
 because the waters of Lake Enriquillo are saline puppets 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.529
 and although the waters returned to lower 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.979
 agricultural crops could not be recovered because the salinity 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 would render them sterile for both agriculture 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.629
 as to produce pasture for livestock 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:40.699
 that is to say 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.389
 the production sources of these towns 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.879
 it would be lost 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.539
 others suggest the flood of the aria 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.740
 joining the lake enriquillo with lake psoe 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.080
 a crazy idea because in fact the lakes are in you interconnected from 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.710
 underground way 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.879
 and this would be tantamount to speeding up the process 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.129
 and although the proposal contemplates changing agricultural production by fishing 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.979
 it is forgotten that not all marine species adapt to hypersaline arcs 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.120
 Reclaimed tilapia and produced by 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.080
 also 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.900
 it would be a communication alteration 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.409
 first because you do not know sucre - bolivia recovered 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:24.860
 workers 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.650
 randy jackson there's no way 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.729
 second 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.729
 what the state can do 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.539
 now is to move all those people attended auspicious for the work of 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:38.659
 agricultural 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.029
 as serious 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.259
 He can not do it 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.210
 the American crocodile whose population and length is one of the largest in the world 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.009
 in the wild 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.210
 it is an endangered species in the country 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.240
 and uses the sands of the island kids and shores of the lake to spawn 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.530
 having lost the costa rica bread docked by the waters 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.079
 these disoriented reptiles look for places to reproduce 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.349
 it is not an exception for ignorance the p 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.689
 and the use of your pp freedom 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.689
 eight years that allegedly serve as an apprehension 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.319
 the laments and mangroves and places where their fruits are established 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.180
 as well as the wines according to witnesses of the victory 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.439
 you need in the saone tree fruit 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:32.749
 They migrate in search of food what their hunting would mean 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.650
 some raise the dilemma move the lake or move the communities obviously 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.539
 morel the voice - hits 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.909
 presumably 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.909
 and moving communities equals creating a surge 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.869
 of refugees in their own country 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.229
 without housing 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.029
 without means of support 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.189
 and leaving behind its origins 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.740
 and without country hagens 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.719
 like the spring of the hills 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:02.559
 urgently needed a plan of territorial ordering of all the 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.050
 Lake Enriquillo environment has never been done 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.170
 should be done is such an ideal opportunity that the government has to establish 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.270
 that plan of territorial ordering in such a way that from now on 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.949
 urban site is below the quota ten meters above the level of the 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:18.689
 sea 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.219
 so be it 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:25.439
 surrender to the Kuchar nature as the Dutch did when they took 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.889
 space more 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.979
 one thing seems to be the most accepted theory 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:32.499
 the evil claims its space 

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.419
 and wants to return to its primitive state 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:37.680
 a marine channel that pol 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.990
 Prince Port 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.020
 with the support of the psoe 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.809
 the creation
