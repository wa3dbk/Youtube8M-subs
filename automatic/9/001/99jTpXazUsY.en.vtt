00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
2007 by glass shoot or you know it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
2007 by glass shoot or you know it's
sort<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.509> throwback<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.439> older<00:01:22.710> style

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
sort of a throwback to an older style

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.520 
sort of a throwback to an older style
that<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> 60s<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> look

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that they had in the 60s and if you look

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
that they had in the 60s and if you look
at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> watch<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> 60s<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> looks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
at the watch from the 60s it looks

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
at the watch from the 60s it looks
almost<00:01:27.600> identical<00:01:28.200> except<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.799> 30

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
almost identical except it's 30

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
almost identical except it's 30
I<00:01:29.579> believe<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.000> 35<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.750> 36<00:01:31.079> millimeters<00:01:31.650> as

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
I believe it's 35 or 36 millimeters as

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.179 
I believe it's 35 or 36 millimeters as
opposed<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> 39<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:34.189> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
opposed to 39 which this one is and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.450 
opposed to 39 which this one is and
that's<00:01:35.880> only<00:01:36.030> from<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> front<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:37.049> behind

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
that's only from the front from behind

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
that's only from the front from behind
it<00:01:38.460> looks<00:01:38.640> quite<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.060> different<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it looks quite a bit different this one

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.819 
it looks quite a bit different this one
here<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> moment

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here if you take a look at the moment

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.639 
here if you take a look at the moment
close-up<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.689> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.200> there's<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
close-up you can see that there's a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
close-up you can see that there's a
sapphire<00:01:47.040> crystal<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.930> cut<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.570> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
sapphire crystal that's cut here and you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
sapphire crystal that's cut here and you
can<00:01:51.720> actually<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.500> crystal<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.159> actually

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
can actually the crystal is actually

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.109 
can actually the crystal is actually
shaped<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.600> plateau<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.850> see

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
shaped like a plateau and you can see

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.969 
shaped like a plateau and you can see
the<00:01:57.240> side<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> 21<00:01:58.439> carat<00:01:58.799> rotor<00:02:00.979> it's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the side of the 21 carat rotor it's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.980 
the side of the 21 carat rotor it's
actually<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.909> cool

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.840 

I'm<00:02:06.990> very<00:02:07.260> beautiful<00:02:07.800> back<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:10.850> it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
I'm very beautiful back on this one it's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.720 
I'm very beautiful back on this one it's
a<00:02:11.910> bit<00:02:12.030> smaller<00:02:12.480> than<00:02:12.950> many<00:02:13.950> other<00:02:14.160> watches

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a bit smaller than many other watches

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.600 
a bit smaller than many other watches
that<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> thinking<00:02:16.980> I've<00:02:17.130> known<00:02:17.370> me<00:02:17.550> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that I have a thinking I've known me it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.130 
that I have a thinking I've known me it
was<00:02:17.700> actually<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.090> smallest<00:02:18.450> watch<00:02:18.720> they<00:02:18.990> own

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
was actually the smallest watch they own

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.080 
was actually the smallest watch they own
right<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:22.040> actually<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.459> small<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.060> that

blue croco this is an aftermarket Hirsh
a<00:02:39.510> classic<00:02:40.290> crock<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> same
