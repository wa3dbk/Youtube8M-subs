 hello all welcome back to 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.250
 our channel today we are going to talk about 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:15.400
 the care of our teeth 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.910
 baby our baby's teeth can 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.740
 suffer some damage if this can be 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.570
 extend also to your teeth that are 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.060
 below your in quotes that we be 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.580
 permanent also and it is for this reason 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.580
 that must muscle from a first 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.789
 moment from the first moment before 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.699
 that comes out from both the gums 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.420
 and all this we must do of the 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.950
 next way the first one when it's a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.710
 baby when we have our baby 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.800
 teeny with gas dating and with water 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.350
 we're just going to clean his 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.050
 sensitivity withdrawing from all 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.270
 remains of milk that you have and this 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 we can do once a day looking for the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.500
 more appropriate time than our 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.690
 and that is calm that is not irritated 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.910
 to start with oral care 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.900
 the second care that we are going to have is 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.490
 when they start to come out 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 enough cycles from the first 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.940
 moment and let's start with a brush 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 dental for babies for children in a 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.170
 brushed to do it so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.630
 routine that gets used to open 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 your little mouth that you are going to introduce 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 brush and it's more a daily routine of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 care in the streets 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 you can do it with water if you want or 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.870
 with a toothpaste or toothpaste 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.960
 for small children stadiums in the six 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.750
 aÃ±itos with a little bit is enough because 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.970
 remember that your baby will swallow 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.120
 limitations with a little bit of is more 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 enough 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.870
 Baby creams from 0 to 6 years old for 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.870
 children 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.560
 teeth 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.560
 a little bit of coarse cream 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.040
 we have a little water 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.900
 you also burn 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.349
 Y 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.900
 there is back 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.760
 very well we should have is at the time of 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.220
 offer our baby goodies 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.739
 sweet chocolates very very sugary already 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.380
 that all this is going to affect your teeth 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.670
 also when our baby is going to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 sleep there are sleeping with him lived from 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.170
 credit remembers to be removed immediately 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.630
 after he falls asleep because this one 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.180
 also pushes the listener changes the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.769
 position then it is very important 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.950
 take care that when he was already a friend, 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.260
 we removed the preterite the bottle or 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.769
 also your appetite when you have already 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.840
 Asleep withdraw your appetite and remember 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.019
 that after 6 months you have to 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.780
 start little to finally take away the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.930
 pacifier so that we are not going to change the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.640
 position of the teeth because it remembers 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.920
 that the position in which the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.060
 milk teeth will mark the exit of 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.770
 permanent teeth 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.180
 then they will not start you 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.540
 come out flipped in positions like that a little 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.950
 strange 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.830
 remember that the first visit to 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.840
 dentist will be from two years and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.950
 half three years old when we already have the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.440
 denture of our complete and good 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.750
 or high if you have a problem that you 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.250
 identify is that it is serious and also 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.430
 the pain of the teeth 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.610
 caries will also cause your baby to 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.050
 the time to chew does not want to 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.330
 because if it hurts you will not want 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.740
 chew will not want to receive 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 solid food then take care from 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.050
 a beginning your teeth to avoid 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.840
