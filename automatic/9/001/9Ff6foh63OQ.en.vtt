00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 and in which we good indeed I recommend this hike 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.129
 Very nice birds for old ladies who are at home 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.730
 because as they are the most attached to having birds in 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.339
 in homes to harmonize them and especially with 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.929
 these percent 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.939
 Australian parakeets that today I come presenting 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.589
 that precisely fish and pets the Nazi camp their favor to lend us 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.679
 Well, this luck is in the nature of arias, as its name indicates. 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.079
 precisely d baena sanchez of Australian origin 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.620
 and bring them precisely in the 19th century and if you like it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.630
 I have turned especially the birds that 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.670
 usually because by its very nature 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.740
 because they are very the ticators this and above all that they sing to these birds then 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.950
 are indicated are also very cheap are easy to care for and about 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.360
 everything is sociable 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.940
 and they are easily domesticated also that it feeds session because it can leave you 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 is very economical since helios commented on apples usually carrots 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.909
 sweets 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.900
 oatmeal vegetables 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.100
 also grass seeds and good for people who like to create this 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 type of birds 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.100
 lutz is never advisable to start creating it especially - 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.350
 unless 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.570
 eight or nine months of age that they have is not recommended 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.700
 because the females are not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 first developed 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 Well this is the disuse of your body and can not produce 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390
 in games 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.370
 well, you can play them 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.980
 but possibly 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.660
 have defects have mutations and have me 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.610
 Well, some defect 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 it is important that at least the male does not have less than 10 months so 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.930
 regular 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.610
 the couple must have 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.450
 more than 12 months of age to start raising these birds because 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 they exist before and it is achieved 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.400
 cough to create this usually are very unique and safe etc and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.679
 nervous and then hams that we will have at home as a pet 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.009
 that has these characteristics usually 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.089
 and also good by the way there are many people as I said is dedicated to this 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.839
 the upbringing of these little birds 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.839
 and how to identify the males of the females 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.000
 it is very easy only as you can see 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.250
 at the top of your picket they have a fleshy 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:36.119
 and the males have it they have that part of bluish color while the 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.709
 females 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.719

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.699
 that we do not like raising the spirits to liven up our home 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.889
