see<00:00:50.150> there's<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.420> case<00:00:50.660> itself<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:52.810> then

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
see there's the case itself and then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.000 
see there's the case itself and then
there's<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.170> little<00:00:54.440> owners<00:00:54.680> manner<00:00:54.860> that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
there's a little owners manner that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.160 
there's a little owners manner that
comes<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.300> then<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.600> case<00:00:56.810> comes

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
comes with it and then the case comes

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.970 
comes with it and then the case comes
with<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.740> belt<00:00:58.040> clip<00:00:59.350> that<00:01:00.350> just<00:01:00.590> pulls<00:01:00.800> off

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
with a belt clip that just pulls off

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.539 
with a belt clip that just pulls off
just<00:01:01.190> like<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.840> actual<00:01:03.140> case<00:01:03.530> do<00:01:04.460> an

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
just like that and the actual case do an

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.649 
just like that and the actual case do an
idea<00:01:04.729> about<00:01:04.790> some<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.030> dimensions<00:01:05.479> about

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
idea about some the dimensions about

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.420 
idea about some the dimensions about
this<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.049> again<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.439> very<00:01:06.680> large<00:01:07.009> case

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
this and again it is a very large case

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.950 
this and again it is a very large case
because<00:01:07.880> it's<00:01:08.030> built<00:01:08.360> for<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.570> very<00:01:08.780> large

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
because it's built for a very large

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.599 
because it's built for a very large
device<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:10.749> 17<00:01:11.749> centimeters<00:01:12.609> this

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
device it is 17 centimeters this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.910 
device it is 17 centimeters this
direction<00:01:13.969> so<00:01:14.420> that's<00:01:14.689> about<00:01:15.020> six<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.740> three

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
direction so that's about six and three

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.249 
direction so that's about six and three
fourths<00:01:16.249> inch<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.899> nine<00:01:17.899> point<00:01:18.229> three

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
fourths inch it's nine point three

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.469 
fourths inch it's nine point three
centimeters<00:01:18.920> going<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:19.340> way<00:01:19.579> which<00:01:20.270> is

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
centimeters going this way which is

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.090 
centimeters going this way which is
about<00:01:20.719> three<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.170> five<00:01:21.350> eighths<00:01:21.530> inch<00:01:21.829> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
about three and five eighths inch and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.520 
about three and five eighths inch and
then<00:01:22.670> thick<00:01:23.299> it's<00:01:23.689> one<00:01:24.020> point<00:01:24.289> seven

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
then thick it's one point seven

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.039 
then thick it's one point seven
centimeters<00:01:25.189> or<00:01:25.429> about<00:01:25.840> three-fifths<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> an

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
centimeters or about three-fifths of an

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.779 
centimeters or about three-fifths of an
inch<00:01:27.200> thick<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:27.619> it's<00:01:27.740> not<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.159> thick<00:01:28.520> it's

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
inch thick so it's not very thick it's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.599 
inch thick so it's not very thick it's
not<00:01:28.969> very<00:01:29.179> bulky<00:01:29.509> but<00:01:30.289> just<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> LG<00:01:31.249> flex

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
not very bulky but just the LG flex

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.609 
not very bulky but just the LG flex
because<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.119> just<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.329> big<00:01:32.479> phone<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
because it is just a big phone this is a

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.849 
because it is just a big phone this is a
big<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.249> big<00:01:34.310> case<00:01:35.020> but<00:01:36.020> apart<00:01:36.259> from<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.619> size

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
big a big case but apart from the size

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.069 
big a big case but apart from the size
there's<00:01:37.759> not<00:01:37.999> there<00:01:38.539> aren't<00:01:38.630> really<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:38.840> whole

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
there's not there aren't really a whole

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.039 
there's not there aren't really a whole
lot<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.520> drawbacks<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.149> case<00:01:41.539> overall

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
lot of drawbacks to this case overall

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.080 
lot of drawbacks to this case overall
because<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.159> an<00:01:43.249> otterbox<00:01:43.639> you<00:01:43.909> know<00:01:44.030> you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
because it is an otterbox you know you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.809 
because it is an otterbox you know you

get very high levels of protection and
well<00:01:47.689> go<00:01:47.810> ahead<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.200> break<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.889> down<00:01:49.039> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
well go ahead and break that down a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.889 
well go ahead and break that down a

kind of curved but you can push that

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.710 
kind of curved but you can push that
down<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.290> it'll<00:05:46.470> flex<00:05:46.890> along<00:05:47.520> with<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.330> LG

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.450

into<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.440> rugged<00:05:53.010> case<00:05:54.290> last<00:05:55.290> I<00:05:55.470> want<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.680> point

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
into a rugged case last I want to point

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.380 
into a rugged case last I want to point
out<00:05:55.950> really<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.340> main<00:05:56.490> downside<00:05:56.760> as<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.180> said

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
out really the main downside as I said

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.430 
out really the main downside as I said
in<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.480> beginning<00:05:57.600> is<00:05:57.960> just<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.320> overall

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
in the beginning is just the overall

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.760 
in the beginning is just the overall
size<00:05:58.920> because<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.640> LG<00:06:00.120> Flex<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.200> such<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.440> big

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
size because the LG Flex is such a big

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.340 
size because the LG Flex is such a big
phone<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.430> think<00:06:03.060> creating<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.540> phone<00:06:03.780> case<00:06:04.020> for

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
phone I think creating a phone case for

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.710 
phone I think creating a phone case for
this<00:06:04.580> might<00:06:05.580> not<00:06:05.760> be<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.940> best<00:06:06.270> options

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
this might not be the best options

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.540 
this might not be the best options
because<00:06:07.020> it's<00:06:07.170> not<00:06:07.350> very<00:06:07.620> comfortable<00:06:07.950> to

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
because it's not very comfortable to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.490 
because it's not very comfortable to
carry<00:06:09.360> around<00:06:09.570> it's<00:06:09.840> not<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:09.990> most<00:06:10.110> portable

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
carry around it's not the most portable

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.920 
carry around it's not the most portable
device<00:06:11.400> out<00:06:11.610> there<00:06:11.670> but<00:06:12.480> nevertheless

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
device out there but nevertheless

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.430 
device out there but nevertheless
OtterBox<00:06:13.620> did<00:06:13.890> create<00:06:14.250> this<00:06:15.110> case<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.260> go<00:06:16.290> with

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
OtterBox did create this case to go with

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.080 
OtterBox did create this case to go with
it<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.650> can<00:06:16.680> see<00:06:16.890> it<00:06:16.980> is<00:06:17.070> curved<00:06:17.400> as<00:06:17.640> well<00:06:18.000> as

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
it you can see it is curved as well as

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.320 
it you can see it is curved as well as
the<00:06:18.240> phone<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:19.440> case<00:06:19.850> fits<00:06:20.850> in<00:06:21.000> Slab<00:06:21.180> by

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
the phone the case fits in Slab by

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.910 
the phone the case fits in Slab by
clicking<00:06:21.630> into<00:06:21.810> these<00:06:21.930> four<00:06:22.200> points<00:06:22.410> just

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
clicking into these four points just

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.920 
clicking into these four points just
like<00:06:22.980> that<00:06:23.310> and<00:06:24.030> then<00:06:24.150> can<00:06:24.270> be<00:06:24.300> carried<00:06:24.630> either

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
like that and then can be carried either

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.070 
like that and then can be carried either
vertically<00:06:25.500> like<00:06:25.590> this<00:06:26.040> or<00:06:27.080> horizontally

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
vertically like this or horizontally

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.080 
vertically like this or horizontally
like<00:06:28.290> that<00:06:28.920> however<00:06:29.370> because<00:06:29.670> it<00:06:29.790> is<00:06:29.880> such<00:06:30.000> a

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
like that however because it is such a

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.670 
like that however because it is such a
big<00:06:30.270> phone<00:06:30.540> really<00:06:30.960> I<00:06:30.990> think<00:06:31.230> it's<00:06:31.320> more<00:06:31.380> of<00:06:31.620> a

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
big phone really I think it's more of a

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.440 
big phone really I think it's more of a
tablet<00:06:32.040> than<00:06:32.160> a<00:06:32.250> phone<00:06:32.460> it's<00:06:33.090> not<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> most

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
tablet than a phone it's not the most

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.940 
tablet than a phone it's not the most
comfortable<00:06:33.690> thing<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.140> carry<00:06:34.380> around<00:06:34.470> if

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
comfortable thing to carry around if

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.920 
comfortable thing to carry around if
carried<00:06:35.730> in<00:06:35.820> the<00:06:35.940> vertical<00:06:36.210> position<00:06:36.450> they

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
carried in the vertical position they

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.279 
carried in the vertical position they
can<00:06:37.050> kind

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
a huge fan of belt clip but the overall

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.179 
a huge fan of belt clip but the overall
curve<00:06:45.300> is<00:06:45.539> nice<00:06:46.289> that<00:06:46.499> will<00:06:46.619> kind<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:46.800> contour

because it is so large it's not the most
