we're going to be against navy kenan and
a<00:01:17.719> Lulu<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.609> where<00:01:19.609> runes<00:01:19.939> and<00:01:20.030> masteries<00:01:20.119> I

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
a Lulu and where runes and masteries I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.480 
a Lulu and where runes and masteries I
use<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.749> pretty<00:01:21.170> standard<00:01:21.679> the<00:01:22.130> only

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
use a pretty standard the only

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.739 
use a pretty standard the only
difference<00:01:22.670> would<00:01:22.939> be<00:01:22.999> that<00:01:23.149> for<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.719> my

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
difference would be that for one of my

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.959 
difference would be that for one of my
Reds<00:01:24.109> I<00:01:24.319> do<00:01:24.380> take<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.799> crit<00:01:25.219> chance<00:01:25.249> rune<00:01:25.819> and

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
Reds I do take a crit chance rune and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.999 
Reds I do take a crit chance rune and
this<00:01:26.299> is<00:01:26.450> simply<00:01:26.719> because<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.590> creek<00:01:27.829> can

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
this is simply because the creek can

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.880 
this is simply because the creek can
really<00:01:28.280> sway<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.700> lane<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.869> your<00:01:30.049> favor<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:30.679> I

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
really sway the lane in your favor and I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.709 
really sway the lane in your favor and I
believe<00:01:31.159> it's<00:01:31.340> worth<00:01:31.520> taking<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.299> less<00:01:32.479> ad

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
believe it's worth taking the less ad

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.319 
believe it's worth taking the less ad
for<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.499> for<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.770> crit<00:01:34.069> chance<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:35.149> in<00:01:35.240> this

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
for that for that crit chance so in this

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.059 
for that for that crit chance so in this
clip<00:01:35.600> I'm<00:01:35.899> just<00:01:36.170> going<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.319> demonstrate<00:01:36.679> how

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
clip I'm just going to demonstrate how

clip I'm just going to demonstrate how
to<00:01:37.100> trade<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.670> how<00:01:37.789> not<00:01:37.999> to<00:01:38.149> trade<00:01:38.359> so<00:01:39.049> as<00:01:39.109> you

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
to trade and how not to trade so as you

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.739 
to trade and how not to trade so as you
see<00:01:39.380> there<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.619> took<00:01:39.829> around<00:01:40.749> twenty-five

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
see there I took around twenty-five

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.649 
see there I took around twenty-five
percent<00:01:41.929> of<00:01:42.229> my<00:01:42.409> life<00:01:42.999> but<00:01:43.999> I<00:01:44.090> do<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:44.359> a<00:01:44.420> sony

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
percent of my life but I do have a sony

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.510 
percent of my life but I do have a sony
to<00:01:44.869> heal<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.139> back<00:01:45.350> up<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.770> Lulu's<00:01:46.130> already

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
to heal that back up and Lulu's already

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.149 
to heal that back up and Lulu's already
on<00:01:46.639> half<00:01:46.939> health<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.350> Kenan<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:48.889> the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
on half health and so is Kenan so the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.050 
on half health and so is Kenan so the
basic<00:01:49.609> combo<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.799> harass<00:01:51.799> in<00:01:52.189> lane<00:01:52.459> as<00:01:52.759> graves

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
basic combo to harass in lane as graves

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.879 
basic combo to harass in lane as graves
is<00:01:53.359> going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.539> be<00:01:53.659> an<00:01:53.780> auto<00:01:53.929> attack<00:01:54.350> instantly

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
is going to be an auto attack instantly

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.830 
is going to be an auto attack instantly
into<00:01:55.459> a<00:01:55.490> queue<00:01:55.789> now<00:01:56.209> it<00:01:56.329> gives<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.630> lot<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
into a queue now it gives you a lot of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.469 
into a queue now it gives you a lot of
damage<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.350> your<00:01:57.950> auto<00:01:58.130> attack<00:01:58.670> range<00:01:59.179> is

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
damage and your auto attack range is

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.270 
damage and your auto attack range is
slightly<00:01:59.810> lower<00:02:00.049> than<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.649> queue<00:02:00.889> meaning

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
slightly lower than the queue meaning

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.669 
slightly lower than the queue meaning
that<00:02:01.459> even<00:02:01.969> if<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.240> NMA<00:02:02.509> ad<00:02:02.719> walks<00:02:02.990> back<00:02:03.289> after

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
that even if the NMA ad walks back after

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.349 
that even if the NMA ad walks back after
the<00:02:03.770> auto<00:02:03.889> attack<00:02:04.280> your<00:02:04.549> queue<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.029> most

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
the auto attack your queue is most

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.179 
the auto attack your queue is most
likely<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.109> hit<00:02:06.350> him<00:02:06.529> the<00:02:07.069> other

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
likely going to hit him the other

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.040 
likely going to hit him the other
mechanic<00:02:07.670> which<00:02:07.789> works<00:02:08.030> across<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.539> board<00:02:08.780> is

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
mechanic which works across the board is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.949 
mechanic which works across the board is
looking<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:10.039> your<00:02:10.280> minions<00:02:10.640> health<00:02:10.880> now<00:02:11.420> when

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
looking at your minions health now when

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.530 
looking at your minions health now when
the<00:02:12.319> enemy<00:02:12.620> ad<00:02:12.770> comes<00:02:13.220> up<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.580> last<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:14.030> all

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
the enemy ad comes up to last here all

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
the enemy ad comes up to last here all
you<00:02:14.750> need<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.020> do<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.200> attack<00:02:15.680> him<00:02:15.950> he's<00:02:16.520> not

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
you need to do is attack him he's not

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.789 
you need to do is attack him he's not
going<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.030> attack<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.269> back<00:02:17.629> nine<00:02:18.290> times<00:02:18.590> out

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
going to attack you back nine times out

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.199 
going to attack you back nine times out
of<00:02:18.830> 10<00:02:19.099> because<00:02:19.280> he's<00:02:19.640> trying<00:02:19.909> to<00:02:20.000> get<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
of 10 because he's trying to get that

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.759 
of 10 because he's trying to get that
last<00:02:20.269> hit<00:02:20.629> which<00:02:20.900> means<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.409> get<00:02:21.590> some

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
last hit which means you just get some

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:22.059 
last hit which means you just get some

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
free

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.309 
free
ass<00:02:22.219> and<00:02:22.579> then<00:02:22.909> you<00:02:22.999> come<00:02:23.180> back<00:02:23.209> off<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
ass and then you come back off as you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.780 
ass and then you come back off as you
can<00:02:24.499> see<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> lot<00:02:25.249> easier<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.609> do<00:02:25.760> when

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
can see this is a lot easier to do when

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.879 
can see this is a lot easier to do when
the<00:02:26.030> enemy<00:02:26.329> ad<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.719> under<00:02:26.989> is<00:02:27.109> tower<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.680> he's

the enemy ad is under is tower and he's
one<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.219> reasons<00:02:28.519> why<00:02:28.639> pushing<00:02:28.999> Ali<00:02:29.150> can

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
one of the reasons why pushing Ali can

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.209 
one of the reasons why pushing Ali can

the wave so as you can see there I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.009 
the wave so as you can see there I
walked<00:02:49.669> up<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:50.030> Kenan<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.510> trade<00:02:50.750> with<00:02:50.900> him

could apply that and use his WF extra
damage<00:02:58.040> no<00:02:58.579> not<00:02:58.760> only<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.239> when<00:02:59.599> he

damage no not only that but when he

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.420 
damage no not only that but when he
started<00:02:59.780> talking<00:03:00.439> why<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> wanted<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.189> trade

and show you this again at this point in

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.140

time<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.410> enemy<00:06:03.620> team<00:06:03.800> can't<00:06:04.160> see<00:06:04.400> Sona<00:06:04.729> so<00:06:05.060> it

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
time the enemy team can't see Sona so it

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.219 
time the enemy team can't see Sona so it
means<00:06:05.270> i<00:06:05.450> can<00:06:05.570> go<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.720> little<00:06:05.840> bit<00:06:06.050> more

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
means i can go a little bit more

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.750 
means i can go a little bit more
aggressive<00:06:06.289> and<00:06:06.770> get<00:06:06.950> some<00:06:07.099> good<00:06:07.250> damage<00:06:07.580> on

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
aggressive and get some good damage on

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.360 
aggressive and get some good damage on
to<00:06:08.030> Kenan<00:06:08.360> now<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.169> so<00:06:09.380> neural<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:09.770> really

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
to Kenan now this so neural is really

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.219 
to Kenan now this so neural is really
good<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:10.669> gets<00:06:11.150> both<00:06:11.389> of<00:06:11.630> them<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:12.050> if<00:06:12.139> I

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
good this gets both of them and if I

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.719 
good this gets both of them and if I
instantly<00:06:12.590> are<00:06:12.800> here<00:06:13.070> he<00:06:13.220> would<00:06:13.430> have<00:06:13.520> died

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
instantly are here he would have died

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.000 
instantly are here he would have died
now<00:06:14.599> as<00:06:14.720> you<00:06:14.750> notice<00:06:15.169> he<00:06:15.349> actually<00:06:15.470> gets<00:06:15.770> hit

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
now as you notice he actually gets hit

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.920 
now as you notice he actually gets hit
by<00:06:16.039> the<00:06:16.190> second<00:06:16.639> part<00:06:16.849> of<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.240> graves<00:06:17.450> old<00:06:17.750> and

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
by the second part of the graves old and

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.140 
by the second part of the graves old and
so<00:06:18.289> if<00:06:18.470> I<00:06:18.620> died<00:06:18.889> instantly<00:06:19.580> while<00:06:19.700> he<00:06:20.060> was

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
so if I died instantly while he was

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.730 
so if I died instantly while he was
still<00:06:20.389> stunned<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:21.200> would<00:06:21.349> have<00:06:21.440> been<00:06:21.500> hit<00:06:21.650> by

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
still stunned it would have been hit by

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.560 
still stunned it would have been hit by
both<00:06:21.979> parts<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.580> he<00:06:22.639> would<00:06:22.789> have<00:06:22.910> died<00:06:23.090> now

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
both parts and he would have died now

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.089 
both parts and he would have died now
you<00:06:23.630> could<00:06:23.960> argue<00:06:23.990> that<00:06:24.320> he<00:06:24.530> did<00:06:24.680> Bernie's

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
you could argue that he did Bernie's

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.740 
you could argue that he did Bernie's
cleanse<00:06:25.430> and<00:06:25.729> his<00:06:25.849> flash<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.330> get<00:06:26.479> away<00:06:26.570> from

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
cleanse and his flash to get away from

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.540 
cleanse and his flash to get away from
that<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.260> his<00:06:27.590> cleanse<00:06:27.889> is<00:06:28.070> something<00:06:28.400> that<00:06:28.460> I

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
that and his cleanse is something that I

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.250 
that and his cleanse is something that I
can't<00:06:28.849> really<00:06:29.060> help<00:06:29.330> but<00:06:29.570> it<00:06:29.690> removes<00:06:30.050> the

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
can't really help but it removes the

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.440 
can't really help but it removes the
sonor<00:06:30.530> ol<00:06:30.710> however<00:06:31.370> his<00:06:31.490> reaction<00:06:32.000> time<00:06:32.240> was

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
sonor ol however his reaction time was

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.080 
sonor ol however his reaction time was
so<00:06:32.690> slow<00:06:33.110> that<00:06:33.139> it<00:06:33.470> meant<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:33.860> actually<00:06:34.550> if<00:06:34.880> I

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
so slow that it meant that actually if I

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.870 
so slow that it meant that actually if I
died<00:06:35.360> instantly<00:06:35.960> he<00:06:36.620> would<00:06:36.830> have<00:06:36.919> died<00:06:37.130> now

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
died instantly he would have died now

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.950 
died instantly he would have died now
