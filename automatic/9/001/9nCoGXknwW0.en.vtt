night<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.610> found<00:00:44.330> a<00:00:44.450> good<00:00:45.340> candidate<00:00:46.340> for<00:00:46.520> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
night and I found a good candidate for a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.610 
night and I found a good candidate for a
piece<00:00:46.820> of<00:00:47.000> steel<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.920> it's<00:00:49.760> approximately

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
piece of steel and it's approximately

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.619 
piece of steel and it's approximately
two-and-a-half<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:52.250> three<00:00:52.520> feet<00:00:52.550> long<00:00:55.480> as<00:00:56.480> you

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
two-and-a-half to three feet long as you

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.370 
two-and-a-half to three feet long as you
can<00:00:56.750> see<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.140> blade<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:58.780> pretty<00:00:59.780> thick

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
can see this blade is pretty thick

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.270 
can see this blade is pretty thick
I<00:01:01.630> believe<00:01:02.630> it's<00:01:02.840> five<00:01:03.260> millimeters<00:01:03.950> thick

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
I believe it's five millimeters thick

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.040 
I believe it's five millimeters thick
and<00:01:05.020> I<00:01:06.020> think<00:01:06.800> it's<00:01:06.890> almost<00:01:07.160> like<00:01:07.369> like<00:01:08.090> 3/16

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
and I think it's almost like like 3/16

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.190 
and I think it's almost like like 3/16
of<00:01:09.170> an<00:01:09.259> inch

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.399 

yeah<00:01:12.799> I'm<00:01:12.950> pretty<00:01:13.100> sure<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:13.460> like<00:01:13.640> 36<00:01:14.409> 3/16

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
yeah I'm pretty sure it's like 36 3/16

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.300 
yeah I'm pretty sure it's like 36 3/16
of<00:01:15.560> an<00:01:15.650> inch<00:01:15.799> thick<00:01:16.220> brick<00:01:17.150> thick<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.979> pretty

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
of an inch thick brick thick it's pretty

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.359 
of an inch thick brick thick it's pretty
heavy-duty<00:01:19.610> piece<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.180> steel<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:24.369> would

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
heavy-duty piece of steel and I would

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.330 
heavy-duty piece of steel and I would
suggest<00:01:25.549> starting<00:01:26.299> out<00:01:26.930> if<00:01:27.470> you're<00:01:27.710> gonna

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
suggest starting out if you're gonna

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.950 
suggest starting out if you're gonna
make<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.610> knife<00:01:28.850> make<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.420> own<00:01:29.539> knife<00:01:31.960> taking

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
make a knife make your own knife taking

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.510 
make a knife make your own knife taking
measure<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.350> out<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.770> length<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.220> want

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
measure it out the length that you want

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.410 
measure it out the length that you want
and<00:01:36.250> take<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.430> draw<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.640> couple<00:01:38.060> different

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and take and draw a couple different

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.510 
and take and draw a couple different
designs<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.439> kind<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.189> way<00:01:40.340> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
designs to get it kind of the way that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.789 
designs to get it kind of the way that
you<00:01:40.670> like<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.149> as<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.320> can<00:01:42.439> see<00:01:42.619> I've

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
you like it as you can see I've

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.130 
you like it as you can see I've
experimented<00:01:43.520> with<00:01:43.939> about<00:01:44.810> two<00:01:44.990> or<00:01:45.080> three

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
experimented with about two or three

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.529 
experimented with about two or three
different<00:01:47.350> designs<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.450> first<00:01:50.450> thing

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
different designs here and first thing

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.590 
different designs here and first thing
I'm<00:01:50.750> going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:52.090> cut<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> thing<00:01:53.450> to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
I'm going to do is a cut this thing to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.680 
I'm going to do is a cut this thing to
length<00:01:53.840> I'm<00:01:54.679> gonna<00:01:54.880> cut<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:55.909> right<00:01:56.179> there<00:01:56.479> at

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
length I'm gonna cut it right there at

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.760 
length I'm gonna cut it right there at
the<00:01:56.780> bottom<00:01:57.159> straight<00:01:58.159> down<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.560> right<00:02:00.560> there

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
the bottom straight down and right there

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.010 
the bottom straight down and right there
at<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.580> end<00:02:01.819> of<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.030> blade<00:02:02.209> just<00:02:02.479> right<00:02:02.840> now

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
at that end of the blade just right now

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.730 
at that end of the blade just right now
and<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:05.630> gonna<00:02:05.780> go<00:02:05.959> put<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.289> in<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.560> vise

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and I'm gonna go put this in the vise

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.270 
and I'm gonna go put this in the vise
and<00:02:07.130> then<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:09.019> gonna<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.530> cut<00:02:09.739> down<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and then I'm gonna get that cut down and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.900 
and then I'm gonna get that cut down and
we'll<00:02:11.209> get<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.390> little<00:02:11.540> more<00:02:11.780> footage<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:13.790> how

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
we'll get a little more footage see how

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.520 
we'll get a little more footage see how
this<00:02:14.120> thing<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:15.560> turns<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:17.530> normally

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
this thing thing turns out here normally

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.819 
this thing thing turns out here normally
I<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.190> wing<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:20.170> kind<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.290> got<00:02:21.739> an

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
I just kind of wing it I kind of got an

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.390 
I just kind of wing it I kind of got an
idea<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> design<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.970> want<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:24.400> I'm

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
idea of the design that I want and I'm

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920 
idea of the design that I want and I'm
just<00:02:25.579> gonna<00:02:25.730> start<00:02:25.970> grinding<00:02:26.269> when<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.660> start

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
just gonna start grinding when I start

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.270 
just gonna start grinding when I start
shaping<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.320> blade<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:29.739> however<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.070> goes

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
shaping the blade and however it goes

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880 
shaping the blade and however it goes
with<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.209> contours<00:02:32.690> whatever<00:02:33.320> while<00:02:33.769> I'm

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
with the contours whatever while I'm

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.130 
with the contours whatever while I'm
making<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.340> that's<00:02:34.579> just<00:02:35.030> how<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:35.959> going<00:02:36.079> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
making it that's just how it's going to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.670 
making it that's just how it's going to
turn<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.680> may<00:02:36.890> not<00:02:37.040> exactly<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:38.680> exactly

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
turn out it may not exactly be exactly

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.030 
turn out it may not exactly be exactly
you<00:02:40.040> know<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:41.390> shape<00:02:41.690> I'm<00:02:42.440> not<00:02:42.650> too<00:02:42.799> sure

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
you know this the shape I'm not too sure

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
you know this the shape I'm not too sure
but<00:02:44.320> I'll<00:02:45.320> get<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.560> grinding<00:02:46.010> move

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
but I'll get to grinding move

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.750 
but I'll get to grinding move
we'll<00:02:48.320> check<00:02:48.500> her<00:02:48.680> out<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.400> right<00:02:49.610> here

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
we'll check her out is this right here

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.140 
we'll check her out is this right here
it's<00:02:49.940> gonna<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:51.070> kind<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.310> what<00:02:53.030> its

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
it's gonna be kind of like what its

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.600 
it's gonna be kind of like what its
gonna<00:02:53.240> look<00:02:53.360> like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.690 

if<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.240> not<00:02:58.420> mistaken<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:59.020> think<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.740> 15

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
if I'm not mistaken I think this is a 15

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.320 
if I'm not mistaken I think this is a 15
or<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.910> 16<00:03:01.420> inch<00:03:01.630> blade<00:03:03.090> pretty<00:03:04.090> heavy-duty

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
or a 16 inch blade pretty heavy-duty

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.690 
or a 16 inch blade pretty heavy-duty
piece<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.870> steel

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.559 

okay<00:03:10.450> my<00:03:10.720> next<00:03:10.780> step<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.030> when<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
okay my next step is I want to when I

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.850 
okay my next step is I want to when I
start<00:03:13.870> cutting<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.380> want<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.709> make<00:03:14.830> sure

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
start cutting it I want to make sure

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.960 
start cutting it I want to make sure
that<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.500> securely<00:03:17.500> mounted<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.819> my

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
that I have it securely mounted to my

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.840 
that I have it securely mounted to my
bench<00:03:19.180> top<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.860> I've<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.220> got<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.490> clamped

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
bench top and I've just got it clamped

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.100 
bench top and I've just got it clamped
down<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.730> ought<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.910> keep<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.780> from<00:03:25.930> moving

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
down that ought to keep it from moving

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.170 
down that ought to keep it from moving
while<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.530> trying<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.830> cut<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.670> after<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.120> get

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
while I'm trying to cut and after I get

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.690 
while I'm trying to cut and after I get
this<00:03:28.450> end<00:03:28.660> cut<00:03:28.930> off<00:03:29.050> here<00:03:29.380> I'll<00:03:30.130> go<00:03:30.430> ahead<00:03:30.490> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
this end cut off here I'll go ahead and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.120 
this end cut off here I'll go ahead and
swap<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.209> around<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.840> I'll<00:03:32.740> cut<00:03:33.010> it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
swap this around and I'll cut it

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.120 
swap this around and I'll cut it
straight<00:03:33.340> across<00:03:34.110> by<00:03:35.110> where<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.440> tip<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
straight across by where the tip is and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.220 
straight across by where the tip is and
I'm<00:03:39.610> gonna<00:03:39.790> get<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.120> thing<00:03:40.330> cut<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.810> I'll<00:03:41.110> be

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
I'm gonna get this thing cut and I'll be

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.370 
I'm gonna get this thing cut and I'll be
right<00:03:41.380> back<00:03:43.320> okay<00:03:44.320> now<00:03:44.620> we've<00:03:45.220> got<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.380> basic

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
right back okay now we've got the basic

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.890 
right back okay now we've got the basic
shape<00:03:47.430> trimmed<00:03:48.430> out<00:03:48.640> it's<00:03:49.150> real<00:03:49.390> primitive

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
shape trimmed out it's real primitive

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.970 
shape trimmed out it's real primitive
and<00:03:50.580> our<00:03:51.580> next<00:03:51.970> step<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.720> I'm<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.830> take

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
and our next step is I'm going to take

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.470 
and our next step is I'm going to take
this<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:55.709> bench<00:03:56.709> top<00:03:56.950> grinder<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.700> I'm

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
this to the bench top grinder and I'm

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.420 
this to the bench top grinder and I'm
gonna<00:03:58.630> start<00:03:59.050> smoothing<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.950> edges<00:03:59.980> down

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
gonna start smoothing the edges down

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.990 
gonna start smoothing the edges down
where<00:04:00.670> it's<00:04:00.790> been<00:04:00.970> cut<00:04:01.239> you<00:04:02.170> see<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.620> is

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
where it's been cut you see this is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.020 
where it's been cut you see this is
pretty<00:04:04.000> primitive

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.980 

not<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.840> round<00:04:08.290> these<00:04:08.530> up<00:04:09.360> round<00:04:10.360> those<00:04:10.630> out

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
not to round these up round those out

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.229 
not to round these up round those out
right<00:04:11.760> there<00:04:12.760> there<00:04:13.560> there<00:04:14.880> same<00:04:15.880> thing<00:04:16.090> with

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
right there there there same thing with

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.140 
right there there there same thing with
the<00:04:16.329> edges<00:04:16.660> up<00:04:16.840> here<00:04:17.109> round<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.769> out<00:04:18.150> round

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
the edges up here round that out round

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.470 
the edges up here round that out round
this<00:04:19.359> out<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:21.330> might<00:04:22.330> take<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.600> little<00:04:23.500> bit<00:04:23.650> off

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
this out I might take a little bit off

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.830 
this out I might take a little bit off
through<00:04:25.480> here<00:04:26.430> what<00:04:27.430> kind<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.670> matches<00:04:28.060> this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:55.939 

but<00:04:33.530> it's<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.190> start

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
well I started working down a little bit

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.770 
well I started working down a little bit
on<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.130> bench<00:05:14.850> top<00:05:15.060> grinder<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:17.750> did<00:05:18.750> a

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
on the bench top grinder and I did a

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.520 
on the bench top grinder and I did a
little<00:05:19.080> bit<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.650> sanding<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:21.110> I'm<00:05:22.110> gonna<00:05:22.259> call

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
little bit of sanding and I'm gonna call

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.090 
little bit of sanding and I'm gonna call
it<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.740> day<00:05:22.770> for<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.729> episode<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:25.100> hopefully

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
it a day for this episode and hopefully

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.650 
it a day for this episode and hopefully
I'll<00:05:26.460> be<00:05:26.490> posting<00:05:26.820> another<00:05:27.979> video<00:05:29.479> with<00:05:30.479> him
