when<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.610> suck<00:02:40.939> at<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:48.010> alright<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.159> I<00:02:49.189> can't<00:02:49.400> get

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
when I suck at it alright so I can't get

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.740 
when I suck at it alright so I can't get
past<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.909> hammer<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.420> should<00:02:50.689> go

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
past the hammer out there I should go

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.539 
past the hammer out there I should go

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
out of the next game so alright so if I

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.309 
out of the next game so alright so if I
had<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.670> guess<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.000> played<00:02:53.209> three<00:02:53.989> games<00:02:54.019> in

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
had to guess I played three games in

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.869 
had to guess I played three games in
there<00:02:54.439> that's<00:02:54.590> probably<00:02:54.680> only<00:02:54.920> four<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.790> this

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
there that's probably only four so this

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.339 
there that's probably only four so this
is<00:02:56.030> number<00:02:56.360> two<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.720> probably<00:02:56.959> only<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.140> form

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
is number two it's probably only a form

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.170 
is number two it's probably only a form
we're<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:57.739> too<00:02:57.980> which<00:02:58.610> ones<00:02:58.849> they<00:02:59.030> gonna

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
guess Upson on these cartridges you can

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.950 
guess Upson on these cartridges you can
see<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:36.980> actual<00:04:37.250> games<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:37.670> we<00:04:37.790> got<00:04:37.960> skeet

shooting archery and weightlifting two
of<00:04:41.900> which<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.200> recognize<00:04:42.590> from<00:04:42.710> other<00:04:42.890> versions

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
of which I recognize from other versions

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.010 
of which I recognize from other versions
they<00:04:43.430> came<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:43.640> we'll<00:04:44.180> see<00:04:44.360> uh<00:04:44.390> looks<00:04:44.930> like

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
they came so we'll see uh looks like

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.230 
they came so we'll see uh looks like
there's<00:04:45.140> only<00:04:45.170> three<00:04:45.880> maybe<00:04:46.880> it's<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.030> space

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240
