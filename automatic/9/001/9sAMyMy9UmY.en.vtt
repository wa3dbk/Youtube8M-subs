pin son you are you don't want to cram
it<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.200> there<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> friction<00:02:49.430> fit<00:02:49.640> so

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
it in there but it is a friction fit so

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.060 
it in there but it is a friction fit so
it<00:02:49.940> needs<00:02:50.150> some<00:02:50.330> pressure<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.750> fit<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.860> ball

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070

through<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.380> tuning<00:03:18.980> post<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.180> need<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
through the tuning post but you need to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.319 
through the tuning post but you need to
leave<00:03:20.660> some<00:03:20.930> slacks<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.650> do<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.209> need<00:03:23.209> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.940 
it across my poem my problems about
three<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.120> half<00:03:32.180> inches<00:03:32.450> wide<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.320> I'll

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
three and a half inches wide here I'll

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.229 
three and a half inches wide here I'll
run<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.280> across<00:03:34.370> my<00:03:34.610> poem<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:37.030> hold<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.209> in

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
post and I like to have the post run

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.890 
post and I like to have the post run
alone<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.030> direction<00:03:56.239> within<00:03:56.660> that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
alone all in this direction within that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.229 
alone all in this direction within that
greater<00:03:57.170> than<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.440> cross<00:03:57.769> some<00:03:58.670> people<00:03:58.970> do<00:03:59.120> it

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
greater than a cross some people do it

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.060 
greater than a cross some people do it
the<00:03:59.360> other<00:03:59.390> way<00:03:59.600> but<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.989> prefer<00:04:00.350> this<00:04:00.530> way<00:04:00.769> I'll

that comes out of the far side of the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.710 
that comes out of the far side of the
post<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.250> bend<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.460> toward<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.300> center<00:04:11.570> of

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
post and bend it in toward the center of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.500 
post and bend it in toward the center of
the<00:04:11.810> headstock<00:04:12.550> okay<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.610> kind<00:04:13.910> of<00:04:14.000> crimp<00:04:14.300> it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
the headstock okay you kind of crimp it

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.620 
the headstock okay you kind of crimp it
then<00:04:15.170> you're<00:04:15.290> going<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.470> take<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.950> friend

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
then you're going to take that friend

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.830 
then you're going to take that friend
and<00:04:17.630> run<00:04:18.020> it<00:04:18.200> under<00:04:19.210> the<00:04:20.920> string<00:04:21.920> and<00:04:22.840> you're

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
with a big wad of it it makes it harder

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.210 
with a big wad of it it makes it harder
to<00:05:22.880> tune<00:05:23.210> like<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:24.620> maintain<00:05:24.890> your

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
to tune like that so you maintain your

to tune like that so you maintain your
pressure<00:05:25.700> on<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.060> string<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:28.960> I'm<00:05:29.960> gonna

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
pressure on the string and you I'm gonna

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.650 
pressure on the string and you I'm gonna
string<00:05:30.530> them<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.070> post<00:05:31.340> okay<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.240> think

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
string them to the post okay I think

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.380 
string them to the post okay I think
I've<00:05:32.870> gotten<00:05:33.080> my<00:05:33.380> three<00:05:33.770> turns<00:05:34.400> there<00:05:34.760> then

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
I've gotten my three turns there then

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.670 
I've gotten my three turns there then
check<00:05:35.720> your<00:05:35.930> tuning
