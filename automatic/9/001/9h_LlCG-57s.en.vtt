00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
like five hours and 59 minutes then it's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
like five hours and 59 minutes then it's
five<00:01:07.409> life<00:01:07.680> points<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> still<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> Life

five life points is still a lot of Life
Points<00:01:09.710> but<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.700> faster<00:01:12.180> than<00:01:12.720> like

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Points but it's a lot faster than like

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.310 
Points but it's a lot faster than like
waiting<00:01:13.680> until<00:01:14.210> tomorrow<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.540> something<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
waiting until tomorrow or something so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.899 
waiting until tomorrow or something so

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
that is probably what I am going to do

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
that is probably what I am going to do
so<00:01:20.909> after<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.479> 15<00:01:22.350> minutes<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.400> what
