diamond Spearfish over 100 feet deep
I've<00:00:17.920> shot<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.310> fish<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:18.820> a<00:00:18.880> hundred<00:00:19.150> nade<00:00:19.300> feet

I've shot a fish and a hundred nade feet

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.920 
I've shot a fish and a hundred nade feet
before<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:21.369> can<00:00:21.820> break<00:00:22.000> it<00:00:22.180> down<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.660> three

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
before and I can break it down to three

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.730 
before and I can break it down to three
main<00:00:23.700> aspects<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:25.000> would<00:00:25.810> say<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.140> comes<00:00:26.590> down

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
main aspects I would say it comes down

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.870 
main aspects I would say it comes down
to<00:00:27.130> preparation<00:00:28.560> confidence<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.950> relaxation

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
to preparation confidence and relaxation

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.020 
to preparation confidence and relaxation
now<00:00:31.390> preparation<00:00:32.110> when<00:00:32.260> I<00:00:32.290> say<00:00:32.500> this<00:00:32.680> I<00:00:32.890> mean

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
now preparation when I say this I mean

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.790 
now preparation when I say this I mean
in<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.150> build<00:00:34.360> up<00:00:34.449> towards<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:34.870> dive<00:00:35.080> you<00:00:35.620> want

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
in the build up towards a dive you want

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.160 
in the build up towards a dive you want
to<00:00:36.010> really<00:00:36.760> do<00:00:37.000> your<00:00:37.120> best<00:00:37.330> to<00:00:37.480> saturate<00:00:38.020> your

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
to really do your best to saturate your

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.650 
to really do your best to saturate your
blood<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.440> oxygen<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.520> take<00:00:39.790> ample<00:00:40.270> time<00:00:40.480> on

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
blood of oxygen and take ample time on

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.240 
blood of oxygen and take ample time on
the<00:00:40.750> surface<00:00:40.960> between<00:00:41.500> dives<00:00:41.769> to<00:00:42.040> really

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
the surface between dives to really

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.759 
the surface between dives to really
recover<00:00:42.610> sometimes<00:00:43.390> your<00:00:44.080> body<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.500> going<00:00:44.650> to

recover sometimes your body is going to

recover sometimes your body is going to
pretend<00:00:45.100> don't<00:00:45.430> think<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:45.790> needs<00:00:45.910> air<00:00:46.360> which

pretend don't think it needs air which

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.170 
pretend don't think it needs air which
is<00:00:47.530> just<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.800> sign<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.040> high<00:00:48.309> carbon<00:00:48.610> dioxide

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
is just a sign of high carbon dioxide

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.880 
is just a sign of high carbon dioxide

actually<00:01:59.170> feel<00:01:59.620> my<00:01:59.860> heart<00:02:00.070> slowing<00:02:00.400> down

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.009 

breathing<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:08.969> this<00:02:08.999> and<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.450> Paden<00:02:09.749> between

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
breathing like this and it Paden between

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.690 
breathing like this and it Paden between
dives<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.439> think<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.859> helps<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:14.459> want<00:02:14.609> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
dives I think really helps you want to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.129 
dives I think really helps you want to
make<00:02:14.819> sure<00:02:14.999> you<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:15.239> overexert<00:02:15.959> yourself

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.139 
make sure you don't overexert yourself

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.110 
make sure you don't overexert yourself
in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> beginning<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.249> dive<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.999> when

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
in the beginning of the dive so when

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630 
in the beginning of the dive so when
you're<00:02:18.239> coming<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.019> you're<00:02:19.109> descending

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
you're coming down and you're descending

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.039 
you're coming down and you're descending
kick<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.909> enough<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.299> where<00:02:22.420> negatively

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
kick just enough to where negatively

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.020 
kick just enough to where negatively
bought<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.409> so<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.680> start<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> sink<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.730> then

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
bought it so we start to sink and then

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.720 
bought it so we start to sink and then
don't<00:02:25.750> rush<00:02:26.079> things<00:02:26.409> just<00:02:26.799> relax<00:02:27.159> and<00:02:27.459> allow

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
don't rush things just relax and allow

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.640 
don't rush things just relax and allow
yourself<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.450> pick<00:02:28.719> up<00:02:28.870> speed<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.439> just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
yourself to pick up speed is you just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.240 
yourself to pick up speed is you just
free<00:02:30.010> fall<00:02:30.280> down<00:02:30.609> to<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.909> bottom<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.359> glide

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
free fall down to the bottom just glide

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
free fall down to the bottom just glide
it's<00:02:33.250> uh<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:34.120> feels<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.569> you're<00:02:34.719> flying

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it's uh it feels like you're flying

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.440 
it's uh it feels like you're flying
almost<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.099> then<00:02:36.189> you<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.299> almost

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
almost in just and then you can almost

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.869 
almost in just and then you can almost
 a<00:02:37.959> fin<00:02:38.290> out<00:02:38.439> and<00:02:38.829> you'll<00:02:39.040> freefall<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.790> a

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
 a fin out and you'll freefall on a

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.449 
 a fin out and you'll freefall on a
spiral<00:02:40.239> which<00:02:40.659> will<00:02:40.900> allow<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.109> see<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.220> full

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
spiral which will allow you see the full

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.880 
spiral which will allow you see the full
view<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.879> bottom<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.299> comes<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
view of the bottom as it comes in to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.220 
view of the bottom as it comes in to
view<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.879> pick<00:02:46.720> any<00:02:46.870> point<00:02:47.170> of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
view and then you can pick any point of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.929 
view and then you can pick any point of
interest<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.889> just<00:02:47.920> slightly<00:02:48.370> arch<00:02:48.700> your

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
interest and just slightly arch your

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.970 
interest and just slightly arch your
back<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.659> your<00:02:49.840> core<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.109> direct<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:50.950> where

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
back use your core to direct you where

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.970 
back use your core to direct you where
you<00:02:51.250> want<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.459> free<00:02:51.639> fall<00:02:51.849> towards<00:02:52.859> saves<00:02:53.859> a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
you want to free fall towards saves a

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
you want to free fall towards saves a
lot<00:02:54.129> of<00:02:54.220> oxygen<00:02:54.370> precious<00:02:55.329> oxygen<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
lot of oxygen precious oxygen to that

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.080 
lot of oxygen precious oxygen to that
depth<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> lot<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.669> people<00:03:03.909> make<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
depth now a lot of people make the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.729 
depth now a lot of people make the
mistakes<00:03:04.569> when<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:04.840> try<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.079> swim<00:03:05.319> down<00:03:05.530> that

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
mistakes when they try to swim down that

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.500 
mistakes when they try to swim down that
end<00:03:05.889> up<00:03:06.040> swimming<00:03:06.250> diagonally<00:03:07.000> because<00:03:07.329> their

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
end up swimming diagonally because their

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.210 
end up swimming diagonally because their
head<00:03:07.689> is<00:03:07.810> up<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.530> then<00:03:08.680> looking<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.129> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
head is up and then looking for the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.920 
head is up and then looking for the
bottom<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.090> when<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.239> want<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.510> swim<00:03:10.720> that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
bottom so when you want to swim that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.420 
bottom so when you want to swim that
make<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.139> dive<00:03:11.409> you<00:03:11.620> want<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.829> make<00:03:11.950> sure<00:03:11.980> your

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
make a dive you want to make sure your

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.119 
make a dive you want to make sure your
diving<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:12.970> short<00:03:13.359> a<00:03:13.510> distance<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.019> possible

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
diving is short a distance as possible

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.009 
diving is short a distance as possible
so<00:03:15.129> you<00:03:15.189> wanna<00:03:15.310> dive<00:03:15.549> straight<00:03:15.909> down<00:03:16.389> and<00:03:16.930> a

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
so you wanna dive straight down and a

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.509 
so you wanna dive straight down and a
good<00:03:17.169> way<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.349> check<00:03:17.439> this<00:03:17.799> is<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.340> look

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
good way to check this is just to look

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.699 
good way to check this is just to look
down<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.689> when<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.900> look<00:03:20.109> down<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.530> should

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
down and when you look down you should

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.319 
down and when you look down you should
be<00:03:20.739> seeing<00:03:21.129> light<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.730> should<00:03:21.909> be<00:03:21.970> seeing<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
be seeing light you should be seeing the

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.830 
be seeing light you should be seeing the
surface<00:03:22.680> straight<00:03:23.680> down<00:03:23.950> behind<00:03:24.189> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.339 

you<00:03:28.840> should<00:03:29.019> take<00:03:29.970> twice<00:03:30.970> or<00:03:31.390> three<00:03:31.840> times<00:03:31.870> as

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
you should take twice or three times as

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.440 
you should take twice or three times as
long<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.890> surface<00:03:33.280> breathing<00:03:33.790> between

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
long on the surface breathing between

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.300 
long on the surface breathing between
dives<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.019> be<00:03:35.140> safe<00:03:35.379> I'm<00:03:35.950> gonna<00:03:36.069> make<00:03:36.280> sure

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
dives to be safe I'm gonna make sure

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
dives to be safe I'm gonna make sure
that<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.879> fully<00:03:37.269> recovered<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.989> fully

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
that you fully recovered you fully

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.050 
that you fully recovered you fully
exchanged<00:03:38.830> all<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.220> gases<00:03:39.610> in<00:03:39.730> your<00:03:39.879> blood

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
exchanged all the gases in your blood

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.880 
exchanged all the gases in your blood
and<00:03:40.269> you're<00:03:40.659> fresh<00:03:40.900> again<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.319> go<00:03:41.440> down<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
and you're fresh again to go down to the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.710 
and you're fresh again to go down to the
bottom<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:42.549> never<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:42.940> good<00:03:43.030> idea<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:43.540> this

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
bottom it's never a good idea to do this

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.449 
bottom it's never a good idea to do this
alone<00:03:43.989> when<00:03:44.319> you're<00:03:44.440> doing<00:03:44.739> deep<00:03:44.920> dives<00:03:45.190> it's

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
alone when you're doing deep dives it's

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.970 
alone when you're doing deep dives it's
always<00:03:45.909> good<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.720> have<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> buddy<00:03:47.110> system<00:03:47.349> so

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
always good to have a buddy system so

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.259 
always good to have a buddy system so
when<00:03:48.099> you're<00:03:48.250> diving<00:03:48.519> down<00:03:48.849> at<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.120> bottom

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
when you're diving down at the bottom

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.149 
when you're diving down at the bottom
your<00:03:49.690> buddy's<00:03:50.019> breathing<00:03:50.560> up<00:03:50.680> on<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.920> surface

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
your buddy's breathing up on the surface

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.819 
your buddy's breathing up on the surface
and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.180> switch<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.140> if<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.560> were<00:03:53.680> to
