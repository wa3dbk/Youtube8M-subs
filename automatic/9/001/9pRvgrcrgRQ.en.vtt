out very often at all mainly because at
our<00:00:43.649> rain<00:00:43.890> gutters<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> strainer<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
our rain gutters we have a strainer to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.389 
our rain gutters we have a strainer to
filter<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.930> leaves<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> debris<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> twigs

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
filter out leaves and debris and twigs

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.080 
filter out leaves and debris and twigs
and<00:00:47.579> stuff<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> first<00:00:48.780> flush

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
and stuff and then we have a first flush

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
and stuff and then we have a first flush
we<00:00:51.090> also<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> strainer<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.129> tank

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
we also have a strainer at the tank

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.850 
we also have a strainer at the tank
Inlet<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.780> itself<00:00:55.230> you'll<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
Inlet at the top itself you'll see that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.400 
Inlet at the top itself you'll see that
another<00:00:56.129> video<00:00:56.420> what<00:00:57.420> we're<00:00:57.660> using<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.170> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
another video what we're using there is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.959 
another video what we're using there is
a<00:00:59.059> heavy-duty<00:01:00.059> pet<00:01:00.480> safe<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.260> pet<00:01:01.500> proof

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
a heavy-duty pet safe or pet proof

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.170 
a heavy-duty pet safe or pet proof
window<00:01:02.969> screening<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:04.650> fiberglass<00:01:05.180> anyway

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
window screening it's fiberglass anyway

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
window screening it's fiberglass anyway
so<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> gets<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.010> point

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so by the time it gets to this point

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
so by the time it gets to this point
here<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> pretty<00:01:09.030> clean<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.840> far<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.170> debris

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
here is pretty clean as far as debris

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.789 
here is pretty clean as far as debris
and<00:01:10.950> such<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> clean<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and such so we don't have to clean that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.550 
and such so we don't have to clean that
out<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.600> about<00:01:15.600> every<00:01:15.869> six<00:01:16.110> months<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
out but about every six months or so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
out but about every six months or so
every<00:01:16.920> four<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> six<00:01:17.250> months<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:18.030> check<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
every four to six months I'll check it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
every four to six months I'll check it
every<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.140> there's<00:01:19.380> hardly

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
every now and then but there's hardly

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.739 
every now and then but there's hardly
ever<00:01:19.770> anything<00:01:20.159> anymore

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
ever anything anymore

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.870 
ever anything anymore
now<00:01:22.140> you're<00:01:22.259> hearing<00:01:22.499> the<00:01:22.590> pump<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.429> it's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
now you're hearing the pump is it's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.830 
now you're hearing the pump is it's
fairly<00:01:24.119> quiet<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> sure<00:01:27.149> flow<00:01:27.420> pump

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
fairly quiet that is a sure flow pump

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.539 
fairly quiet that is a sure flow pump
two<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.319> a<00:01:28.350> half<00:01:28.469> gallon<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.069> minute

two and a half gallon for a minute

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.669 
two and a half gallon for a minute
highly<00:01:30.329> recommended<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.500> good

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
highly recommended a very very good

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.080 
highly recommended a very very good
quality<00:01:31.859> pump<00:01:33.799> we<00:01:34.799> run<00:01:35.009> from<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.609> to<00:01:36.060> our

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
quality pump we run from there to our

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.969 
quality pump we run from there to our

used<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.789> conjunction<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.359> this<00:01:42.719> pressure

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
used in conjunction with this pressure

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
used in conjunction with this pressure
tank<00:01:43.560> I'd<00:01:44.340> highly<00:01:44.609> recommend<00:01:45.319> these<00:01:47.030> little

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
tank I'd highly recommend these little

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870 
tank I'd highly recommend these little
DC<00:01:48.479> pumps<00:01:48.959> I'd<00:01:49.079> failed<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.679> let<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> know

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
DC pumps I'd failed and let you know

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
DC pumps I'd failed and let you know
about<00:01:50.969> that<00:01:51.209> is<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.599> a<00:01:51.630> DC<00:01:52.140> pump<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> runs<00:01:52.770> off

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
about that is this a DC pump it runs off

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
about that is this a DC pump it runs off
our<00:01:53.099> battery<00:01:53.489> bank<00:01:53.729> from<00:01:54.060> our<00:01:54.179> solar<00:01:54.420> energy

our battery bank from our solar energy
system<00:01:56.239> these<00:01:57.239> pumps<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:59.280> work<00:01:59.610> they

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
system these pumps can work they

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
system these pumps can work they
advertise<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:00.869> work<00:02:01.079> without<00:02:01.289> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
advertise that they work without the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.779 
advertise that they work without the
pressure<00:02:01.619> tank<00:02:02.099> but<00:02:02.489> I<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.700> highly

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
pressure tank but I would highly

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.880 
pressure tank but I would highly
recommend<00:02:02.939> getting<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.569> anyway<00:02:04.020> otherwise

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
recommend getting one anyway otherwise

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
recommend getting one anyway otherwise
they'll<00:02:05.280> cycle<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.819> and<00:02:05.939> off<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.360> eventually

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
they'll cycle on and off and eventually

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.979 
they'll cycle on and off and eventually
they<00:02:06.929> can<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.349> hot<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> we've<00:02:09.329> got<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> little

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they can get hot so we've got a little

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.809 
they can get hot so we've got a little
pressure<00:02:10.170> tank<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.679> there

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
pressure tank up there

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.849 
pressure tank up there
you<00:02:12.180> heard<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> kick<00:02:12.660> off<00:02:12.840> basically<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.709> way

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
you heard it kick off basically the way

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.190 
you heard it kick off basically the way
it<00:02:13.950> works<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.609> when<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.879> gets<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.239> can't

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it works is when it gets down to can't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.509 
it works is when it gets down to can't
remember<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.530> set<00:02:16.829> right<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.190> think<00:02:17.400> it's

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
remember or set right now I think it's

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.030 
remember or set right now I think it's
at<00:02:17.640> 15<00:02:18.030> psi<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.890> kicks<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.760> pump<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
at 15 psi it kicks the the pump on and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.270 
at 15 psi it kicks the the pump on and
the<00:02:23.040> pump<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:24.139> supply<00:02:25.139> water<00:02:25.440> usage<00:02:26.099> as

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the pump will supply water usage as

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.289 
the pump will supply water usage as
needed<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.720> saw<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:27.989> then<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
needed as you just saw right then and

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.699 
needed as you just saw right then and
when<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:31.190> usage<00:02:32.190> demand<00:02:32.639> is<00:02:32.940> stopped<00:02:33.709> faucet

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
when the usage demand is stopped faucet

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.020 
when the usage demand is stopped faucet
turned<00:02:35.130> off<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.489> other<00:02:35.579> words

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
turned off in other words

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.080 
turned off in other words
then<00:02:36.780> it'll<00:02:37.230> continue<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.739> pump<00:02:38.160> until<00:02:38.700> this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
then it'll continue to pump until this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.629 
then it'll continue to pump until this
pressure<00:02:39.359> tank<00:02:39.720> reaches<00:02:40.079> 40<00:02:40.410> psi<00:02:40.859> at<00:02:41.459> that

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
pressure tank reaches 40 psi at that

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.409 
pressure tank reaches 40 psi at that
point<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:41.970> shuts<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.299> now<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.319> gauge<00:02:43.590> is

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.419 
point it shuts off now that the gauge is

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.960 
point it shuts off now that the gauge is
way<00:02:45.419> up<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.530> above<00:02:47.250> 40<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.639> think<00:02:47.669> it's

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
way up there it's above 40 I think it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
way up there it's above 40 I think it's
reading<00:02:48.209> about<00:02:48.389> 70<00:02:48.810> psi<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.410> now<00:02:49.620> that's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
reading about 70 psi right now that's

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.720 
reading about 70 psi right now that's
because<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:51.470> we're<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> Texas<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.310> we've<00:02:53.489> had

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
because of we're in Texas and we've had

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
because of we're in Texas and we've had
some<00:02:53.970> from<00:02:54.510> freezing<00:02:54.930> weather<00:02:55.169> and<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.859> of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
some from freezing weather and one of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.300 
some from freezing weather and one of
the<00:02:56.040> freezes<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.549> had<00:02:57.799> messed<00:02:58.799> up<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> gauge

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the freezes we had messed up the gauge

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
the freezes we had messed up the gauge
but<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.480> system<00:03:00.870> itself<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.290> still<00:03:01.470> working

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
but the system itself is still working

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.379 
but the system itself is still working
fine<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.609> gauge<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:02.970> reading

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
fine just the gauge is not reading

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.390 
fine just the gauge is not reading

other videos as well I'm showing the
solar<00:04:31.460> water<00:04:31.699> heater<00:04:31.940> which<00:04:32.449> if<00:04:33.349> you<00:04:33.470> haven't

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
solar water heater which if you haven't

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.129 
solar water heater which if you haven't
done<00:04:33.830> one<00:04:34.009> of<00:04:34.039> those<00:04:34.220> those<00:04:35.120> are<00:04:35.270> cool<00:04:35.479> one<00:04:36.050> of

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
done one of those those are cool one of

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.189 
done one of those those are cool one of
those<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:37.610> discharges<00:04:38.479> coming<00:04:38.690> off<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> top

here<00:04:39.669> goes<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:41.090> our<00:04:41.479> water<00:04:41.810> filtration<00:04:42.169> system

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
here goes to our water filtration system

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.790 
here goes to our water filtration system
and<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.050> another<00:04:45.949> frugal<00:04:46.430> way<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:47.410> do<00:04:50.800> you

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
and this is another frugal way to do you

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.240 
and this is another frugal way to do you
know<00:04:51.919> rainwater<00:04:52.340> collection<00:04:54.250> without

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
spending a lot of money for instance if

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980 
spending a lot of money for instance if
you<00:04:57.789> hire<00:04:58.789> a<00:04:58.820> consultant<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.479> come<00:04:59.659> out<00:04:59.810> they

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
you hire a consultant to come out they

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.589 
you hire a consultant to come out they
might<00:05:00.310> cost<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.849> know<00:05:01.970> six<00:05:02.389> or<00:05:02.479> eight

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
might cost you know six or eight

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.110 
might cost you know six or eight
thousand<00:05:03.050> dollars<00:05:03.349> or<00:05:03.500> more

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
thousand dollars or more

thousand dollars or more
we<00:05:05.659> don't<00:05:05.840> really<00:05:06.050> see<00:05:06.289> any<00:05:06.620> sense<00:05:07.039> in

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
we don't really see any sense in

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.230 
we don't really see any sense in
treating<00:05:09.139> your<00:05:09.380> water<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:10.370> Cryptosporidium

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.360 
and things like that with the UV light
with<00:05:13.580> an<00:05:13.669> expensive<00:05:13.940> UV<00:05:14.780> filter<00:05:15.169> if<00:05:16.159> they're

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
with an expensive UV filter if they're

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.490 
with an expensive UV filter if they're
just<00:05:16.490> bathing<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.210> or<00:05:17.960> washing<00:05:18.289> your

that<00:05:20.150> big<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.330> deal<00:05:20.570> so<00:05:21.280> this<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.520> actually<00:05:22.880> a

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
that big a deal so this is actually a
