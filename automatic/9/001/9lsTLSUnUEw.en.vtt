00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620 
got Dodger with me in 11 month old black
Labrador<00:00:22.859> male<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.640> we're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Labrador male and we're going to be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
Labrador male and we're going to be
addressing<00:00:24.960> some<00:00:25.289> healing<00:00:25.769> sequences<00:00:26.670> here

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
addressing some healing sequences here

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.640 
addressing some healing sequences here
in<00:00:27.150> which<00:00:27.420> Dodger<00:00:27.779> has<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> tendency<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
in which Dodger has a tendency of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.230 
in which Dodger has a tendency of
putting<00:00:29.010> his<00:00:29.099> nose<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> ground<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
putting his nose on the ground all the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
putting his nose on the ground all the
time<00:00:30.449> while<00:00:30.660> I'm<00:00:30.810> healing<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.160> going

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
time while I'm healing so what I'm going

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
time while I'm healing so what I'm going
to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.940> incorporate<00:00:33.630> both<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> leash<00:00:34.440> in

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to do is incorporate both the leash in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350 
to do is incorporate both the leash in
the<00:00:34.680> chain<00:00:34.920> collar<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.520> you've<00:00:35.700> seen<00:00:35.880> before

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the chain collar as you've seen before

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
the chain collar as you've seen before
but<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:36.930> also<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> introduce<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
but I'm also going to introduce the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
but I'm also going to introduce the
electrical<00:00:38.850> stimulation<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
electrical stimulation with that so in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
electrical stimulation with that so in
the<00:00:41.250> process<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.850> doing<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.270> there's<00:00:42.809> going

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the process of doing this there's going

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.049 
the process of doing this there's going
to<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.079> an<00:00:43.230> icon<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:44.789> hand

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to be an icon in the in the right hand

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
to be an icon in the in the right hand
side<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.600> screen<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
side of your screen and it's going to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
side of your screen and it's going to
show<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.160> each<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> apply

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
show you each time that I apply

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
show you each time that I apply
electrical<00:00:49.440> stimulation<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
electrical stimulation so with that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.639 
electrical stimulation so with that
let's<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.930> started<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:53.149> that's<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.449> boy<00:00:54.660> good

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
let's get started you that's my boy good

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.260 
let's get started you that's my boy good
now<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.129> important<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.789> he's<00:00:57.000> working

that's my boy he you there you go he oh
that<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.189> stimulation<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> applied

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that was stimulation I just applied

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.340 
that was stimulation I just applied
there<00:01:06.810> he<00:01:07.500> oh<00:01:07.790> he<00:01:08.790> oke<00:01:09.240> Oke<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> applied

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
there he oh he oke Oke now I applied

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.370 
there he oh he oke Oke now I applied
stimulation<00:01:11.010> ant<00:01:11.220> heel<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.810> leash<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
stimulation ant heel and my leash at the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
stimulation ant heel and my leash at the
same<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> his

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
same time because this again is his

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
same time because this again is his
first<00:01:15.869> introduction<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.950> electrical

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
first introduction to electrical

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.039 
first introduction to electrical
stimulation<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.340> try<00:01:20.520> again

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
stimulation here so let's try again

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
stimulation here so let's try again
by<00:01:22.049> getting<00:01:22.320> him<00:01:22.439> over<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.830> into<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> deeper

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
by getting him over here into the deeper

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
by getting him over here into the deeper
cover<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.600> apt<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> he's<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
cover it's more apt that he's going to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.600 
cover it's more apt that he's going to
be<00:01:25.409> smelling<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.920> heel<00:01:26.220> heel<00:01:27.080> very<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.610> now

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
be smelling at heel heel very good now

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
be smelling at heel heel very good now
each<00:01:29.820> time<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.390> apply<00:01:31.100> momentary

each time that I do apply momentary

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.840 
each time that I do apply momentary
electrical<00:01:32.759> stimulation<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:34.049> sit<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.100> give

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
electrical stimulation here sit I give

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
electrical stimulation here sit I give
my<00:01:36.030> verbal<00:01:36.299> command<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.079> exactly<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> same

my verbal command at exactly the same
moment<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.579> command<00:01:38.970> being<00:01:39.150> heel<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
moment that command being heel because I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
moment that command being heel because I
want<00:01:40.619> him<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> understand<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.790> word<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
