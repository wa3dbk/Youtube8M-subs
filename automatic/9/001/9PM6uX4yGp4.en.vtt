00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
cuz she different doesn't mean she

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.809 
cuz she different doesn't mean she
doesn't<00:00:37.289> like<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.159> know<00:00:38.280> fit<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:38.999> like<00:00:39.780> uh

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
sometimes people will just stare her

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.649 
sometimes people will just stare her
it's<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.280> normal<00:00:44.280> person<00:00:44.609> here<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.329> moving

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so my whole life would probably be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.119 
so my whole life would probably be
different<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:50.100> she<00:00:50.639> didn't<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.089> disease
