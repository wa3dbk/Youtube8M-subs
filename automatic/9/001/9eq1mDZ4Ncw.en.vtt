00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 youtube this time I have the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.150
 installation of oil lights for the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.660
 chevrolet style 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.430
 as you can notice in the video is 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.940
 It is necessary to lower all the bumper 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.480
 vehicle since the units have a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.460
 fourth screw hidden behind the bomber 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.550
 and to lower them always additionally 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.890
 taking advantage of disarmament, we do the 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.559
 installation of the bullets of light is 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.170
 so in a professional way where 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.920
 they are well anchored with their respective 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.379
 screws to the car chassis there we go 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.350
 to make sure that the ballasts do not go 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.070
 to suffer from vibrations sharp blows 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 by the movement of the car engine and 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.350
 much less for water 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 this is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 pretty much the installation process and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 I will show you later when the subject 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 we already have the vehicle totally 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.189
 We joined because we put the bumper to him 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 we installed the hbe we put the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.080
 cocuyos on white led and taking advantage 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.180
 that the blow we had it down 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.900
 and I did an installation of some 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.130
 red lights that light up behind 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.520
 of the pressure to the vehicle we are going to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520
 turn on the lights 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.250
 and we look at how the cocuyos are 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.350
 and the red lights on the blind 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.490
 later we will look at how the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.610
 hd 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.590
 at this moment he only has 2 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 the fireflies lit 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.939
 and the blind that shines completely 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.939
 red 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.320
 super good 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.860
 let's check the operation of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.860
 the oil 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.860
 to be able to light them we have to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 have the switch 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 Closed 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.100
 and here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.380
 there you can see 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.380
 when I turn them on and when he turned them off 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:37.100
 in high high and low casualties 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.100
 let's go to the front 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.110
 remember that there are facilities for 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.110
 chevrolet 6 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.510
 it can clearly 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.409
 lights 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.409
 This to me
