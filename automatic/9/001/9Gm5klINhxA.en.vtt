months after passing their tests our

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.809 
months after passing their tests our
research<00:02:37.290> shows<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.099> have<00:02:38.250> reduced<00:02:38.700> that

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
research shows that we have reduced that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.420 
research shows that we have reduced that
by<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.420> than<00:02:39.630> half<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.980> definite
