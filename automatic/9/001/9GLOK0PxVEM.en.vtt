the Machine off on purpose because I
didn't<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.610> thread<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.720> had<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
didn't have thread in it and I had the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
didn't have thread in it and I had the
upper<00:02:07.259> thread<00:02:07.530> sensor<00:02:07.950> turned<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.850> by

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
upper thread sensor turned off just by

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
upper thread sensor turned off just by
touching<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.290> icon<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> X

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
touching this icon there with the X

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.690 
touching this icon there with the X
there<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.930> means<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.380> turned<00:02:13.709> off<00:02:13.980> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
there that means it's turned off so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.790 
there that means it's turned off so
right<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.150> lower<00:02:15.540> thread<00:02:15.930> control<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
right now the lower thread control and

you<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.500> thread<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.090> turn<00:02:24.300> off

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
you have thread you can just turn off

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080 
you have thread you can just turn off
the<00:02:24.840> lower<00:02:25.050> thread<00:02:25.709> control<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.910> don't

the lower thread control if you don't

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.120 
the lower thread control if you don't
want<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.420> bothered<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.769> then<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
want to be bothered with it and then you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.710 
want to be bothered with it and then you

won't get that message on the screen
I<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.350> suggest<00:02:31.560> leaving<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> upper<00:02:32.570> thread

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
to see because of the lighting but

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.350 
to see because of the lighting but
there's<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.330> little<00:02:57.570> wire<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.400> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
there's a little wire here that the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.160 
there's a little wire here that the
thread<00:03:00.690> runs<00:03:01.049> through<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.630> thread<00:03:04.019> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
thread runs through when you thread the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.640 
thread runs through when you thread the
machine<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.340> little<00:03:05.760> wire<00:03:06.030> adds<00:03:06.480> tension<00:03:07.320> to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
machine this little wire adds tension to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
machine this little wire adds tension to
the<00:03:07.830> thread<00:03:08.100> when<00:03:08.340> you're<00:03:08.519> sewing<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.630> that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the thread when you're sewing and that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.770 
the thread when you're sewing and that
wire<00:03:10.080> goes<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.769> down<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.480> will

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
wire goes up and down that is what will

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500 
wire goes up and down that is what will
set<00:03:13.019> off<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.709> message<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.820> your<00:03:15.090> upper

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
set off the message that your upper

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.229 
set off the message that your upper
thread<00:03:15.810> has<00:03:16.049> broken<00:03:16.430> okay<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.030> good

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
thread has broken okay and the good

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210 
thread has broken okay and the good
reason<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.169> this<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.889> on

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
reason I think to have this on is on

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.360 
reason I think to have this on is on
older<00:03:20.609> machines<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:22.169> wire<00:03:22.410> can

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
older machines this little wire can

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.710 
older machines this little wire can
we're<00:03:23.489> through<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> top<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.569> actually

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
we're through at the top and actually

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.380 
we're through at the top and actually
break<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.709> when<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.640> wire<00:03:26.849> breaks

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
break and when that little wire breaks

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.300 
break and when that little wire breaks
that's<00:03:27.989> after<00:03:28.260> you've<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.650> hundreds<00:03:29.159> and

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
that's after you've have hundreds and

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.399 
that's after you've have hundreds and
hundreds<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.700> hours<00:03:29.819> on<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> machine<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:31.290> it

hundreds of hours on a machine but it

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.920 
hundreds of hours on a machine but it
also<00:03:31.590> depends<00:03:32.159> on<00:03:32.220> how<00:03:32.370> abrasive<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.659> thread

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
also depends on how abrasive the thread

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.020 
also depends on how abrasive the thread

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.280 
that check up or thread and that's
usually<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.500> good<00:04:01.590> source<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.310> problem<00:04:02.790> is

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
usually a good source of the problem is

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.420 
usually a good source of the problem is
possibility<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.739> this<00:04:04.890> little<00:04:05.220> spring

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
possibility that just this little spring

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.220 
possibility that just this little spring
breaks<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.540> messes<00:04:06.750> up<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.200> whole

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
breaks it really messes up the whole

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.220 
breaks it really messes up the whole
machine<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.790> because<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.720> would

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
machine so just because of that I would

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.949 
machine so just because of that I would
leave<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:11.010> upper<00:04:11.280> thread<00:04:11.549> tension<00:04:11.959> message

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
leave the upper thread tension message

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.710 
leave the upper thread tension message
turned<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.829> but<00:04:14.489> if<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.819> lower<00:04:15.000> one<00:04:15.299> gets<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
turned on but if the lower one gets to

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.689 
turned on but if the lower one gets to
become<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.079> pain<00:04:16.410> because<00:04:16.919> maybe<00:04:17.370> there's

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
become a pain because maybe there's

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.500 
become a pain because maybe there's
something<00:04:17.940> wrong<00:04:18.269> with<00:04:18.690> your<00:04:18.930> sensor<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:20.510> but

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
something wrong with your sensor I but

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.330 
something wrong with your sensor I but
you<00:04:21.720> can<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.049> turn<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.440> off<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.860> want<00:04:23.130> to
