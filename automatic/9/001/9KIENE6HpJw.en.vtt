one<00:03:41.310> that's<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.639> packaging<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.450> RT<00:03:43.019> 33<00:03:43.769> B

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
and I think it comes in different links

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.360 
and I think it comes in different links
-<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.669> 14<00:03:48.120> 14<00:03:48.900> inch<00:03:49.349> length<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:52.370> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
one is the RT 33 now this looked more

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.300
