is a great thing to actually have i did
not<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.570> on<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.020> game<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.500> that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
not have it on in this game and that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.890 
not have it on in this game and that
would<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.460> helped<00:02:42.880> quite<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> bit<00:02:43.690> and

would have really helped quite a bit and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.750 
would have really helped quite a bit and
it<00:02:44.200> ghost<00:02:44.770> isn't<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.220> bad<00:02:45.400> thing<00:02:45.430> either

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760

it ghost isn't a bad thing either
especially<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:46.510> you're<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.780> go<00:02:46.870> for

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
especially if you're going to go for

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.990 
especially if you're going to go for
those<00:02:47.140> high<00:02:47.320> killstreaks<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.370> realistically

those high killstreaks but realistically

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.730 
those high killstreaks but realistically
there's<00:02:49.330> no<00:02:49.450> point<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> lodestar

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
little time basically as soon as you

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.520 
little time basically as soon as you
call<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.540> your<00:03:04.660> swarm<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.110> game's<00:03:05.290> over

call on your swarm the game's over

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.980 
call on your swarm the game's over
because<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.670> know<00:03:06.820> basically<00:03:07.300> couldn't

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
because a you know basically couldn't

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.500 
because a you know basically couldn't
have<00:03:08.080> died<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.400> your<00:03:09.670> mo<00:03:09.820> at<00:03:10.000> which<00:03:10.270> I

have died and that is your mo at which I

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.510 
have died and that is your mo at which I
will<00:03:10.930> probably<00:03:11.320> go<00:03:11.470> back<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.130> swarm

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
will probably go back on the swarm

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.120 
will probably go back on the swarm
videos<00:03:13.510> come<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> little<00:03:14.260> bit<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.740> also

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130
