tuner pedals we found on the market was

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.069 
tuner pedals we found on the market was

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
that a lot of them had red LED lights

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
that a lot of them had red LED lights
take<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.170> outside<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.059> sunlight

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
take it outside and if it's in sunlight

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.340 
take it outside and if it's in sunlight
you<00:00:42.540> can't<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.079> all

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you can't see it at all

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
you can't see it at all
so<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.399> did<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.820> went<00:00:45.030> ahead<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> we

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so what we did is we went ahead and we

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.190 
so what we did is we went ahead and we
made<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> big<00:00:46.500> change<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> got<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> blue<00:00:47.940> LED

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
made a big change it's got a blue LED

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
made a big change it's got a blue LED
first<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> show<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.730> guitar

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
first I want to show you that the guitar

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.110 
first I want to show you that the guitar
tone<00:00:51.300> comes<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> bypass<00:00:53.789> mode

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
tone comes through in the bypass mode

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
tone comes through in the bypass mode
and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.660> once<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.110> turn<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.340> mutes<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and then once you turn it on it mutes it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
and then once you turn it on it mutes it
so<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.719> audience<00:00:57.930> doesn't<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so your audience doesn't have to go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
so your audience doesn't have to go
through<00:00:58.920> hearing<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.699> tune<00:00:59.940> which<00:01:00.359> means<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
through hearing you tune which means you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
through hearing you tune which means you
can<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:00.989> use<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.590> an<00:01:01.800> auxiliary<00:01:02.309> kill

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
can also use it as an auxiliary kill

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
can also use it as an auxiliary kill
switch<00:01:03.030> absolutely<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> we'll<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.710> show

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

two steps and two and a half steps

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900 
two steps and two and a half steps
that's<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> heck<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.100> ways<00:02:17.280> down<00:02:17.310> that's

what<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> pitch<00:02:24.840> button<00:02:25.140> does<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.830> allows

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
what the pitch button does is it allows

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.440 
what the pitch button does is it allows
you<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.640> alter<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.390> tuning<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.560> tuner

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that are not easily tuned like a piano

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.050 
that are not easily tuned like a piano
I'm<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.270> piano<00:02:36.720> cannot<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.230> tuned<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.739> fly

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
I'm a piano cannot be tuned on the fly

and the cool thing about it is that even

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.710 
and the cool thing about it is that even
though<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> piano<00:02:41.700> may<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.030> little<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
though the piano may be a little out of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.530 
though the piano may be a little out of
tune<00:02:42.959> if<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.680> hold<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> pitch<00:02:44.190> button<00:02:44.550> it'll
