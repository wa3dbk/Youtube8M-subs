hell yes
yes<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.200> amazing<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:22.570> course<00:03:22.930> there<00:03:23.140> are

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
yes it's amazing but of course there are

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.100

consequences

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
consequences

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.300 
consequences
I<00:03:26.780> for<00:03:27.780> example<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.320> removed<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:29.040> smoke

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
I for example I removed the smoke

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.420 
I for example I removed the smoke
detector<00:03:29.880> distribution<00:03:30.570> meaning<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
detector distribution meaning that the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 
detector distribution meaning that the
risk<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.730> fire<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.330> increased<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
risk of fire just increased the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.610 
risk of fire just increased the
recycling<00:03:35.310> capabilities<00:03:38.330> decreased<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
recycling capabilities decreased and the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.540 
recycling capabilities decreased and the
education<00:03:41.160> boost<00:03:41.430> again<00:03:42.650> decreased<00:03:44.870> so

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
education boost again decreased so

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.180 
education boost again decreased so
education<00:03:47.550> helps<00:03:47.910> us<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.210> get<00:03:48.420> huge<00:03:49.190> cities
