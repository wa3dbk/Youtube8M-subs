it's<00:03:43.670> all<00:03:43.790> written<00:03:44.000> here<00:03:44.330> steps<00:03:45.190> steps<00:03:46.190> step

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
it's all written here steps steps step

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.290 
it's all written here steps steps step
so<00:03:48.800> it's<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:51.170> looks<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.650> must<00:03:51.830> open

me open a few of these and spread them

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.440 
me open a few of these and spread them
out<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.960> little<00:04:30.200> bit<00:04:30.440> we<00:04:31.340> did<00:04:31.520> better<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:32.090> better

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
out a little bit we did better a better

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.100 
out a little bit we did better a better
insight<00:04:33.640> missus<00:04:34.640> just<00:04:34.940> god<00:04:35.420> knows<00:04:35.660> what<00:04:35.870> so

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
insight missus just god knows what so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.750 
insight missus just god knows what so
now<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.500> looks<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.800> spur<00:04:37.130> gear<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.580> there

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
now it looks like a spur gear in there

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.180 
now it looks like a spur gear in there
if<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:38.930> huge

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
if so it's huge

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.670 
if so it's huge
a<00:04:41.020> cooking<00:04:42.020> part<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.590> mechanical<00:04:43.280> braking

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
a cooking part of the mechanical braking

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.780 
a cooking part of the mechanical braking
looks<00:04:45.680> like<00:04:45.980> it<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.460> that's<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.570> oil<00:04:48.790> gearbox

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
looks like it is that's the oil gearbox

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.900 
looks like it is that's the oil gearbox
oil<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.270> shock<00:04:50.540> oil<00:04:50.830> different<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.790> they

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
oil and shock oil different so they

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.830 
oil and shock oil different so they
couldn't

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
couldn't

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.240
