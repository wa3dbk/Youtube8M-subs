 sorry for the little pause that and good 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.629
 here we are again in good I am a 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.099
 once in minecraft with the official skin of 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.559
 minecraft obviously because still not 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.080
 I like to have another skin and good day 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.640
 today I 'm going to teach you how to make 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.600
 two minecraft tricks that are good 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 simple I think for some 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.150
 and good the trick that I want to teach them 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.580
 and ok 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.760
 it is of some arrows that is with these 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.760
 arrows for example being able to do 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.570
 Well, I'm going to put a small 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.080
 pause for you to see this how I'm going to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.510
 do me and well there I see them fast for 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.000
 that they see as path while puppeteer 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 band aid 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.410
 well I'm the tube that I wanted them 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.860
 teach that I did it super fast but 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.900
 this is the detail is here for example 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.809
 this is an arrow and they can put over 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.930
 carpets which is what I liked the most 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.930
 my 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.469
 of this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.520
 of this trick 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.470
 and well that's how the first one is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.800
 trick though I had to put a little 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.800
 of pause 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 because I'm telling 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.770
 I was very guided and this is the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.180
 first trick that is an arrow let's go to the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.180
 next excited for back 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.230
 well we are with the following trick that 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.030
 is to put a chest here or is it aimed at 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.310
 our two sides of a chest two 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.830
 sorry chests and here are two others that are going to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.430
 stay super parents 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.180
 that I liked too light 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.180
 and good 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.660
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.310
 put one because on the computer in the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.170
 more update look what I do if 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.270
 I put this here I put this equipment 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.250
 they are only made down and so what 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.260
 I will try to do as I get 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.570
 because I saw it and it's also for xbox 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.790
 everything that comes out here also is for 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.200
 xbox let's put this first we remove 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.600
 these from here then now with the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.600
 chest we put one 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.720
 we are one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.580
 a block so even 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 and now we put it 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.620
 we put the block here 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.620
 and good what we are going to do is this 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.580
 again let's put the block quoted 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.220
 here 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.500
 so that it can be clear I removed that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.290
 first so that it is very cool father 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.240
 although you can with two and good once 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.800
 replace the look with chest 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.470
 these things have to aim well here 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.040
 points well and look is super father or 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.950
 they can open this 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.459
 and they can open the bottom one so that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.150
 father or as it went well father is 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.409
 thing you can open the two just do not 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.730
 if you can here on the computer 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.519
 because he is what he tries and that is 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.000
 super cool or you can not imagine 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.579
 how it looked and good with this one that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.319
 I have left it until here I have them 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.879
 liked the video if you liked these 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.829
 other tricks I did but are for 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.170
 xbox i'm also the first one first is 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.129
 for both the first trick the one of the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.489
 arrow that you see here and there I do not know if the 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.989
 come is for is for the two types be 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.060
 computer and this but I also think that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.720
 is that computer power I do not know by 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.900
 what did not come out to me 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.460
 and this is the second trick is also 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.350
 navas is for xbox because what is 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.080
 saying orita that nothing else I think not 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.640
 it works for me and I do not know and well 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.320
