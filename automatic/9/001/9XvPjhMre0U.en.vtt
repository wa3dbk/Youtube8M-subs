00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the game i really do actually like Mona

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
the game i really do actually like Mona
43<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.720> call<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
43 I think it's a really good call of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.719 
43 I think it's a really good call of
duty<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> better<00:01:40.979> ones<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.640> do

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
duty one of the better ones but I do

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
duty one of the better ones but I do
think<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> lack<00:01:42.390> ops<00:01:42.570> has<00:01:42.750> been<00:01:42.930> best<00:01:43.110> quality

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
think the lack ops has been best quality

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.780 
think the lack ops has been best quality

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.250 
didn't really play him on 42 very much
and<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.100> actually<00:03:09.220> didn't<00:03:09.580> like<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.850> very<00:03:09.880> much

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
black ops was actually the very first

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.860 
black ops was actually the very first
call<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.640> duty<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.630> actually

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
call of duty that I really actually

call of duty that I really actually
started<00:03:14.410> playing<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.310> guess<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.269> religiously

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
started playing I guess a religiously

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.259 
started playing I guess a religiously
and<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.500> actually<00:03:18.040> really<00:03:18.489> enjoyed<00:03:18.760> black<00:03:19.030> ops

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
and I actually really enjoyed black ops

well<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.870> while<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.320> was<00:03:20.440> out<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:23.049> way

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
well it's a while it was out and the way

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.350 
well it's a while it was out and the way
did<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.890> map<00:03:24.070> packs<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.549> changed<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.239> know

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360

how<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.630> map<00:03:25.840> packs<00:03:26.110> came<00:03:26.350> out<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
how the map packs came out in all the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.039 
how the map packs came out in all the
call<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.010> duties<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.670> really<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.510> dislike

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
call of duties but I really just dislike

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.630 
call of duties but I really just dislike
the<00:03:29.410> way<00:03:29.530> they're<00:03:29.680> doing<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.980> model<00:03:30.280> for<00:03:30.430> 3

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
the way they're doing it model for 3

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.729 
the way they're doing it model for 3
let's<00:03:30.790> call<00:03:31.030> duty<00:03:31.299> elite<00:03:31.630> system<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.230> think

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739

it's complete garbage and I kind of wish
you<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.840> go<00:03:35.019> back<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.410> old<00:03:35.739> way<00:03:35.890> just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
you to go back to the old way just

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.200 
you to go back to the old way just
is<00:03:36.660> uh<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.310> rolling<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
is uh you know I like rolling and

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.050 
is uh you know I like rolling and
getting<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.540> PSN<00:03:40.080> or<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:40.680> microsoft<00:03:41.640> points

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
getting my PSN or my microsoft points

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.580 
getting my PSN or my microsoft points
and<00:03:42.210> buying<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.660> maps<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.050> way<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.410> much

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and buying the maps that way I'm much

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.220 
and buying the maps that way I'm much
more<00:03:43.770> comfortable<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.150> really<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
more comfortable like that and really I

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.840 
more comfortable like that and really I
think<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.560> leads<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.860> bit<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.190> rip<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.550> for

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
think the leads a bit of a rip off for

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.340 
think the leads a bit of a rip off for
myself<00:03:48.450> some<00:03:48.660> people<00:03:48.900> might<00:03:48.990> think<00:03:49.050> it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
myself some people might think it's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.680 
myself some people might think it's
valid<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.370> purchase<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.300> don't<00:03:51.570> really

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
valid you know purchase I don't really

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.970 
valid you know purchase I don't really
think<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.080> was<00:03:52.140> worth<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.380> money<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.950> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
think it was worth the money that I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.150 
think it was worth the money that I
spent<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:54.480> don't<00:03:55.410> think<00:03:55.470> elites<00:03:55.890> really

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
spent for it I don't think elites really

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.830 
spent for it I don't think elites really
the<00:03:56.250> greatest<00:03:56.490> thing<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.970> nothing<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.690> mall

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
bad I think all of them are very good

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.950 
bad I think all of them are very good
but<00:04:12.320> personally<00:04:13.520> like<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.640> was<00:04:14.760> saying<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
but personally like I was saying the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.650 
but personally like I was saying the
black<00:04:16.200> ops<00:04:16.470> dlc<00:04:17.130> was<00:04:17.520> pretty<00:04:18.150> decent<00:04:18.300> there's

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
black ops dlc was pretty decent there's

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.690 
black ops dlc was pretty decent there's
some<00:04:18.870> not-so-great<00:04:19.620> maps<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.280> my<00:04:20.430> opinion

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
some not-so-great maps in my opinion

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.650 
some not-so-great maps in my opinion
some<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.090> them<00:04:21.210> weren't<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.480> greatest

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
some of them weren't the greatest

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.200 
some of them weren't the greatest
discovery<00:04:22.620> wasn't<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:22.980> greatest<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.820> uh<00:04:23.850> I

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
discovery wasn't the greatest but uh I

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.470 
discovery wasn't the greatest but uh I
just<00:04:25.020> like<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.320> way<00:04:25.350> over<00:04:25.830> all<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.490> uh<00:04:26.520> black

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
just like the way over all that uh black

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.180 
just like the way over all that uh black
ops<00:04:27.720> made<00:04:28.020> their<00:04:28.170> map<00:04:28.290> packs<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.740> well<00:04:28.950> as

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
ops made their map packs as well as

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.340 
ops made their map packs as well as
model<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.000> mod<00:04:30.300> for<00:04:30.480> two<00:04:30.600> had<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.320> good

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
model for to mod for two had the good

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.800 
model for to mod for two had the good
deal<00:04:31.680> see<00:04:32.010> as<00:04:32.130> well<00:04:32.400> for<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.330> fact<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.660> you

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
deal see as well for the fact that you

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.660 
deal see as well for the fact that you
could<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.110> go<00:04:34.230> out<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.380> buy<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> points<00:04:35.130> and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
could just go out and buy the points and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.040 
could just go out and buy the points and
one<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.030> reasons<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:37.020> that

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
one of the reasons I like that is that

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.800 
one of the reasons I like that is that
the<00:04:37.320> fact<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.730> both<00:04:38.730> black<00:04:39.090> ops<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.540> model

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
the fact that both black ops and model

that<00:05:05.310> way<00:05:05.810> but<00:05:06.810> uh<00:05:06.870> I'd<00:05:07.860> rather<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.340> go<00:05:08.550> into

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
that way but uh I'd rather just go into

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.040 
that way but uh I'd rather just go into
normal<00:05:09.030> matchmaking<00:05:09.480> something<00:05:09.930> like

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
normal matchmaking something like

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.480 
normal matchmaking something like
domination<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:10.860> don't<00:05:10.980> have<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.100> deal<00:05:11.370> with

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
domination so I don't have to deal with

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.100 
domination so I don't have to deal with
hope<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.910> friend<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.360> Team<00:05:12.510> Deathmatch<00:05:12.690> and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
hope and friend and Team Deathmatch and

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.510 
hope and friend and Team Deathmatch and
I'd<00:05:13.230> really<00:05:13.410> just<00:05:13.530> play<00:05:13.860> just<00:05:14.250> straight-up

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
I'd really just play just straight-up

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.150 
I'd really just play just straight-up
domination<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.510> be<00:05:16.410> able<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.650> play<00:05:16.860> on<00:05:16.890> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
domination and be able to play on the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.760 
domination and be able to play on the
DLC<00:05:18.030> maps<00:05:18.240> from<00:05:18.360> are<00:05:18.540> 43<00:05:18.930> but<00:05:19.110> apparently

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
DLC maps from are 43 but apparently

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.080 
DLC maps from are 43 but apparently
that's<00:05:19.830> not<00:05:19.920> an<00:05:20.100> option<00:05:20.250> considering<00:05:20.850> they're

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
that's not an option considering they're

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.970 
that's not an option considering they're
not<00:05:21.210> being<00:05:21.420> put<00:05:21.690> into<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.990> map<00:05:22.170> rotation<00:05:22.800> or

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
not being put into the map rotation or

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.620 
not being put into the map rotation or
at<00:05:23.070> least<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.370> have<00:05:23.670> not<00:05:23.820> ran<00:05:24.090> into<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.450> myself

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
at least I have not ran into it myself

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.780 
at least I have not ran into it myself
and<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.380> know<00:05:25.470> wings<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:26.100> redemption<00:05:26.220> hasn't

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
and I know wings of redemption hasn't

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.180 
and I know wings of redemption hasn't
either<00:05:26.880> so<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.690> kind<00:05:28.410> of<00:05:28.440> wish<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.620> they<00:05:28.890> do<00:05:29.070> it

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
either so I kind of wish that they do it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.300 
either so I kind of wish that they do it
just<00:05:29.340> like<00:05:29.430> black<00:05:29.730> ops<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.090> model<00:05:30.330> 42<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:32.160> the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
just like black ops and model 42 and the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.710 
just like black ops and model 42 and the
one<00:05:32.460> thing<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.880> also<00:05:32.970> liked<00:05:33.300> about<00:05:33.450> those

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
one thing that I also liked about those

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.080 
one thing that I also liked about those

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
two games as well with the map packs is

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.730 
two games as well with the map packs is
that<00:05:36.210> they<00:05:36.330> released<00:05:36.630> five<00:05:36.870> out<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.140> time<00:05:37.440> not

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
that they released five out of time not

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.740 
that they released five out of time not
like<00:05:37.920> one<00:05:38.190> every<00:05:38.460> month<00:05:38.490> I'd<00:05:38.880> rather<00:05:39.330> just<00:05:39.570> get
