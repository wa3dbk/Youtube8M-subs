 the classic interface 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.639
 which brings back to power 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.869
 recently accused programs

 It's a job 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.469
 relatively small compared to the other devices of the manufacturer 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.439
 in front net 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.199

 proposed in the shower 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.319
 builder debt for example much nicer to use 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.259
 the main advantage of this seems so 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.030
 the doubled of the city which allows to have a complete keyboard azerty 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.009

 even if other models proposed clavicle more successful 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.360
 the most pleasant to the used 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.879
 but also several agreements 6% 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.879
 here for example internet browser 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.869
 switch to vibrate mode 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.889
 e not really that one 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.889
 communications manager

 it is necessary that the spirit of the bell so it will not be necessary 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.129
