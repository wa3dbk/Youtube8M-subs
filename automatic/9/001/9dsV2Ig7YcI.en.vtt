have to click the tab I mean that feels
like<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> me<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> step

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like to me a little bit of a step

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.999 
like to me a little bit of a step
backwards<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> should<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.380> least<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.740> able<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
backwards you should at least be able to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
backwards you should at least be able to
slide<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> forward<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> do

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
functions you can do with this so if we

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.640 
functions you can do with this so if we
put<00:02:25.490> up<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> timeline<00:02:26.120> by<00:02:26.840> follow<00:02:27.080> my<00:02:27.290> finger

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650

over the timeline you can see I get a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.590 
over the timeline you can see I get a
little<00:02:29.960> preview<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.950> where<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
little preview of where it is and you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.480 
little preview of where it is and you
can<00:02:32.630> kind<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.080> tap<00:02:33.380> there<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:33.920> obviously<00:02:34.220> skip

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
can kind of tap there now obviously skip

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.730

there<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.480> see<00:02:35.690> what<00:02:35.960> it's<00:02:36.110> what's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
there but you can see what it's what's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.200 
there but you can see what it's what's
what<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.160> about<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.520> show<00:02:37.700> before<00:02:37.910> you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
paused and this is another one of the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.470 
paused and this is another one of the
features<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.430> they've<00:02:49.760> added<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:50.210> called

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
features that they've added it's called

features that they've added it's called
smart<00:02:51.410> pause<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:52.040> think<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:52.970> called<00:02:53.120> smart

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390

smart pause I think it's called smart
pause<00:02:53.540> something<00:02:53.990> pause<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> away<00:02:54.590> probably

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
pause something pause and away probably

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.100

call<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.400> smart<00:02:55.520> pause<00:02:55.790> but<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.020> to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
call it smart pause but this is going to
