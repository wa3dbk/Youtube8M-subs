rainbows that come up in the stream and
you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.090> spawn<00:00:57.600> these<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.770> rainbows

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you know they spawn these these rainbows

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.040

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
come out come up and they spawn in the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
come out come up and they spawn in the
fall<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:03.000> different<00:01:03.420> than

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
fall which is a little different than

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
fall which is a little different than
most<00:01:04.080> rainbows<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> how

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
most rainbows but this is kind of how

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.380 
most rainbows but this is kind of how
they<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> stream<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> yeah<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.060> going

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
they do in the stream so yeah I'm going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
they do in the stream so yeah I'm going
to<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.750> video<00:01:09.900> haven't<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> 7<00:01:11.280> done

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.180 

I<00:01:48.080> think<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.140> fished<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.450> section<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.810> couple

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
I think I fished this section a couple

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.719 
I think I fished this section a couple
years<00:01:53.190> ago<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:55.440> recall<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.470> lake

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
years ago and I recall that the lake

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.350 
years ago and I recall that the lake
much<00:01:59.729> further<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:01.790> much<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:03.120> of<00:02:03.240> this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
much further down much more of this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.080 
much further down much more of this
river<00:02:04.020> open<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:09.360> not

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
river open but you can see it's not

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
river open but you can see it's not
water<00:02:12.090> level<00:02:12.420> isn't<00:02:12.570> isn't<00:02:12.990> as<00:02:13.320> far<00:02:13.560> down<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.830> I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
water level isn't isn't as far down as I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.500 
water level isn't isn't as far down as I
think<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.370> typically<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.970> typically<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
think it's typically it typically is so

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.220 
think it's typically it typically is so
but<00:02:19.010> some<00:02:20.010> type<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.220> stream<00:02:20.610> or<00:02:20.760> maybe<00:02:21.200> kind<00:02:22.200> of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
but some type of stream or maybe kind of

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.080 
but some type of stream or maybe kind of
piss<00:02:22.410> them<00:02:22.560> off<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.550> can't<00:02:23.790> snag<00:02:24.060> a
