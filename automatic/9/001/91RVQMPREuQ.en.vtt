00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 that are very nice and easy to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.200
 do you guys have been asking me 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.330
 videos about hairstyles for school and 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.160
 well and it's been a long time since I was born to one of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 these and these hairstyles that I'm going to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 teach are from the favorites that I have 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.530
 at this moment I hope you like them and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.989
 let's start 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.309
 for the first hairstyle we are going to divide 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.309
 our hair in 2 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.600
 and with the top part we're going to do 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.149
 a chongo 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.149
 and then tie it up I hide league 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 this hairstyle does not take you a minute and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.010
 it is one of my favorites apart from this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.220
 hairstyle has been very fashionable 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 lately 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.549
 ah 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.310
 and that's it 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.950
 this hairstyle looks a little complicated 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.100
 but since you grab the wave is super 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.860
 easy let's take a piece of our 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.980
 hair and we will divide it in two and 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.290
 then we'll roll it up later 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.840
 let's take another piece of the part of 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.930
 back and we're going to go through it in the middle of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.120
 the two we had before above 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.120
 of the above and below the second 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.350
 you have to stay like this so be in 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.890
 medium 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.170
 then we are going to roll up and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.330
 let's do the same thing again we take 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 a piece of the back and what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.369
 we went through the middle of the other two 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.560
 since you've reached the back 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.799
 of your head there has to be something left 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 well and then only the thorax with 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.260
 pins I add a bow for 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.349
 hide the pins and ready 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.349
 ah 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.110
 for the third hairstyle let's start 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.770
 making a French braid from the side 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.770
 what you want 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.659
 ah 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.469
 since you have reached the height of your 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.829
 ear and let's start braiding the 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.829
 normal 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.330
 with the other part of your hair we are going to 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.330
 make a changuito 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.709
 and then the braid that we just 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.910
 do the roll up and accommodate with 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.000
 some pins 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.000
 to 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.170
 If you have a little wheel left, nothing 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.120
 more accommodate it and I know that some 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.790
 small horses to see a 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.860
 little disheveled and then I added a 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.860
 small bow to make it look cuter 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.020
 Y 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.280
 i 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.310
 for the last hairstyle I took a part 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.060
 in front of my hair and I made a braid 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.060
 fish tail 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.080
 then tie it with a garter and the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.370
 accommodated with some pins in the part 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.639
 behind 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.290
 under this braid grab another piece 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.290
 of hair and I made another one 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 ah 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.260
 this hairstyle also serves with braids 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.130
 normal but I think it looks more 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.130
 cute with these 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.600
 and then I took a pin and I put it in 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.600
 and ready 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.789
 ah 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.820
