00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.329
 hello welcome I am lily and today we go 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.639
 to make some bands for the hair if 

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:11.549
 you want to see how we do them 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 seeing we begin what you are going to need 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.740
 are from the town you want and the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 type you choose I chose satin 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 but you can choose the ones that you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 you want fabric scissors a thread of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 color that you want but that combines 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 with the colors you chose tape 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 metric and a needle to sew what 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.970
 first thing you have to do is measure 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.150
 the size of your head with the ribbon 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.570
 Metric mine is 55 centimeters 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.080
 then you have to put that on the cloth 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 and you have to leave an extra hunk 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.820
 in this case I told him 10 centimeters to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.070
 be able to tie the knot because if you do not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 is going to stay now you have to measure the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 width of your band I want it five 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 centimeters then frame 10 for the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.220
 that when doubling that from the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.650
 size that I want 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.020
 since you have your rectangles marked 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.690
 in the fabrics what you have to do is 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.940
 cut it do not worry if you do not have it left 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.320
 right or you do not look perfect that does not 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.320
 it matters not going to see the end 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.210
 since you have your rectangles cut 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.090
 what you have to see is if you get the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.060
 have a right or a setback in my case 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.760
 mine has an opaque and not shiny side 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.010
 what you have to do is to know her 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.010
 the dull side or rear 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.740
 do not worry if you do not know how to sew it is very 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.660
 simple you just have to go 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.060
 putting the needle from one side to another and 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.130
 when you get to the end you just make a 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.130
 knot you do not need to be an expert in that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.190
 This is how our 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.650
 rectangles and once we met them 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.479
 remember it does not have to be perfect and the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.220
 yarn preferably be one color 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.650
 that matches with the colors that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 you chose but if you do not, do not worry 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.060
 flip those are not going to notice 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.119
 since you have known your rectangles 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.890
 what you have to do is give it 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.990
 laps and this means that you're going 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.140
 putting the cloth little by little until 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.450
 you get the opposite side or the side 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 right in my case that bright side cited 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.090
 when you have your rectangles 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.300
 flipped what you have to do is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.600
 interlacing the fabrics this is to spend a 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.360
 fabric below the other and create a 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.850
 kind of knot after the scale is a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.210
 little to that fit and ready and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.210
 do you have 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.670
 and to finish you take new corners 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.680
 of the bands and you go back to sew this 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.849
 is so that you do not get any of the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.849
 fabrics and you fall 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.930
 saying we put them 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.940
 and can use them with hair 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.740
 collected now can use the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.210
 comment loose and already the world this 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.210
 you can put it in thanks
