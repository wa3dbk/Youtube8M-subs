container here that I'm gonna be using I

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.459 
container here that I'm gonna be using I
just<00:00:58.090> picked<00:00:58.270> up<00:00:58.420> some<00:00:58.480> seed<00:00:59.079> starting

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
just picked up some seed starting

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.369 
just picked up some seed starting
potting<00:00:59.800> mix<00:00:59.980> which<00:01:00.280> I'm<00:01:00.489> going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:01.379> attempt

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
potting mix which I'm going to attempt

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.350 
potting mix which I'm going to attempt
to<00:01:02.500> use<00:01:02.710> see<00:01:03.280> how<00:01:03.399> well<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.760> works<00:01:03.969> this<00:01:04.180> is

to use see how well that works this is
my<00:01:04.540> first<00:01:04.869> attempt<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.740> growing<00:01:06.130> anything

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
my first attempt and growing anything

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.379 
my first attempt and growing anything
from<00:01:08.170> seed<00:01:08.439> so<00:01:08.649> this<00:01:09.069> is<00:01:09.159> gonna<00:01:09.310> be<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.520> nice

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:10.389 
from seed so this is gonna be a nice

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.410 
from seed so this is gonna be a nice
little<00:01:10.420> experiment<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:12.189> just<00:01:12.969> grabbing<00:01:13.329> a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
little experiment so just grabbing a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.999 
little experiment so just grabbing a
little<00:01:13.450> bit<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.990> soil<00:01:14.289> I'm<00:01:14.499> gonna<00:01:14.679> dump<00:01:14.920> it

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
little bit of the soil I'm gonna dump it

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.370 
little bit of the soil I'm gonna dump it
in<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:15.159> I<00:01:15.700> don't<00:01:16.569> believe<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.929> have<00:01:16.959> to<00:01:17.170> put

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
in here I don't believe I have to put

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.999 
in here I don't believe I have to put
the<00:01:17.499> seed<00:01:17.740> all<00:01:17.979> that<00:01:18.399> far<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:19.319> so<00:01:20.319> actually

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
the seed all that far in so actually

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.879 
the seed all that far in so actually
that<00:01:21.189> might<00:01:21.459> be<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:23.259> might<00:01:23.409> be<00:01:23.529> good<00:01:23.709> right

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
that might be that might be good right

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.830 
that might be that might be good right

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
that's easier and I'm definitely using

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.440 
that's easier and I'm definitely using
the<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.890> seed<00:02:18.069> starting<00:02:18.489> mix<00:02:18.670> only<00:02:19.150> because

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the the seed starting mix only because

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.890 
the the seed starting mix only because
it's<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:19.930> bit<00:02:20.050> softer<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.770> not<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.900> as

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
it's a little bit softer it's not as as

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.590 
it's a little bit softer it's not as as
tough<00:02:23.319> or<00:02:23.819> concentrated<00:02:24.819> as<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.209> regular

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
tough or concentrated as the regular

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
isn't gonna overwhelm the little seeds

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.199 
isn't gonna overwhelm the little seeds
or<00:02:39.130> not<00:02:39.940> allow<00:02:40.180> them<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:41.440> grow<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.209> I've

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
or not allow them to to grow so I've

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.460 
or not allow them to to grow so I've
never<00:02:43.390> done<00:02:43.569> this<00:02:43.630> before<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.080> I'm<00:02:44.140> not<00:02:44.170> quite

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
never done this before so I'm not quite

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.000 
never done this before so I'm not quite
sure<00:02:44.500> how<00:02:44.890> far<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.640> I'm<00:02:45.940> supposed<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.269> put<00:02:46.480> them

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
sure how far in I'm supposed to put them

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.979 
sure how far in I'm supposed to put them
so<00:02:48.010> let<00:02:48.190> me<00:02:48.280> move<00:02:48.400> these<00:02:48.670> over<00:02:48.700> here<00:02:48.989> move

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
so let me move these over here move

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.199 
so let me move these over here move
these<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> guys<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.640> see<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> little

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
these up so you guys can see a little

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.780 
these up so you guys can see a little
bit<00:02:55.390> better<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.590> I'm<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.190> sure<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> think

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
bit better and I'm not sure but I think

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.020 
bit better and I'm not sure but I think
I'm<00:02:58.330> just<00:02:58.540> supposed<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.989> put<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.470> on<00:02:59.650> top

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I'm just supposed to put it right on top

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.640 
I'm just supposed to put it right on top
I'm<00:03:01.030> gonna<00:03:01.150> put<00:03:01.390> two<00:03:01.569> in<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.109> space<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
I'm gonna put two in this one space and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.770 
I'm gonna put two in this one space and
now<00:03:02.739> that's<00:03:03.010> about<00:03:03.250> four<00:03:04.030> inches<00:03:04.239> apart<00:03:04.390> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
now that's about four inches apart and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.789 
now that's about four inches apart and
then<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:05.620> gonna<00:03:05.799> put<00:03:06.070> one<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.400> each<00:03:06.519> here

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
then I'm gonna put one in each here

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.210 
then I'm gonna put one in each here
and<00:03:09.450> basically<00:03:10.450> I'm<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.780> gonna<00:03:11.170> pinch<00:03:11.890> and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and basically I'm just gonna pinch and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.500 
and basically I'm just gonna pinch and
cover<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.010> under<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
cover it just so it's just under the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.800 
cover it just so it's just under the
soil<00:03:16.840> level<00:03:17.799> there<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.390> same<00:03:19.570> here

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
soil level there and do the same here

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.280 
soil level there and do the same here
pinch<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.670> pinch<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> wrong<00:03:22.959> way

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
pinch and pinch it the wrong way

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.160 
pinch and pinch it the wrong way
pinch<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.459> then<00:03:25.359> now<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:25.810> needs

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
pinch that and then now it just needs

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.470 
pinch that and then now it just needs
some<00:03:26.410> good<00:03:26.590> watering<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:28.090> little<00:03:28.299> bit<00:03:28.420> of

water on top and we'll just bag out of

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.160 
water on top and we'll just bag out of
the<00:03:31.180> way<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:33.100> let's<00:03:33.790> see<00:03:34.030> what<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.359> have<00:03:34.480> for

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
which is pretty good and won't spray it

rainbow bell this is a pretty neat one

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.280 
rainbow bell this is a pretty neat one
because<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.640> will<00:04:33.730> grow<00:04:34.030> many<00:04:34.870> different

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
because it will grow many different

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.720 
because it will grow many different
color<00:04:35.800> varieties<00:04:36.370> here<00:04:36.910> of<00:04:37.590> both<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.920> it's

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
color varieties here of both so it's

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.130 
color varieties here of both so it's
