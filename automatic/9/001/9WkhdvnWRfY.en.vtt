00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hi guys, all good, I'm going to do it today. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 with you a meal had I learned 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.490
 yesterday at dawn on the internet he 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.330
 I was watching a channel on youtube. 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 I sign and now thin and this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 person doing her week will we go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 hurt 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.109
 she was made wonderful yesterday she did 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.869
 a cafeteria to remember pot 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 therapy and I think that 's what she had 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 a microwave oven recipe and I 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.660
 giving a morning 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 I'm just crazy to eat 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 pamonha like pamonha kind of time in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.680
 when the end of the show and then when I saw the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.629
 So I told you, I do not have to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.879
 to do and it's very simple there are few 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.020
 ingredients and from there I saw that I 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.690
 bad for you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 So if it does not work out, you better 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 I think there 's no way not work 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.780
 because it was remade very well and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.370
 It's very easy to do 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 so just for you an ingredient that I 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 I need to give and like who wants to step 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 at the rate rate continue enjoying the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 video 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 Good, so the recipe ended for us. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 passes only ingredients 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.939
 On this ticket were two cans of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.290
 Corn I picked up a box whenever I 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 I find it a little easier when it comes to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 open and f in the water I'll get this water 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 as she still asked to encourage 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.140
 opinion I go straight 180 ml in the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 car on a meter but two churches are 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.490
 but she put the amount 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.990
 because you can get younger - sweet and she 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.320

 yeast and say that it will fight 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.600
 because yeast tell people that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.760
 yeast comes into action only 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.030
 one that comes into play when the oven 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.030

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.570
 to heat the oven in two minutes to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.780
 grade youth and anoint a shape with 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.070

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.000
 when i was younger 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.220
 Like, two years ago, I caught a lot of 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.340
 because when I was about to enter a 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.560
 way I always used 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.390
 face after spending a lifetime 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.160
 Entire is good, one to damn 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.950
 Back in the day I was watching television. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.140
 ballast band found the draw and out of nowhere 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.920

 It was the eviction in here. 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:18.230
 I love you, I love you, I 'll certainly drop it here 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.450
 So I have to leave it inside the oven. 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.450

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.419
 A little bit and then I 'll cut it out 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.729

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.409
 Okay, so this is the way I was and I'm going 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.419

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.639
