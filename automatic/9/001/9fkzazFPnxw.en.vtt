another

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
another
sar<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:32.489> i<00:02:32.519> practice<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.209> i'm<00:02:33.420> at<00:02:33.599> my<00:02:33.690> hotel

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
sar that i practice when i'm at my hotel

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.410 
sar that i practice when i'm at my hotel
room<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.769> that's<00:02:35.280> about<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.269> live

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
room but that's about it really for live

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.309 
room but that's about it really for live
when<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:36.930> come<00:02:37.110> over<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.920> gear<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
when we come over here to the gear and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.140 
when we come over here to the gear and
we<00:02:40.319> basically<00:02:40.560> start<00:02:41.069> off<00:02:41.220> obviously<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.849> firm

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
we basically start off obviously a firm

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.000 
we basically start off obviously a firm
and<00:02:42.299> power<00:02:42.450> conditioner<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:43.920> don't

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and power conditioner so that we don't

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.500 
and power conditioner so that we don't
get<00:02:44.190> too<00:02:44.370> much<00:02:44.549> interference<00:02:44.790> from<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.330> power

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
get too much interference from the power

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170 
get too much interference from the power
lines<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.769> get<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> switcher<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.610> case<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:48.030> have

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
lines we get the switcher in case I have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.089 
lines we get the switcher in case I have
to<00:02:48.299> switch<00:02:48.540> guitars<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.440> I'll<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.739> three

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
to switch guitars so I'll have three

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.309 
to switch guitars so I'll have three
different<00:02:50.390> possibilities<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.420> different

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
different possibilities for different

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.170 
different possibilities for different
guitars<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.010> could<00:02:53.159> have<00:02:53.310> patched<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.970> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
guitars that I could have patched in to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.750 
guitars that I could have patched in to
that<00:02:54.930> right<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.890> using<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.340> shure

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that right now I'm using a shure

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.910 
that right now I'm using a shure
wireless<00:02:57.329> --is<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:57.989> we're<00:02:58.200> demoing<00:02:58.409> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
wireless --is and then we're demoing the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.059 
wireless --is and then we're demoing the
x2<00:02:59.790> unit<00:03:00.209> from<00:03:00.870> line<00:03:01.110> 6<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.890> right

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
x2 unit from line 6 I think it is right

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.580 
x2 unit from line 6 I think it is right
yeah<00:03:02.670> down<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.269> we<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.109> heart<00:03:04.349> of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
yeah down here we get to the heart of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.550 
yeah down here we get to the heart of
the<00:03:04.980> tone<00:03:05.220> which<00:03:05.609> is<00:03:05.640> these<00:03:06.060> fractal<00:03:06.989> Ultra

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the tone which is these fractal Ultra

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
the tone which is these fractal Ultra
units<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.730> love<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.090> right<00:03:09.359> now

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
units which I'm in love with right now

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
units which I'm in love with right now
we<00:03:10.079> go<00:03:10.230> straight<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.950> unit<00:03:11.280> from<00:03:11.489> with

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
we go straight into this unit from with

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.720 
we go straight into this unit from with
the<00:03:11.819> guitars<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:13.140> straight<00:03:13.620> out<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.400> unit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the guitars go straight out of this unit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 
the guitars go straight out of this unit
into<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.269> marshall<00:03:15.989> power<00:03:16.200> amps<00:03:16.620> which<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
into the marshall power amps which is a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.199 
into the marshall power amps which is a
stereo<00:03:17.569> power<00:03:18.569> up<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.109> hundred<00:03:19.409> watts<00:03:20.209> and

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
stereo power up to hundred watts and

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.210 
stereo power up to hundred watts and
then<00:03:21.569> out<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:22.049> some<00:03:22.409> marshall<00:03:22.829> cabinets

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
then out to some marshall cabinets

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.630 
then out to some marshall cabinets
loaded<00:03:23.879> with<00:03:24.030> vintage<00:03:24.450> 30s<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.230> overall<00:03:26.099> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
loaded with vintage 30s so overall the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.539 
loaded with vintage 30s so overall the
setup<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.150> pretty<00:03:27.329> simple<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.440> when<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.370> get

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
setup is pretty simple but when you get

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.369 
setup is pretty simple but when you get
into<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.849> complexity<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.629> units<00:03:31.109> and

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
into the complexity of this units and

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.170 
into the complexity of this units and
that's<00:03:31.590> where<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:32.819> all<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
that's where you get you know all of the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.430 
that's where you get you know all of the
different<00:03:33.510> pedals<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.170> different

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
different pedals and the different

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.900 
different pedals and the different
effects<00:03:34.859> combinations<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:35.790> can

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
effects combinations that you can

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.970 
effects combinations that you can
possibly<00:03:36.090> use<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.630> let<00:03:37.380> me<00:03:37.440> get<00:03:37.590> into<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.829> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
possibly use and let me get into that a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.110 
possibly use and let me get into that a
little<00:03:38.220> bit<00:03:38.370> more<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.880> you

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
little bit more for you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.370 
little bit more for you
i'll<00:03:39.239> show<00:03:39.389> you<00:03:39.450> what<00:03:39.660> i<00:03:39.690> use<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.260> some

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
i'll show you what i use it for and some

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.170 
i'll show you what i use it for and some
of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> cool<00:03:40.709> things<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.940> use

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
of the cool things that I like to use

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.759 
of the cool things that I like to use
them<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.540> I'll<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.410> bring<00:03:43.590> up<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
them for I'll just bring up the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.260 
them for I'll just bring up the
interface<00:03:44.280> for<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.609> axe<00:03:44.849> effects

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
interface for the axe effects

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.720 
interface for the axe effects
is<00:03:47.330> right<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.960> where<00:03:48.260> if<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.100> notice<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.520> take

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
is right here where if you notice I take

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.240 
is right here where if you notice I take
the<00:03:49.880> input<00:03:50.270> right<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.930> bring<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.680> off<00:03:51.830> to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
the input right here and bring it off to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.130 
the input right here and bring it off to
this<00:03:52.400> line<00:03:52.640> right<00:03:52.670> here<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.570> reason<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.960> like

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
this line right here the reason I like

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.460 
this line right here the reason I like
to<00:03:54.170> do<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.760> DI<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.080> when<00:03:57.290> we

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
to do that is for a DI so that when we

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.910 
to do that is for a DI so that when we
play<00:03:57.740> a<00:03:58.390> show<00:03:59.390> where<00:03:59.780> we<00:03:59.900> want<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.170> react<00:04:00.590> or

play a show where we want to react or

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.380 
play a show where we want to react or
something<00:04:01.280> like<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.670> later

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
something like that later

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.330 
something like that later
people<00:04:03.020> can<00:04:03.140> just<00:04:03.170> plug<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.770> to<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> left

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
people can just plug in to the left

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.990 
people can just plug in to the left
output<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:05.150> output<00:04:05.720> one<00:04:05.990> and<00:04:06.350> get<00:04:07.100> that<00:04:07.280> that

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
output of output one and get that that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.850 
output of output one and get that that
di<00:04:08.330> signal<00:04:09.050> so<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.470> don't<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.710> to

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
di signal so that you don't have to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.770 
di signal so that you don't have to
worry<00:04:10.040> about<00:04:10.130> putting<00:04:10.580> a<00:04:10.760> box<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.330> front<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.690> it

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
worry about putting a box in front of it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.070 
worry about putting a box in front of it
as<00:04:11.900> well<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:13.490> then<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:14.120> know<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.660> take<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
as well and then you know we take the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.750 
as well and then you know we take the
main<00:04:15.320> line<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.890> you're<00:04:16.070> gonna<00:04:16.190> run<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.670> your

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
main line that you're gonna run to your

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.210 
main line that you're gonna run to your
power<00:04:17.000> amp<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.600> have<00:04:18.500> your<00:04:18.650> amp<00:04:18.860> model

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
power amp and you have your amp model

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.370 
power amp and you have your amp model
right<00:04:19.340> here<00:04:19.670> now<00:04:20.239> for<00:04:20.540> this<00:04:20.630> one<00:04:20.840> I'm<00:04:20.989> using<00:04:21.170> an

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
right here now for this one I'm using an

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.980 
right here now for this one I'm using an
energy<00:04:21.590> ball<00:04:22.120> which<00:04:23.120> is<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.300> clone<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.570> an<00:04:23.810> amp

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
energy ball which is a clone of an amp

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.390 
energy ball which is a clone of an amp
and<00:04:25.210> you've<00:04:26.210> got<00:04:26.450> tons<00:04:27.230> of<00:04:27.560> controls<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.310> know

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
and you've got tons of controls you know

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640 
and you've got tons of controls you know
your<00:04:28.910> standard<00:04:29.240> controls<00:04:29.810> right<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:30.380> but

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
your standard controls right here but

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.580 
your standard controls right here but
then<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.860> get<00:04:31.220> into<00:04:31.930> things<00:04:32.930> where<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.440> get

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
then you get into things where you get

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.130 
then you get into things where you get
into<00:04:33.800> your<00:04:33.890> depth<00:04:34.160> dab<00:04:34.550> damping<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.720> your<00:04:35.870> sag

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
into your depth dab damping and your sag

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.040 
into your depth dab damping and your sag
and<00:04:36.530> all<00:04:36.920> of<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.600> then<00:04:38.600> we<00:04:38.720> come<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
and all of that then we come to the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.450 
and all of that then we come to the
cabinet<00:04:39.440> simulator<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.070> right<00:04:40.280> now<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
cabinet simulator and right now the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.550 
cabinet simulator and right now the
cabinet<00:04:41.030> simulator<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.660> me<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.960> more<00:04:42.200> for<00:04:42.440> my

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
cabinet simulator for me is more for my

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.830 
cabinet simulator for me is more for my
in<00:04:42.770> ears<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.340> that's<00:04:43.670> just<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.060> have<00:04:44.480> a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
in ears and that's just so I have a

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.060 
in ears and that's just so I have a
constant<00:04:45.530> consistent<00:04:46.430> volume<00:04:46.730> from<00:04:47.720> there<00:04:48.070> we

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
constant consistent volume from there we

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.190 
constant consistent volume from there we
look<00:04:49.340> at<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.670> effects<00:04:50.090> loop<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.750> use<00:04:50.960> this

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
look at the effects loop and I use this

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.810 
look at the effects loop and I use this
to<00:04:51.440> actually<00:04:51.560> these<00:04:51.950> these<00:04:52.370> are<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.640> outs

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
to actually these these are the outs

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.340 
to actually these these are the outs
that<00:04:53.180> are<00:04:53.300> actually<00:04:53.630> running<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.140> power

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
that are actually running to the power

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.990 
that are actually running to the power
amp<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.860> if<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.070> notice<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.340> splits<00:04:55.790> off

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
amp so if you notice that splits off

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.580 
amp so if you notice that splits off
before<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.630> cabinet<00:04:56.840> simulator

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
before the cabinet simulator

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.560 
before the cabinet simulator
I<00:04:58.620> run<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.100> directly<00:04:59.490> into<00:04:59.670> my<00:04:59.820> power<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.300> to

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
I run that directly into my power out to

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.800 
I run that directly into my power out to
the<00:05:00.900> cabinets<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.670> live<00:05:02.940> sound<00:05:03.480> is

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the cabinets and so the live sound is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.570 
the cabinets and so the live sound is
going<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.200> through<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.560> real<00:05:04.890> cabinet<00:05:05.400> and

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
going to be through the real cabinet and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.340 
going to be through the real cabinet and
then<00:05:05.940> my<00:05:06.150> inner<00:05:06.390> sound<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.990> through<00:05:07.200> the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
then my inner sound is through the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.440 
then my inner sound is through the
cabinet<00:05:07.770> simulator<00:05:08.060> another<00:05:09.060> thing<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.420> I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
cabinet simulator another thing that I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.540 
cabinet simulator another thing that I
use<00:05:09.660> quite<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.020> bit<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.770> intelligent<00:05:11.370> pitch

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
use quite a bit is the intelligent pitch

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.460 
use quite a bit is the intelligent pitch
shift<00:05:11.850> when<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.300> need<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.600> do<00:05:12.900> some<00:05:13.170> sort<00:05:13.350> of<00:05:13.380> a

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
shift when I need to do some sort of a

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.060 
shift when I need to do some sort of a
harmony<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:15.770> 1320<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> have<00:05:17.040> a

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
harmony like I do in 1320 I have a

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.280 
harmony like I do in 1320 I have a
harmony<00:05:17.610> that's<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:18.000> diminished<00:05:18.540> fifth<00:05:18.660> I<00:05:19.140> also

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
harmony that's a diminished fifth I also

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.580 
harmony that's a diminished fifth I also
have<00:05:19.620> one<00:05:19.920> that's<00:05:19.950> an<00:05:20.430> a-minor<00:05:21.270> up<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.290> third

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
have one that's an a-minor up a third

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.000 
have one that's an a-minor up a third
and<00:05:22.920> f-sharp<00:05:23.310> minor<00:05:24.030> down<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.630> third<00:05:25.080> for<00:05:25.710> small

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
and f-sharp minor down a third for small

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.100 
and f-sharp minor down a third for small
little<00:05:26.370> parts<00:05:26.700> within<00:05:27.030> that<00:05:27.210> solo<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.990> know

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
little parts within that solo you know

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.810 
little parts within that solo you know
things<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.560> harmonized<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.490> studio

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
things that I harmonized in the studio

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.850 
things that I harmonized in the studio
that<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:30.750> couldn't<00:05:31.050> recreate<00:05:31.470> live

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
that you just couldn't recreate live

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.730 
that you just couldn't recreate live
without<00:05:32.540> you<00:05:33.540> know<00:05:33.630> harmonize<00:05:34.170> are<00:05:34.410> doing<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
without you know harmonize are doing it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.010 
without you know harmonize are doing it
for<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.310> again<00:05:36.030> you<00:05:36.420> could<00:05:36.540> route<00:05:36.780> these

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
for you and again you could route these

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.500 
for you and again you could route these
so<00:05:37.440> differently<00:05:37.950> than<00:05:38.250> most<00:05:38.790> any<00:05:39.030> other<00:05:39.210> unit

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
so differently than most any other unit

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.060 
so differently than most any other unit
I've<00:05:39.630> used<00:05:39.900> that's<00:05:40.170> that's<00:05:40.500> one<00:05:40.740> thing<00:05:40.920> that's

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
I've used that's that's one thing that's

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.580 
I've used that's that's one thing that's
really<00:05:41.370> cool<00:05:41.700> about<00:05:41.730> this<00:05:42.150> unit<00:05:42.420> so<00:05:42.720> this<00:05:43.410> is

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
really cool about this unit so this is

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.540 
really cool about this unit so this is
actually<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:44.670> guts<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.480> my<00:05:46.200> tone<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.620> in

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550
