00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.859
 it was more or less said that she had been 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 created written for funeral 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.380
 of henri iv and that she was she would have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 been given several times after 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.410
 royal funeral a family of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.510
 members of the royal family 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 it's a bit of a legend 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 in truth this work dates from all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.170
 end of the sixteenth century to say 497 to little 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.079
 near and what is particularly 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 interesting in this work is that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.460
 it is at the same time a work of the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 Renaissance 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 the climax of rebirth and who 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.629
 already foreshadows and especially in the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.110
 last pour in the August time the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.409
 released but here is the baroque music 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.619
 with his passions with his shadows and his 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.619
 lights 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 what precedes the mass 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.400
 we are still in the music of 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.660
 spheres with this polyphony 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.390
 incredibly well done 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.620
 each of the parties of the five parties of the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.100
 heart weaves a kind of counterpoint 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.040
 who are spinning in space 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.860
 really that's the design of the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.920
 renaissance music and even 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.920
 from before the queue already music of the spheres 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 and 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.680
 and the more we go towards the end of mass I 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.800
 would say more the the speech the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.740
 counterpoint focus are becoming scarce 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.950
 and more and more we have effects 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.950
 really great theater theaters 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.950
 sacred 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.390
 and especially at the end of the libera when the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.890
 music evokes the last judgment with 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.700
 the earthquake 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.710
 the flame that will ignite the whole universe 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.710
 is this quite striking 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.270
 and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.670
 this is a structure that is when 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.040
 even very highly developed but of a 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.650
 almost architectural way by the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.209
 polyphony by the different sequences 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.100
 like that of the polyphonic group and the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.220
 blow in fact we really need to be 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.530
 extremely concentrated to be able to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.250
 direct our field with the correctness the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.840
 more precise and at the same time also a 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.840
 some freedom in interpretation 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.750
 Oh 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.750
 1 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.910
 there is above all wind instruments 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.470
 the sackbut who are the ancestors 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.960
 paperclips the book horn as well 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.630
 that the instrument that is the instrument 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.470
 must of all parishes 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.150
 from France and that until the beginning of the 20th 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.570
 century namely the snake the snake 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.930
 who were tasked 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.690
 to accompany the full field of dd 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.880
 precisely the singers not to detonate 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.310
 so it's an instrument that has a 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.410
 tessiture close to a baritone voice 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.630
 as we might call it 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.090
 today let's say that between the bass 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.700
 and the tenors the snake can double to 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.840
 both bass and tenor and the 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.750
 full field is usually a 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.700
 little bit about riding on these two 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.230
 tessitura at the level of the stamp what is 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.570
 very particular actually is that the 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.500
 snake develops a small number 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.780
 harmonics but that comes complete in 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.170
 does a frequency zone that is 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.550
 left completely blank by voice 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.730
 and that's what really makes the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.280
 complementarity between the snake and the 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.720
 singing is what also makes it possible not to 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.940
 actually compete with the 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.470
 understanding of the text 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.420
 so we see that it's something that 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.210
 was today we can visualize 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.560
 thanks to acoustic studies but who 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.210
 at the time and we were very very good 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.280
 understood by the manufacturers 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.610
 of instruments and by musicians 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.610
 themselves 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.159
 it's still a work that we 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.580
 are slowly moving towards acceptance 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.849
 of death 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.810
 i would even say like like bach more 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.599
 late the desire of death until then 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.800
 that this is properly du caurroy 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.930
 but at the end of the Mass we have 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
 full field and it's sung by the 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.599
 pages it was always sung by the 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.520
 children 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:09.949
 the in paradise is there for the occasion 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.620
 I bring children up to 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.789
 the platform and that's where they go 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.520
 sing 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.870
 here he is the final plainchant in his 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.569
 absolute destitution 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.569
 we have more than the voice of angels 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:42.320
 the greatness of this work comes from them 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.710
 his humility his simplicity in setting 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.710
 implemented 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.510
 we 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.409
 Oh 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.080
 m 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.440
 c 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 and 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.070
 Oh 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.070
 it is 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.560
 Oh
