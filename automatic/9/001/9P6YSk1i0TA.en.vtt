back into the debate on the mode and
that's<00:00:55.010> when<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.429> affect<00:00:55.789> this<00:00:56.570> rear<00:00:56.870> drag

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
that's when you affect this rear drag

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.220 
that's when you affect this rear drag
it's<00:00:58.370> also<00:00:58.519> got<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.300> front<00:00:59.510> drag<00:00:59.840> which<00:01:00.019> is

the natural plane drag of the reel so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.049 
the natural plane drag of the reel so
that<00:01:03.559> means<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.980> can<00:01:04.129> set<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.640> can<00:01:04.790> pre
