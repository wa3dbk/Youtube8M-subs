00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:11.519
 hello friends today i want 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:16.740
 make a very important addition to my 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.740
 video about the carbine for quick 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.830
 disconnecting laziness 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:27.680
 from gun rifle who do not know and to whom 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 I wonder what will be discussed 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.980
 can watch my video by clicking here 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 this tab 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 while I used rope lines with 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.020
 I didn't have this carbine 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.350
 problems lately I switched to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 monolith of cord 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.640
 for lawnmower this appeared 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.920
 such an unpleasant phenomenon as 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.890
 spontaneous line from 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 shot carbine 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 there were a couple of unpleasant moments on the hunt 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 when i watched the runaway from 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.509
 has the harpoon always succeeded me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.770
 find 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.360
 since the tench is bright yellow and even 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 in not very clear water 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's clear why it became so 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.360
 what happens is that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:40.259
 the court has a so-called memory that is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:45.119
 if somewhere there is a bend and the court is long 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.979
 is in a tense position then this 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 bend 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.159
 stays when ling is wound out like 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.149
 the usual on the cord appears here such 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.649
 bend when firing this bend apparently 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.579
 forms some kind of lever which 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.200
 turns the tench out of the hook of course 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.069
 one could refuse this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.600
 designs but for some reason I 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.380
 attached to this carbine 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.620
 it is very convenient to use at night when 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.680
 have to shoot a lot and especially 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 in the winter my winter hunting takes place on 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.410
 the river and always at night in winter my conditions 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.260
 the hunt is such that I always put out 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.780
 coil just with the coil even when 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.210
 no use of cord 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.540
 since it does not come from the coil and together 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.240
 carbine connection does not have a loop 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.150
 a reset results in a straight line 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.610
 that is, this lever is absent in the summer I 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.590
 almost never use a coil 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.390
 summer hunting conditions are such that 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.520
 enough to have guns 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.910
 tench shock absorber usually this reed 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.250
 hunt but here as I told me 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 waited a very unpleasant surprise like me 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.560
 got out of this situation really 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.260
 very simple i fixed the lines not on 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 the end of the receiver as usual and at the base 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:34.990
 handles here do not deserve the Mohawk service 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:41.010
 from the firm taimen, I just removed the comb 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:47.770
 and on the very basis of the Iroquois secured 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:51.880
 lines shock absorber well if it were not 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:55.510
 i would have a mohawk i would do homemade 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.850
 clamp or bought finished store now 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.990
 when wound together connections 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.170
 carbine pig straight line what else 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.670
 I want to say soon very soon summer 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.430
 let's go fishing for underwater hunting 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.440
 muddied kebabs and we will have everything 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.440
 ok see you
