00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
landing i guess anywhere and this isn't
really<00:00:28.859> matter<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.849> i<00:00:30.090> found<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> best

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
really matter and it i found the best

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
really matter and it i found the best
place<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> r<00:00:31.980> comanch<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
place to do it is at the r comanch and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
place to do it is at the r comanch and
i'm<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.450> sure<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:33.840> other<00:00:33.930> places<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
i'm pretty sure there's other places you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
i'm pretty sure there's other places you
could<00:00:34.800> probably<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.440> place<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
could probably do this but this place is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
could probably do this but this place is
pretty<00:00:38.160> high<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.270> place

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
pretty high and this is the first place

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
pretty high and this is the first place
i<00:00:39.809> thought<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> um<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
i thought of so um what we want to do is
