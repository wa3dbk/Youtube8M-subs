00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello I am the eldest I know 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.280
 climbing profession and I'm going to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 present today what kind of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.410
 slippers it exists and how do 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 to choose 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.199
 there are three major categories of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 slippers the ballerinas so without 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.750
 Velcro laces without the simple 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 velcros so ground indicates with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.930
 velcro and finally the third laces 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 in these three different categories 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.489
 there is also the camber and also can 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 to be very very different from slippers to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 the other example we take the show are there 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 this is normal and to press us 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.450
 at first sight there is no 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 difference 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.870
 and yet pina it is normal to profile 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.739
 the sole of one is very flat then 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 that the other is very arched obviously 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.090
 according to your level and type of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
 practice yourself and choose a slipper or 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 each other having some 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 different technical characteristics 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.270
 then the advantage is that the yaw 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 to have a tightening at the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 slipper which is very very regular and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 especially very accurate we can really 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 tight in tip here you see in will be 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 stronger at the beginning and - at the end we 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 can see a uniform tightening the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 foot maintenance also will be better 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.850
 obviously but the disadvantage because it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.500
 must know one thing is that we have this 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 case there so when things are very 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 very small compared to sneakers or 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 conventional shoes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 toes are enough folded there is one so 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 pressure more or less pressure 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.520
 strong which is exerted on the foot and this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.869
 pressure is more or less pleasant 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.939
 so when you have to remove the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.729
 slippers there it's obviously it puts 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.439
 of time so you have to choose the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.420
 laces for a type of climbs well 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.229
 specific and you will take a whole 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.189
 little less tight than for example 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.899
 velcro or even worse 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.390
 ballerinas which they will have to be 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.960
 extremely tight 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.060
 why ballerinas etc are 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.469
 enclosed in relation to the laces all 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 simply because they have no 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.310
 clamping means 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.260
 there we had the big on the previous ones 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.360
 we had the laces but there is no 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.900
 nothing like the foot has to be very 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.750
 compress 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.860
 because the rubber and very adherent it does not 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.330
 should not they play in 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.760
 slippers that the foot does not move 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 absolutely not on the sides nor before 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.709
 back because you risk blisters 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.920
 even meaning and especially because we 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.080
 use talent for example if you 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.930
 do not have you have your hands you 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.430
 tomorrow at a certain height and your 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.510
 feet are really very very low and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.430
 in between you absolutely do not have 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.900
 no holds to put your feet 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.519
 do not have a choice you have to go up 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.350
 so it sounds amazing but you 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.959
 have to step up to the level of 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.040
 hands for example to pose the talent of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.930
 shoot on your both legs what you 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.480
 will progress to look for 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.010
 the next take with you 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.810
 a slipper of escala of not being used 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.970
 that in a sense is to say that we 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.040
 do not use that sole as one 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
 use with sneakers we use 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.300
 also the sole obviously be it 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.330
 in support in front support or support 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.660
 precise on the sides one uses or if the 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.820
 heel and the top of the foot for the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.220
 point so same as for the no 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.470
 it's in really exceptional cases 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.660
 where you can not use your hands 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.299
 you need to clear hand and you 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.519
 are very unbalanced enough 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.680
 to go get either the art is either a 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.959
 big catch with the tip for 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.630
 allow to continue to evolve too 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.019
 another pretty important factor 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.829
 lacombe what's called symmetry and 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.609
 a hyper asymmetry a slipper 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.140
 symmetrical 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.579
 let's know that the same forms enough 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.090
 basic not aggressive at all 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.760
 foot 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.120
 you saw at the form level under the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.220
 sole 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.680
 this normal and if they have the same profile 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.600
 it's his plans that's a show are 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.840
 very comfortable usually dedicated to 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.959
 great voices at the cliff in general the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.210
 same show are so with laces so 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.910
 the difference with this one knows that 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.610
 the shape is more pronounced this 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.170
 we had what we will call one as well 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.760
 metric or a hyper asymmetric 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.640
 there we go in very slippers 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.530
 very technical much more accurate than 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.810
 the previous one if we look at the profile of 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.370
 the sole we see that like this 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.710
 very burst which allows to have 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.660
 much more power at the level of 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.150
 toes and at the end of the slipper that you 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.610
 make voice or block 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.580
 no matter it's mostly your foot that 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.810
 will determine the model and the brand of the 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.150
 slipper as we said before 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.400
 the show must be very, very 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.380
 close to the foot if the shape of the slipper 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.710
 does not fit your foot shape 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.240
 it gives you intense pain 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 pain that we will feel 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.010
 level of the toes the toes 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.170
 very sharp pain 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.760
 what does it mean that your 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.680
 toes are too compressed here 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.690
 in other words, the shape of the slipper 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.300
 is too cut off if you have a foot 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.640
 rather square or a foot earlier end 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.750
 and rounded dachau are to each other it's going 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.610
 to be day and night 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.800
 so to properly choose his show are in 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.930
 it must be the most 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.660
 tight possible but that you feel 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.460
 a uniform pressure around the foot in 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.740
 conclusion I gave you the basics 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.840
 to choose your slippers but especially 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.310
 do not hesitate to seek advice from 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.450
 vendors who are specialized and who 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.450
 are there to help us
