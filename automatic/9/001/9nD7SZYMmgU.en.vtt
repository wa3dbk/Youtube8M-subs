00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.750
 there in the valley near Kassel has about 6500 inhabitants what a 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.760
 Population density of approximately 159 inhabitants per square kilometer 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.559
 corresponds to fear of a food crisis 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.550
 Citizens do not have to import it is considered more harmful 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.919
 never and ensures neat supplies 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.340
 At a short distance there is an aldi market 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.600
 opposite a big GDK full-range and a bit 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.660
 continue a dear market that exists for 28 years 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.220
 to complete the whole now is still a net market 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.210
 people opened him in the valley are angry 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.450
 he was as superfluous as a goiter 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.880
 that's my opinion about it, we see more like well taken care of in St and that's why 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.010
 we would not have done it 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.820
 also and the information policy that was operated in the planning phase 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.720
 the affected understand something else 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.100
 No we were completely surprised we wanted to buy very good people 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.510
 Neighbors learn 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.550
 or simply presented 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 one has discussions in this regard also Neumayer 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.239
 Competitor Wertheim 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.140
 but he did not want to answer previous years and now it was easier 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980
 it has already become a hard bread 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.660
 not all can withstand the competition 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.100
 and fear for their existence 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 how do you see your future prospects? 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.780
 not by a pink glasses very realistically the time to decide 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 to survive or not if they close their market now 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.649
 Before the four employees would have to stand on the street 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.670
 very much people would go out on the street 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.220
 she gets almost all 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.280
 so there are no cheap workers anywhere like in 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.580
 other companies are employed 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 So it's 90 percent permanent 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.330
 not because he's scared ten percent 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.610
 marginally employed 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.530
 We also have the first chairman of the Business Association Bad in the valley 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.680
 asked about the current situation 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.500
 Mr. Frankfurt 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.499
 Ivica Aldi and now also a net market 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.140
 in a place with just 6500 inhabitants 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.600
 how did you not do your homework? 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.570
 Of course, there are many retailers here in the community 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.149
 difficult 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.679
 it is difficult for us to estimate the proma as a whole 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.399
 but problematic in order you have to see 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.290
 which is well known that the Editha market here in town 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.510
 first learned about it in his own construction phase 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.770
 that only a few meters further on a new net market was in the starting blocks 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.209
 was there on the part of the operator input or protests 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.980
 Year around 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.750
 that had a personal conversation with the few others 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.480
 led by the new purchase in Waddens valley and of course has major concerns 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.199
 and to understand that as well 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.089
 Essener was also challenged by the pure trade association 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.159
 Of course, you then need a significant mandate per cent 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.069
 the members of what we in the form could not hold so but due 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 weak, for example, with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.589
 Of course, this is also viewed critically by Modern m1 Landesverband 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.459
 Not everyone has been criticizing the new market 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 There are positive reactions there 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.169
 everything is going to be great gear deals 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.279
 I come from some days 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.249
 so 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.440
 the picture looks just as good 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.360
 we have 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.660
 at least a little more than the LG Karlstadt 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.810
 more offers 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.709
 who will be cheap 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.889
 the average sales area for food in Germany per 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.069
 a thousand inhabitants 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.419
 Petric the Hamburg 380 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.219
 in Stuttgart 395 in Munich four undergo 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.159
 and in Bad Emstal 680 square meters 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.980
 This makes the patent valley one of the best in Germany and better 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.209
 supplied as a team to major cities it would want the extra 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.829
 Area occupancy was decided only by the municipality board of the 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.549
 Council Butt no longer questioned 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.019
 also mentioned by the chairman of the trade association and in foil 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.559
 Expertises were given to that order 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.430
 remains to be seen if the Bad Emstaler will soon be one 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.969
 possible Nauen settlement of Wedel then to the lonely top than Germany 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.680
 best worried community settle anyway has mayor Ralf 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.290
 Pfeiffer, who was unwilling to comment 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.039
 its election promise more settlement of commercial space comprehensively fulfilled
