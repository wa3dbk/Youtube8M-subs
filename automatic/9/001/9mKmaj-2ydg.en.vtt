 bleached teacher juniors whom I have 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.560
 the pleasure of knowing about a time 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.740
 back and with which I really wanted to 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.289
 have a master talk in two years in 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.199
 this blessed sport 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.739

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.170
 fighter 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.930
 thank you very much to god and health above all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.010
 important because already 62 years already hang 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 but look we're still fighting 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 thank you very much contrary not the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.670
 appears master in the last edition 10 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.559
 by masks 32 we were in a very 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 Noble cause 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.570
 how do you see the reaction of people to 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.309
 want to support so many colleagues who do not 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.710
 it's because they do not want to be 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.420
 above the ring but the injuries already 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.119
 they do not let us know what the reaction was 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.549
 of the people is sad and regrettable to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.100
 to see a fellow hurt by 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.460
 example here I see 1 to 32 very fellow 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.500
 hurt they tell me hey how do you do 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 to keep well and that the other 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.600
 very easy game the life of an athlete 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.880
 It's like a rope clock according to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.740
 right to the clock and going to walk by 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.570
 you always wind up to the left what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 you're going to thunder and that's what happens with 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.070
 we really many times have 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.570
 some indiscipline and we go for the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 left and what happens to us 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.530
 but thank God here we are right now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 but it is unfortunate to see the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.870
 comrades because it's sad because it's 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.210
 like my family if I see my daughter is 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.060
 here present sick or something I wear 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.780
 sad or my wife or you who is a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.820
 friend mate and everything and a companion 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.890
 same as the new hurt and I feel bad 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.430
 I feel sad hear what I can do for 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.140
 you or is just exactly master always 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.000
 present in the most expensive exhibitions 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.860
 I really have little time to visit 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.930
 this event that this was what I 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.360
 fell in love more with the fight because 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.459
 lets have them in contact know them 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.709
 as human beings like what we are 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.230
 saying it as people who also 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.290
 suffers also gets sick also laughs 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 You also cry, always ready to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 these expensive sponges like this is this me what 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.940
 I do unconditionally with the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.820
 fellowship if I can contribute something what 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.590
 contributed and if not also contributed it because 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.720
 because we are human independently 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.810
 because we are human many times 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.790
 we have needs we have shortcomings 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.940
 we do not know or we do not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.849
 notice for shame for ethics by 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.920
 professionalism or X but we're on 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.020
 agreement we are human as humans all 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.849
 can happen to us that's exactly what I say 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.760
 I walk here I can fall or 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.480
 hurt or something not missing is not missing 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.090
 the partner got up because he should see 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.569
 partner himself must see brotherhood 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.200
 because because we are a family we live 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.380
 most of the time together almost 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.720
 almost more than with our family 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.330
