it<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.599> amazingly<00:00:01.260> simple<00:00:01.760> these<00:00:02.760> two<00:00:03.060> wheels

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
it is amazingly simple these two wheels

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.450 
it is amazingly simple these two wheels
are<00:00:03.659> mounted<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:04.140> separate<00:00:04.620> axles<00:00:05.190> and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
are mounted on separate axles and

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.870 
are mounted on separate axles and
supported<00:00:06.330> by<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.509> frame<00:00:07.340> so<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.519> they<00:00:08.639> can

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
supported by a frame so that they can

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.249 
supported by a frame so that they can
revolve<00:00:09.269> freely<00:00:10.050> at<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:11.550> speeds<00:00:12.259> let's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
revolve freely at different speeds let's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.300 
revolve freely at different speeds let's
fasten<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.860> spoke<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.960> inner<00:00:16.199> end<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.770> each

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
fasten a spoke on the inner end of each

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
fasten a spoke on the inner end of each
axle<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.740> by<00:00:19.890> turning<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> spokes<00:00:21.500> we

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
axle so that by turning the spokes we

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
axle so that by turning the spokes we
can<00:00:22.740> turn<00:00:23.039> each<00:00:23.369> wheel<00:00:23.670> separately<00:00:28.910> with<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
can turn each wheel separately with a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.650 
can turn each wheel separately with a
bar<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.689> cross<00:00:31.140> piece<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:33.090> turn<00:00:33.329> both

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bar or cross piece we can turn both

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
bar or cross piece we can turn both
wheels<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> same<00:00:35.040> direction<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.989> same

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
wheels in the same direction at the same

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.549 
wheels in the same direction at the same
rate<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> speed<00:00:38.840> let's<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
rate of speed let's get something to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
rate of speed let's get something to
hold<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.950> bar<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.460> place<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.050> will

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
hold this bar in place so that it will

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.520 
hold this bar in place so that it will
press<00:00:43.530> against<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> spokes<00:00:45.379> notice<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
press against the spokes notice that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
press against the spokes notice that
this<00:00:46.770> support<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.730> locked<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> axle

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this support is not locked to the axle

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.450 
this support is not locked to the axle
it<00:00:49.530> turns<00:00:49.950> freely<00:00:51.020> now<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.980> spin<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it turns freely now we can spin the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.170 
it turns freely now we can spin the
wheels<00:00:53.670> by<00:00:54.390> rotating<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> support<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
wheels by rotating the support this is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.049 
wheels by rotating the support this is
fine<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.840> long<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.649> both<00:00:59.129> wheels<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.699> able<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
fine as long as both wheels are able to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.860 
fine as long as both wheels are able to
turn<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> same<00:01:00.809> speed<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.690> let's<00:01:03.690> see

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
turn at the same speed but let's see

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
turn at the same speed but let's see
what<00:01:04.049> happens<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:05.070> around<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
what happens when we go around the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.990 
what happens when we go around the
corner<00:01:06.020> with<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.229> arrangement<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:08.549> cannot

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
corner with this arrangement we cannot

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.510 
corner with this arrangement we cannot
drive<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.720> wheel<00:01:10.020> faster<00:01:10.920> than<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> other

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.539 

and<00:01:15.770> if<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> stop<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.850> wheel<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:20.130> other<00:01:20.310> wheel

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and if we stop one wheel the other wheel

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.499 
and if we stop one wheel the other wheel
won't<00:01:20.880> budge

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.249 

let's<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> bar<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> pivot<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
let's put this bar on a pivot so that it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.290 
let's put this bar on a pivot so that it
can<00:01:28.500> swing<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.159> either<00:01:29.460> direction

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.830 

now<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> bar<00:01:38.190> can<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.790> turn<00:01:39.120> both<00:01:39.420> wheels

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
now the bar can still turn both wheels

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.770 
now the bar can still turn both wheels
at<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.950> speed<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.770> because<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.100> pivots

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
at the same speed and because it pivots

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.980 
at the same speed and because it pivots
it<00:01:45.780> lets<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.410> wheel<00:01:46.680> turn<00:01:47.480> even<00:01:48.480> when<00:01:48.870> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it lets one wheel turn even when the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.390 
it lets one wheel turn even when the
other<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.380> stopped<00:01:50.480> but<00:01:51.480> if<00:01:52.380> turned<00:01:52.800> too<00:01:53.070> far

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
other is stopped but if turned too far

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.840 
other is stopped but if turned too far
the<00:01:54.330> bar<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.870> swing<00:01:55.200> around<00:01:55.460> until<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> won't

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the bar will swing around until it won't

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.570 
the bar will swing around until it won't
drive<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.300> spokes<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.960> tourney<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> wheel

drive the spokes that tourney the wheel

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.200 
drive the spokes that tourney the wheel
we<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.750> another<00:02:01.050> crossbar<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.160> more<00:02:02.760> spokes

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
we need another crossbar and more spokes

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.610 
we need another crossbar and more spokes
to<00:02:03.570> carry<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> job<00:02:05.600> when<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.780> stop<00:02:07.080> one

to carry on the job when we stop one
wheel<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:09.149> crossbars<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:10.500> continue<00:02:11.070> to

can make our model more compact by

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.620 
can make our model more compact by
