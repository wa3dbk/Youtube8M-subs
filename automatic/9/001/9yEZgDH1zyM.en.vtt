charging<00:02:54.890> via<00:02:55.100> USB<00:02:55.580> cable<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:56.989> still<00:02:57.500> use

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
charging via USB cable you can still use

it<00:02:58.100> while<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.610> charging<00:02:58.850> which<00:02:59.209> i<00:02:59.420> think<00:02:59.480> is

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
it while it's charging which i think is

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.300 
it while it's charging which i think is
great<00:02:59.959> because<00:03:00.620> i<00:03:00.769> used<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.130> an<00:03:01.220> old
