00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.790
 you can choose among other things more 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.469
 cries parras the touring model of three by four bars and the short pasta of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.140
 double disk province the rubin is the absolute favorite for the work of 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.669
 shallow depth of stubble and in high fertilizer in green 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.589
 traditional crowds to coffee here its limit while the rubin is

 with speeds exceeding 12 kilometers an hour is achieved even with a

 body of three meters a huge enclosure per year 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.850
 the aspect of the work that is perfect the organic mass this time interspersed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.380
 intensely the upper soil granulated very finely and I also to minors 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.150
 depths of work of five to 10 centimeters in the best

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.480
 totally different mattel classics in what those bars a true but 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.110
 multifunctional if the soil is covered with volcanic material 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.879
 behind the plow with working depths of 10 centimeters to 15 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.690
 it's a lot short and mix safely we wanted to lattice type lattice 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.180
 to work the total surface and allow large distances between fixed 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 to understand implements and that disks with placed ends 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.610
 so that line for mixing

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.860
 the placement of the tools in the touring model that is similar 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.659
 0 the difference with the smapac is that the torito that is but dispensers that in three 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.370
 or four bars amazon 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.180
 also sector and that is designed for depths of work up to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.220
 30 centimeters 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.750
 the scams are evident a greater number of tools taking care of a mixture 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.760
 more intense and better longitudinal distribution making possible the best 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.020
 stubble work in the sowing mode on soils covered with 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.600
 contact material 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.579
 When you see carefully estoril the advantages are noted details

 tourist models 8 and 9 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.480
 of three bars work with a distance between rows of 25 centimeters 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.419
 they are equipped of series with tip xrack of 12 centimeters in width 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.059
 the ground cracks small parts 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.139
 if tourists 8 and 9 is used 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.589
 Fin type gratings are equipped to work positively and surfaces 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.790
 stores and achieve better surface yields 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.760
 the four bars of tornquist and in a row more remote attention between

 20 centimeters tours 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.219
 with it the maximum intensity quarter is achieved 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.549
 on the total surface the residual straw intensely mixed and the
