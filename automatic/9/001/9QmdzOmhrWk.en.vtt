00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
at the front there your engine is move

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.990 
at the front there your engine is move
so<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.590> need<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.860> get<00:02:00.979> your<00:02:01.100> engine<00:02:01.310> coming

right cheek
flip<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.170> over<00:02:36.120> till<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.240> tighten<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.630> up<00:03:01.290> once

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
flip it over till you tighten it up once

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.750 
flip it over till you tighten it up once
you<00:03:02.380> get<00:03:02.500> neon<00:03:02.740> up<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> bucket<00:03:03.280> opposition

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
you get neon up the bucket opposition

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.500 
you get neon up the bucket opposition
and<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.690> still<00:03:04.900> move<00:03:05.080> your<00:03:05.320> engine<00:03:09.510> pull

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
and it can still move your engine pull

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.260 
and it can still move your engine pull
your<00:03:10.660> engine<00:03:10.959> forward<00:03:14.730> give<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.970> good<00:03:16.150> old

know how to do it up shake depends on an
archetype<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:58.129> was<00:03:58.370> when<00:03:58.580> he<00:03:58.610> was<00:03:58.700> taking<00:03:59.120> it

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
archetype it was when he was taking it

00:03:59.239 --> 00:03:59.589 
archetype it was when he was taking it
off
