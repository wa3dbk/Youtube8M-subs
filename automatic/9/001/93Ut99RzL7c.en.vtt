00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
period which kind of makes me a little

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.949 
period which kind of makes me a little
disappointed<00:02:15.970> because<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.420> grew<00:02:16.840> up<00:02:16.900> with

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
disappointed because I grew up with

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.809 
disappointed because I grew up with
these<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.500> English<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.489> that's<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
these in English and that's how I

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.759 
these in English and that's how I
remember<00:02:19.390> them<00:02:19.480> that's<00:02:19.690> how<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.870> love<00:02:20.349> them<00:02:20.620> so

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
remember them that's how I love them so

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.920 
remember them that's how I love them so
I<00:02:21.099> am<00:02:21.430> disappointed<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.030> English<00:02:22.540> wasn't

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
I am disappointed that English wasn't

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
I am disappointed that English wasn't
even<00:02:23.110> an<00:02:23.230> option<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.920> Japanese<00:02:24.459> or<00:02:24.670> nothing

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
even an option it's Japanese or nothing

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.390 
even an option it's Japanese or nothing
it<00:02:25.780> was<00:02:25.989> good<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.560> these<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.280> first

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
it was good to see these for the first

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.040 
it was good to see these for the first
time<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.730> Japanese<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:28.269> I'd<00:02:28.360> never<00:02:28.510> heard

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
time in Japanese because I'd never heard

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.570 
time in Japanese because I'd never heard
him<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.260> Japanese<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.920> got<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.340> them<00:02:30.489> in

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
him a Japanese so I got to see them in

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.670 
him a Japanese so I got to see them in
their<00:02:30.670> native<00:02:31.030> language<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.080> still<00:02:32.440> really

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
their native language but I still really

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.289 
their native language but I still really
would<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.099> liked<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.459> have<00:02:33.519> had<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.819> option

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
would have liked to have had that option

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.020 
would have liked to have had that option
just<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> nostalgia<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.459> biggest

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
just for the nostalgia and the biggest

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.059 
just for the nostalgia and the biggest
thing<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.420> apparently<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.409> English<00:02:38.830> dub

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
thing is that apparently the English dub

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.039 
thing is that apparently the English dub
is<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.430> public<00:02:39.610> domain<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.510> I'm<00:02:40.720> not<00:02:40.810> quite

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
is in public domain so I'm not quite

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.140 
is in public domain so I'm not quite
sure<00:02:41.140> why<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.590> wasn't<00:02:42.099> included<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.909> set

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
sure why it wasn't included on the set

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.449 
sure why it wasn't included on the set
there<00:02:43.450> couldn't<00:02:43.810> be<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.959> rights<00:02:44.290> issue<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.890> I

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
there couldn't be a rights issue and I

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.670 
there couldn't be a rights issue and I
can't<00:02:45.850> say<00:02:46.060> there<00:02:46.270> was<00:02:46.420> no<00:02:46.959> more<00:02:47.170> space<00:02:47.470> left

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
can't say there was no more space left

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.520 
can't say there was no more space left
because<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
because it is a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.690 
because it is a
