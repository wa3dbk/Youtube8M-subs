00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
thing that I've ever done it took me

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
thing that I've ever done it took me
about<00:01:17.000> 20<00:01:18.000> minutes<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.810> cut

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
about 20 minutes to actually cut

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
about 20 minutes to actually cut
everything<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.490> together<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.270> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
everything and put it all together to be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
everything and put it all together to be
honest<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> took<00:01:22.140> longer<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> paint<00:01:22.979> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
