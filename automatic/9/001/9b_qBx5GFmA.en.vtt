often<00:00:01.290> when<00:00:01.469> we<00:00:01.500> are<00:00:01.709> asked<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.070> add<00:00:02.280> numbers

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
often when we are asked to add numbers

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.550 
often when we are asked to add numbers
we<00:00:03.270> can<00:00:03.389> just<00:00:03.600> do<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.990> our<00:00:04.110> head

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
we can just do it in our head

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.110 
we can just do it in our head
for<00:00:05.190> instance<00:00:05.640> 4<00:00:06.270> out<00:00:06.420> 5<00:00:06.690> equals<00:00:07.140> 9<00:00:07.379> or<00:00:07.880> 20<00:00:08.880> plus

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
for instance 4 out 5 equals 9 or 20 plus

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.169 
for instance 4 out 5 equals 9 or 20 plus
10<00:00:09.450> equals<00:00:09.780> 30<00:00:10.219> however<00:00:11.219> when<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.759> large

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
10 equals 30 however when we have large

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.720 
10 equals 30 however when we have large
numbers<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.929> can<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.590> trickier<00:00:14.070> for

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
numbers it can get a little trickier for

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.550 
numbers it can get a little trickier for
example<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.750> asked<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.940> 251<00:00:17.940> plus

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
example if I asked you what is 251 plus

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.439 
example if I asked you what is 251 plus
148<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:20.340> might<00:00:20.550> find<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.880> difficult<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
148 you might find that difficult to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.570 
148 you might find that difficult to
work<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.020> your<00:00:22.170> head<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:23.160> way<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> make

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
work out in your head the way to make

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
work out in your head the way to make
these<00:00:23.730> easier<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.630> follows<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.289> write<00:00:26.279> out

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
these easier is as follows we write out

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.250 
these easier is as follows we write out
one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.029> numbers<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.869> doesn't<00:00:28.050> matter

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
one of the numbers it doesn't matter

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
one of the numbers it doesn't matter
which<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.910> then<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> write<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
which one and then we write out the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
which one and then we write out the
other<00:00:30.810> number<00:00:31.230> directly<00:00:31.679> underneath<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
other number directly underneath it and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.330 
other number directly underneath it and
always<00:00:33.239> remember<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.320> must<00:00:34.649> keep<00:00:35.130> your

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
always remember that you must keep your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
always remember that you must keep your
columns<00:00:35.760> lined<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> units<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
columns lined up so the units of the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.389 
columns lined up so the units of the
second<00:00:38.460> number<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.300> case<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.780> eight<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
second number in this case the eight of

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.900 
second number in this case the eight of
148<00:00:41.399> must<00:00:42.180> always<00:00:42.480> always<00:00:43.230> always<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:44.610> under

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
148 must always always always go under

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
148 must always always always go under
the<00:00:45.030> units<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.260> number<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the units of the first number in this

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
the units of the first number in this
case<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.579> 1<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> 251<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.879> tens<00:00:51.180> column

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
case the 1 of the 251 the tens column

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
case the 1 of the 251 the tens column
must<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.350> lined<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.059> hundreds

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
must also be lined up and the hundreds

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.799 
must also be lined up and the hundreds
column<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.489> put<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.969> lines<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
column we then put two lines in and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.709 
column we then put two lines in and
proceed<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> add<00:00:58.829> each<00:00:59.070> column<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> numbers

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
proceed to add each column of numbers

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.000 
proceed to add each column of numbers
starting<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> unit's<00:01:01.350> column<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
starting with the unit's column on the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.550 
starting with the unit's column on the
right<00:01:02.190> hand<00:01:02.430> side<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.350> 1<00:01:04.350> plus<00:01:04.680> 8<00:01:04.979> gives<00:01:05.280> us<00:01:05.670> 9

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
right hand side so 1 plus 8 gives us 9

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
right hand side so 1 plus 8 gives us 9
moving<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> tens<00:01:08.159> column<00:01:08.340> 5<00:01:09.180> plus<00:01:09.450> 4

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
moving on to the tens column 5 plus 4

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
moving on to the tens column 5 plus 4
also<00:01:10.290> gives<00:01:10.560> us<00:01:10.740> 9<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.360> 2<00:01:12.360> plus<00:01:12.659> 1<00:01:12.960> gives<00:01:13.560> us<00:01:13.710> 3

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
also gives us 9 and 2 plus 1 gives us 3

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.359 
also gives us 9 and 2 plus 1 gives us 3
in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> hundreds<00:01:15.119> column<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.040> know

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
in the hundreds column so we now know

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
in the hundreds column so we now know
that<00:01:18.170> 251<00:01:19.170> plus<00:01:20.090> 148<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:22.009> 399<00:01:24.350> let's<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.530> at

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that 251 plus 148 is 399 let's look at

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.609 
that 251 plus 148 is 399 let's look at
another<00:01:25.860> question<00:01:29.119> 7378<00:01:30.229> plus<00:01:31.229> seven

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
another question 7378 plus seven

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.880 
another question 7378 plus seven
thousand<00:01:32.159> seven<00:01:32.549> hundred<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.119> fifteen<00:01:33.890> we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
thousand seven hundred and fifteen we

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
thousand seven hundred and fifteen we
lay<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.659> did<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
lay this out the same way as we did in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.920 
lay this out the same way as we did in
the<00:01:36.990> previous<00:01:37.200> example<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.540> then<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.630> start

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the previous example and then we start

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.859 
the previous example and then we start
adding<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.650> right<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> left<00:01:41.810> you'll<00:01:42.810> notice

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
adding from right to left you'll notice

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.670 
adding from right to left you'll notice
when<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.590> add<00:01:43.829> 8<00:01:44.100> &amp;<00:01:44.399> 5<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.390> 13<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
when we add 8 &amp; 5 we get 13 which is a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.429 
when we add 8 &amp; 5 we get 13 which is a
number<00:01:47.009> bigger<00:01:47.159> than<00:01:47.340> 10<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.899> instance

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
number bigger than 10 in this instance

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
number bigger than 10 in this instance
we<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.460> what's<00:01:50.729> called<00:01:50.970> carrying<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
we have to do what's called carrying the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.359 
we have to do what's called carrying the
number<00:01:51.990> across<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> next<00:01:52.979> column

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
number across to the next column

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.780 
number across to the next column
so<00:01:54.000> from<00:01:54.180> 8<00:01:54.360> plus<00:01:54.630> 5<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.680> 13<00:01:56.130> which

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
so from 8 plus 5 we get 13 which

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.530 
so from 8 plus 5 we get 13 which
contains<00:01:57.270> 3<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.079> its<00:01:58.259> units<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.520> put<00:01:59.759> 3<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
contains 3 in its units so we put 3 in a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.209 
contains 3 in its units so we put 3 in a
units<00:02:00.869> column<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:02.100> 13<00:02:02.579> also<00:02:02.909> contains<00:02:03.659> 110<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
units column but 13 also contains 110 so

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
units column but 13 also contains 110 so
we<00:02:05.340> need<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> transfer<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.420> 10<00:02:06.780> into<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
we need to transfer that 10 into the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.339 
we need to transfer that 10 into the
tens<00:02:07.740> column<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.479> proceed<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> add<00:02:10.170> up

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
tens column so then we proceed to add up

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.660 
tens column so then we proceed to add up
the<00:02:10.470> tens<00:02:10.739> column<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.330> 7<00:02:12.780> plus

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
the tens column and we have 7 plus

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.759 
the tens column and we have 7 plus
which<00:02:13.909> gives<00:02:14.180> us<00:02:14.269> eight<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.469> we<00:02:15.560> must

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
which gives us eight but we must

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.380 
which gives us eight but we must
remember<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.159> add<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.579> one<00:02:16.790> carried<00:02:17.239> over

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
remember to add the one carried over

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.490 
remember to add the one carried over
which<00:02:17.870> gives<00:02:18.140> us<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.379> total<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.769> nine<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:21.260> then

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
which gives us a total of nine we then

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.009 
which gives us a total of nine we then
add<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.769> hundreds<00:02:22.340> column<00:02:22.549> three<00:02:23.480> plus<00:02:23.780> seven

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
add the hundreds column three plus seven

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.220 
add the hundreds column three plus seven
which<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.590> ten<00:02:25.209> again<00:02:26.209> we<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.719> to<00:02:26.840> carry<00:02:27.049> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
which is ten again we have to carry the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.589 
which is ten again we have to carry the
run<00:02:27.379> across<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.010> put<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.609> zero<00:02:28.909> in<00:02:29.329> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
run across and put the zero in the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.080 
run across and put the zero in the
hundreds<00:02:29.989> column<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:31.040> finally<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.909> add<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
hundreds column and finally we add the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.569 
hundreds column and finally we add the
thousands<00:02:32.689> column<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.889> seven<00:02:34.280> plus

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
thousands column and we have seven plus

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.809 
thousands column and we have seven plus
7<00:02:35.000> which<00:02:35.269> is<00:02:35.329> 14<00:02:35.989> plus<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.219> carried<00:02:37.639> over

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
7 which is 14 plus the one carried over

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.170 
7 which is 14 plus the one carried over
which<00:02:38.329> is<00:02:38.480> 15<00:02:39.040> again<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.340> have<00:02:40.519> more<00:02:40.700> than<00:02:40.879> 10

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
which is 15 again we have more than 10

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.690 
which is 15 again we have more than 10
but<00:02:41.959> now<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.530> there<00:02:42.769> are<00:02:42.889> no<00:02:43.040> more<00:02:43.280> numbers<00:02:43.670> to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
but now as there are no more numbers to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
but now as there are no more numbers to
add<00:02:43.969> we<00:02:44.359> simply<00:02:44.810> put<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.170> entire<00:02:45.590> number<00:02:45.889> in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
add we simply put the entire number in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.759 
add we simply put the entire number in
between<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.879> lines<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.650> our<00:02:48.950> final<00:02:49.400> answer<00:02:49.609> is

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
between the lines so our final answer is

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.089 
between the lines so our final answer is
15,000<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.950> 93<00:02:53.169> so<00:02:54.169> now<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.379> can<00:02:54.680> add<00:02:54.799> any

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
15,000 and 93 so now you can add any

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.420 
15,000 and 93 so now you can add any
number<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:56.000> any<00:02:56.419> size<00:02:56.780> even<00:02:57.200> if<00:02:57.889> you're<00:02:58.069> asked

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
number of any size even if you're asked

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.809 
number of any size even if you're asked
to<00:02:58.459> add<00:02:58.609> three<00:02:58.939> numbers<00:02:59.150> for<00:03:00.019> instance<00:03:00.819> 754

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
to add three numbers for instance 754

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.909 
to add three numbers for instance 754
plus<00:03:02.739> 8901

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
plus 8901

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.240 
plus 8901
plus<00:03:04.750> 545<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.439> use<00:03:06.560> exactly<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:07.219> same

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
plus 545 you can use exactly the same

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.909 
plus 545 you can use exactly the same
method<00:03:07.669> just<00:03:08.540> line<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.379> numbers<00:03:09.739> and

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
method just line up all the numbers and

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.689 
method just line up all the numbers and
add<00:03:10.219> down<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.639> columns<00:03:11.000> from<00:03:11.239> right<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.510> left
