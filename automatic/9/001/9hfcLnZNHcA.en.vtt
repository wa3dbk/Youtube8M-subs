00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.830
 very good and that was deron minecraft 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.690
 to bring 1 may kraft 1.7 point 10 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.860
 called construction table works 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.630
 ok so you do not have to download it 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.189
 and install it and this module that does 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.260
 just the opposite that the table of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.119
 craft eo this build things is one of 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.860
 the bikes that add in crazy craft and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.300
 at the moment I have not reviewed so 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.250
 played then we have here the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.770
 construction table and just to 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.239
 be able to start the craft earth 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.100
 we are simply going to move an object by 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.660
 example a beat with we put the bacon and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 As you can see, he is going to return the five 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.140
 crystals is going to return the star of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.760
 underworld and the 32 and I no longer clicked 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.979
 and as you can see, he puts all the inventory 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.019
 I'm going to put it here and this for example 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.070
 go outside and outside because you have no more 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.750
 to stay or not 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.610
 however for example the lever I will 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 put for example give a few 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.839
 times to get eight for example 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.699
 eight sticks and stones that would be this 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.440
 lever that I have built after these 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.600
 sticks you can build again and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.010
 turn them into oak and this 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.479
 oak wood can return it to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.640
 rebuild and get back the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.830
 oak trunk then it's pretty 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 still the truth because I still get 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.549
 a trunk after having turned it 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.620
 everything in levers and so on, yes it is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.300
 a little weird but you can get it by 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.320
 example can be achieved with a breastplate 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.229
 of chainmail that we can 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.490
 somehow then we can fire and fire 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.720
 because you already know that the one who does or is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.400
 only fire then then 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.620
 we got another fire too 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.930
 we have the activator workshop for example 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.510
 I've been looking at that if for example 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.100
 we have an object in which it stays in 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.450
 several numbers for example the activator 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.070
 that is created this way and dad says' 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060
 so we have to put the six for 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.710
 get all the materials again 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.540
 as we will not only get a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.690
 iron ingot with two we would get 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 an iron Catholic and a and a stick 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.500
 with three we will get on Sunday 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.899
 iron with four we would get the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.430
 arrest nor iron tonic with five 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.380
 we will get another five iron and with 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.140
 six finally we would get the rest 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.700
 So yes, it is a truth 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 it's pretty good to some extent 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.170
 because at a certain moment you get to 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.000
 dive and I'm an expert in exploiting 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.890
 the bucs for now I will teach how to create 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.330
 we also have this table 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.010
 enchantment that for example well as 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.440
 You see we can also get it if 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.239
 the book reaches the diamond and now it 's 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.739
 when we start with the good it's worth 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.320
 example is to say that I have them from 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.350
 bars 16 when we make 6 the 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.330
 iron ingot true then with 14 already 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.850
 we can get back the 6 we put 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:36.160
 for example let's put here 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:38.590
 is 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and 14 and it gives us 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.500
 the 6 then with this I take 6 of 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.540
 iron here I do the crafter again 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.180
 get back 16 bars here 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.520
 I go back again to put 14 instead of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.720
 put 16 and good right now because 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.460
 I said it but if I had not 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.700
 put only with 14 would 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.980
 worked and so I have bars and good 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.200
 and infinite iron then this over here 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.900
 As you can see I have 6 iron and two 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.760
 bars I do this again and so 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.460
 is how he got bars from this 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.830
 way the truth is that it is a very bug 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.230
 very weird because it should not be but 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.460
 is then with this if we do it and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.290
 we are patients we can get 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.910
 lots of free irons because after 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.400
 this we have another 14 these 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.850
 bars that are the extras because we already 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.100
 they give to get more iron then 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.570
 it's pretty good it was very cool it 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.190
 can do this very well too 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.020
 we can do it for example with the wall 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.060
 of rock mosses to for example you know that 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.400
 this gives 5 do not 6 when we do it 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.269
 so it's worth 5 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.819
 and he gives us 6 and then we put 5 and good 5 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.189
 here we do not have to do this again 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.599
 we make this clear is that you have to 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.700
 doing it with 6 is true 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.280
 well here with 6 now this over here 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.930
 I leave 1 here I put 5 and it gives me 6 and so 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.730
 come back again to clone the rock 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.530
 mosses to we also have the rock wall 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.209
 works the same does the same thing you know 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.569
 it is 6 but with 5 we can already 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.980
 get it the crystal you also know 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.560
 That was 16 when we do the crafter 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.640
 but with 14 he also gives us the panels 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.310
 to remove therefore we can also 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.750
 have infinite panels or crystals 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.250
 we can also do it for example with 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.290
 the infra brick fence you know 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.459
 that with six already with six of infra 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.230
 bricks at six o'clock 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.609
 bricks but with five we can 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.380
 get this so we can also 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.380
 have infernal fence of them or infra 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.750
 infinite bricks then it is 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.610
 pretty good that you can block it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.960
 but of course it's also a bug I'm 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.389
 playing in multiplayer as they are 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.460
 us in the series because it is also a 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.960
 advantage and good really I need 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.400
 because an iron ingot so that without 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.990
 However, the bars could 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.990
 come well for the decoration and like 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.310
 I do the same as I do this for 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.330
 example could also come in handy 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.680
 rock wall 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.060
 so for example from there we can 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.920
 do it for example with the trap chest 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.020
 it would not be a trick anymore it's just a 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.030
 eat a chest trap is more of a hook 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.830
 rope and I catch the two and then the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.810
 I can convert it back to wood 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.120
 oak oak wood again in 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.010
 trunk and at the end as you see we have 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.650
 two trunks made from the trap chest 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.990
 not then then we also have another 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.310
 which is already good this apart from the 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.460
 content can also be built 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.350
 in its own thing or whatever the table 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.030
 crafter or also and apart from all this 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.500
 I'm going to all this because now we're going 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.420
 with weapons, weapons and weapons are worth 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.190
 tools when we have a weapon 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.720
 newly created let's say we created 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.520
 the father of mante but we did not want 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.260
 because in the end we do not lack anything 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.850
 lack diamond for something else because 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.650
 we put back and we get back 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.240
 the materials all the materials without 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.040
 However, when the sword is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.530
 minimally used although it is already 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.870
 just one touch a single point of 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.820
 durability damage as they no longer give us 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.180
 the diamonds only gives us one 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.310
 when it is seriously touched and only 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.620
 gives us the stick when it is already over 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.540
 half if I'm not wrong and when it 's 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.130
 already at zero durability we already know 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.240
 it's going to break I did not think you 're going to 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.630
 get materials why not 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.099
 here does not give us anything leaves us this 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.050
 as I can because this is already for you is 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.759
 this is the guys mode we no longer have 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.410
 nothing more than being able to do it with the 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.030
 armor with weapons and so on 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.979
 same thing that you just do with the sword and 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.440
 I'm going to use the new merit team in the 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.440
 next video and see you later
