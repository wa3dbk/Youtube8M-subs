you guys so this video is not one
hundred<00:00:17.760> percent<00:00:17.940> true<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.600> definitely

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
hundred percent true but it's definitely

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.210

not one hundred percent fake it's
definitely<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.880> fairly<00:00:21.750> large<00:00:21.900> possibility

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
definitely a fairly large possibility

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.679 
definitely a fairly large possibility
now<00:00:22.859> there's<00:00:23.070> nothing<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.519> quite<00:00:23.820> prove<00:00:24.420> that
