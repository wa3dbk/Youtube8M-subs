Milliken<00:00:56.100> wanted<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> charge<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> oil

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
Milliken wanted to charge the oil

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
Milliken wanted to charge the oil
droplets<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.570> he<00:00:57.660> ionized<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.410> surrounding

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
droplets so he ionized the surrounding

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.959 
droplets so he ionized the surrounding
air<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> bottomless<00:00:59.489> cylinder<00:00:59.820> with

he<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.140> connected<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.530> battery<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> two

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
he then connected the battery to the two

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
he then connected the battery to the two
plates<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> adjusted<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> voltage<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> them

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
plates and adjusted the voltage in them

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
plates and adjusted the voltage in them
until<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.470> electrical<00:01:04.920> field<00:01:05.129> strength<00:01:05.430> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
until the electrical field strength they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
until the electrical field strength they
created<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.480> strong<00:01:06.690> enough<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> suspend<00:01:07.410> a

it<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.470> easy<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.920> figure<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.460> much

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it was then easy to figure out how much

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240 
it was then easy to figure out how much
