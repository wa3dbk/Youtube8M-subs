00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
decorative pot the first trick is to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.419 
decorative pot the first trick is to
know<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.550> orchid<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.970> actually<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
know that your orchid is actually in a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
know that your orchid is actually in a
plastic<00:00:29.429> pot<00:00:29.609> inside<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> decorative<00:00:30.570> pot<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
plastic pot inside the decorative pot so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
plastic pot inside the decorative pot so
you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.289> lift<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you can just lift it out and take the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.889 
you can just lift it out and take the
orchid<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> plastic<00:00:33.390> pot<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
orchid out of the plastic pot so you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
orchid out of the plastic pot so you
want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.469> plant<00:00:34.680> tag<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.309> make

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
want to look for your plant tag and make

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
want to look for your plant tag and make
sure<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:35.969> lose<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:37.410> I'm

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
sure you don't lose it and then I'm

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
sure you don't lose it and then I'm
going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> gently<00:00:38.190> turn<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.640> orchid<00:00:38.969> over<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
going to gently turn my orchid over and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
going to gently turn my orchid over and
just<00:00:40.230> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.440> squish<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> pot<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.250> some

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just kind of squish the pot and some

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700 
just kind of squish the pot and some
orchids<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.300> sticky<00:00:42.690> roots<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.620> be

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
orchids have sticky roots so it can be

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.369 
orchids have sticky roots so it can be
difficult<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:46.079> might<00:00:46.200> want

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
difficult to get them out you might want

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
difficult to get them out you might want
to<00:00:46.410> wear<00:00:46.530> gloves<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.309> orchids<00:00:47.789> are

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to wear gloves because orchids are

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
to wear gloves because orchids are
potted<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.270> bark<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.750> may<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.050> splinters<00:00:49.440> in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
potted in bark you may have splinters in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.610 
potted in bark you may have splinters in
there<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> Spagna<00:00:50.640> moss<00:00:50.850> tends<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> have

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
there and Spagna moss tends to have

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
there and Spagna moss tends to have
prickly<00:00:52.620> thorns<00:00:53.039> inside<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> also<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.090> lot

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
prickly thorns inside of it also a lot

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
prickly thorns inside of it also a lot
of<00:00:54.360> growers<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.989> pesticides<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.920> fungicides

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
of growers use pesticides and fungicides

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
of growers use pesticides and fungicides
on<00:00:56.760> their<00:00:57.210> orchids<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.260> don't<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
on their orchids and you don't want to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
on their orchids and you don't want to
get<00:00:58.739> those<00:00:58.859> chemicals<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.460> bare<00:00:59.699> hands

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
get those chemicals on your bare hands

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270 
get those chemicals on your bare hands
you'll<00:01:00.750> notice<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.530> some<00:01:01.829> new<00:01:02.010> roots

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you'll notice there are some new roots

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
you'll notice there are some new roots
starting<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> turns

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
starting right here so when it turns

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
starting right here so when it turns
brown<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> white<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> yellow

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
brown to white and then that yellow

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
brown to white and then that yellow
little<00:01:05.670> tip<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> new<00:01:07.229> roots

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
little tip these are the new roots

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.880 
little tip these are the new roots
starting<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.790> sometimes<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.619> happened<00:01:10.619> with

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
starting so sometimes like happened with

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.429 
starting so sometimes like happened with
this<00:01:11.100> orchid<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.090> roots<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.080> packed

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this orchid the roots are really packed

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
this orchid the roots are really packed
together<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.189> they've<00:01:14.700> become<00:01:14.880> what's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
together and they've become what's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
together and they've become what's
called<00:01:15.270> pot<00:01:15.630> bounds<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> notice<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
called pot bounds so you notice that the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.550 
called pot bounds so you notice that the
roots<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.000> shape<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> pot<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
roots take on the shape of the pot this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
roots take on the shape of the pot this
will<00:01:19.799> discourage<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.610> plant<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.240> taking<00:01:21.689> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
will discourage the plant from taking up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
will discourage the plant from taking up
space<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> new<00:01:23.159> pot<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.729> sending<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
space in the new pot and sending the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.399 
space in the new pot and sending the
roots<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> go

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
roots out the way they need to go

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.719 
roots out the way they need to go
they'll<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.130> keep<00:01:26.340> growing<00:01:26.610> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
they'll just kind of keep growing in

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
they'll just kind of keep growing in
this<00:01:26.820> pattern<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> knock<00:01:28.409> them

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this pattern so we want to knock them

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
this pattern so we want to knock them
loose<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.579> order<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.030> break<00:01:30.299> them

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
loose but in order to not break them

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
loose but in order to not break them
they're<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.170> dried<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> stiff<00:01:31.950> right

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
they're a bit dried out and stiff right

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.640 
they're a bit dried out and stiff right
now<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> soak<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.299> some

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
now so I'm going to soak them in some

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
now so I'm going to soak them in some
water<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
water this water is actually got a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.899 
water this water is actually got a
solution<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.390> virus<00:01:39.840> ID<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.740> make<00:01:41.100> sure<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
solution of a virus ID to make sure that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
solution of a virus ID to make sure that
any<00:01:42.899> pathogens<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.649> might<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> plant

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
any pathogens that might be on the plant

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130 
any pathogens that might be on the plant
roots<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.509> killed<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> if

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
roots are going to get killed and if

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
roots are going to get killed and if
there's<00:01:46.320> any<00:01:46.530> root<00:01:46.770> rot<00:01:46.979> present<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
there's any root rot present that it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.550 
there's any root rot present that it
will<00:01:48.270> kill<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
will kill that also so I'm just going to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
will kill that also so I'm just going to
set<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> orchid<00:01:50.189> down<00:01:50.340> into<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
set the orchid down into it and I'm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.469 
set the orchid down into it and I'm
going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> let<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> soak<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> few<00:01:52.860> minutes

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
going to let it soak for a few minutes

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
going to let it soak for a few minutes
so<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.829> from<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.130> plant<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so as you can see from this plant just a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.620 
so as you can see from this plant just a
little<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.299> soaking<00:01:57.509> even

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
little bit of soaking even

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.350 
little bit of soaking even
and<00:01:58.750> make<00:01:59.369> pulling<00:02:00.369> apart<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.850> roots<00:02:01.060> much

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
and make pulling apart the roots much

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.380 
and make pulling apart the roots much
more<00:02:01.570> easy<00:02:01.840> because<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.460> roots<00:02:04.090> are

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
more easy because when the roots are

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.139 
more easy because when the roots are
saturated<00:02:05.259> they're<00:02:05.500> less<00:02:05.740> sticky<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:06.909> what

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
saturated they're less sticky so what

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.940 
saturated they're less sticky so what
I'm<00:02:07.240> doing<00:02:07.509> now<00:02:07.659> is<00:02:07.689> I'm<00:02:08.319> just<00:02:08.560> pulling<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
I'm doing now is I'm just pulling the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.210 
I'm doing now is I'm just pulling the
roots<00:02:09.160> apart<00:02:09.489> gently<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:11.349> do<00:02:11.530> snap<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.190> you

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
roots apart gently they do snap so you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.330 
roots apart gently they do snap so you
don't<00:02:12.430> want<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> be<00:02:12.700> too<00:02:12.849> rough<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.060> them<00:02:13.480> but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
don't want to be too rough with them but

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.559 
don't want to be too rough with them but
you<00:02:15.340> don't<00:02:15.519> have<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.910> too<00:02:16.030> gentle<00:02:16.300> if

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
you don't have to be too gentle if

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.300 
you don't have to be too gentle if
they're<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.930> saturated<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.860> lot<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.130> times

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
they're really saturated a lot of times

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.620 
they're really saturated a lot of times
they're<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.670> flexible<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.510> be

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
they're so flexible that you can be

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960 
they're so flexible that you can be
pretty<00:02:19.810> rough<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.440> general<00:02:21.430> thinner<00:02:21.670> roots

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
pretty rough in general thinner roots

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.199 
pretty rough in general thinner roots
are<00:02:22.269> easier<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:24.400> rough<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.030> thicker

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
are easier to be rough with and thicker

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.940 
are easier to be rough with and thicker
roots<00:02:25.480> tend<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> bit<00:02:26.170> more<00:02:26.319> brittle<00:02:26.709> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
roots tend to be a bit more brittle and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.180 
roots tend to be a bit more brittle and
more<00:02:27.640> difficult<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.540> break<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.980> what<00:02:30.099> I'm

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
more difficult to not break so what I'm

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.830 
more difficult to not break so what I'm
doing<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.519> I'm<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:30.730> looking<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.360> any<00:02:31.510> dead

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
doing is I'm just looking for any dead

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.229 
doing is I'm just looking for any dead
roots<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.349> might<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.769> inside<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.849> root<00:02:34.030> mass

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
roots that might be inside the root mass

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.330 
roots that might be inside the root mass
here<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.900> want<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> pull<00:02:35.290> those<00:02:35.440> ones<00:02:35.709> out<00:02:35.920> I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
here and I want to pull those ones out I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
here and I want to pull those ones out I
also<00:02:36.730> want<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.030> loosen<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.420> root<00:02:37.599> mass<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:38.019> so

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
also want to loosen the root mass up so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.530 
also want to loosen the root mass up so
that<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> goes<00:02:39.370> into<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> new<00:02:40.030> pot<00:02:40.269> it's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that when it goes into the new pot it's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.900 
that when it goes into the new pot it's
really<00:02:40.870> going<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.080> send<00:02:41.319> down<00:02:41.580> roots<00:02:42.580> into<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
really going to send down roots into the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.640 
really going to send down roots into the
whole<00:02:43.180> pot<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.690> spread<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.380> more<00:02:44.590> and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
whole pot and spread out a bit more and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
whole pot and spread out a bit more and
it's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.549> tightly<00:02:45.849> bound<00:02:46.150> up

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's not going to be so tightly bound up

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.860 
it's not going to be so tightly bound up
this<00:02:47.230> paphiopedilum<00:02:48.010> was<00:02:48.480> packed<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.630> bark

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
this paphiopedilum was packed in bark

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.360 
this paphiopedilum was packed in bark
mix<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.440> here<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.769> see<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> bark<00:02:51.190> mix

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
mix and here you can see the bark mix

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.890 
mix and here you can see the bark mix
and<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.549> see<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.849> fairly<00:02:52.030> fine<00:02:52.360> mix<00:02:52.599> and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
and you see it's a fairly fine mix and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.089 
and you see it's a fairly fine mix and
it's<00:02:53.200> actually<00:02:53.500> not<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.890> bad<00:02:54.069> of

it's actually not in that bad of

repot<00:03:07.840> them<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.709> really<00:03:08.920> high

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
repot them if you get a really high

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.770 
repot them if you get a really high
quality<00:03:09.250> bark<00:03:09.850> mix<00:03:10.090> something<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.600> been

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
quality bark mix something that's been

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.900 
quality bark mix something that's been
kiln<00:03:11.079> dried<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:12.250> might<00:03:12.400> get<00:03:12.549> two<00:03:12.700> or<00:03:12.850> three

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
kiln dried you might get two or three

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.520 
kiln dried you might get two or three
years<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:13.569> then<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> should<00:03:13.989> probably<00:03:14.109> go

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
years but then you should probably go

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.160 
years but then you should probably go
with<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.709> slightly<00:03:15.010> larger<00:03:15.280> pot<00:03:15.700> because

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
with a slightly larger pot because

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.849 
with a slightly larger pot because
they're<00:03:17.170> going<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.319> need<00:03:17.410> more<00:03:17.650> room<00:03:17.829> to

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
they're going to need more room to

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.890 
they're going to need more room to
expand<00:03:18.400> if<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.579> wait<00:03:18.790> longer<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.209> repot<00:03:19.630> in

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
expand if you wait longer to repot in

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.660 
expand if you wait longer to repot in
general<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.620> don't<00:03:20.829> want<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.069> go<00:03:21.160> with<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> pot

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
general you don't want to go with a pot

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.120 
general you don't want to go with a pot
that's<00:03:21.910> much<00:03:22.120> bigger<00:03:22.359> than<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.690> one<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
that's much bigger than the one the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.710 
that's much bigger than the one the
orchid<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.549> packed<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.030> or<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.389> could<00:03:25.540> even

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
orchid was packed in or you could even

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.789 
orchid was packed in or you could even
put<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.079> in<00:03:26.260> back<00:03:26.799> into<00:03:26.980> its<00:03:27.190> original<00:03:27.280> pot

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
put it in back into its original pot

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.670 
put it in back into its original pot
most<00:03:29.799> orchids<00:03:30.220> prefer<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.790> root<00:03:30.970> bound<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
most orchids prefer to be root bound and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.080 
most orchids prefer to be root bound and
it's<00:03:32.680> easier<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.250> overwater<00:03:33.730> them<00:03:33.819> if

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
it's easier to not overwater them if

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's easier to not overwater them if
they're<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.480> smaller<00:03:34.750> pot<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:36.579> what<00:03:36.670> I'm

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
they're in a smaller pot so what I'm

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.129 
they're in a smaller pot so what I'm
going<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.060> now<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.540> seem<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:37.959> gotten

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
going to do now I seem to have gotten

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.039 
going to do now I seem to have gotten
most<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.480> material<00:03:40.480> loosened<00:03:40.840> up<00:03:40.930> that

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
most of the material loosened up that

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.210 
most of the material loosened up that
I'm<00:03:41.139> going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.319> get<00:03:41.440> for<00:03:41.650> now<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.040> still

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
I'm going to get for now it's still

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.979 
I'm going to get for now it's still
pretty<00:03:42.340> tight<00:03:42.670> but<00:03:43.389> what<00:03:43.510> I'm<00:03:43.569> going<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.870> is

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
pretty tight but what I'm going to do is

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.599 
pretty tight but what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:44.079> going<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.230> rinse<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.889> hopefully<00:03:45.340> that

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
I'm going to rinse it and hopefully that

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.270 
I'm going to rinse it and hopefully that
will<00:03:45.930> loosen<00:03:46.930> some<00:03:47.319> stuff<00:03:47.560> up<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.920> get<00:03:48.100> some

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
will loosen some stuff up and get some

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.420 
will loosen some stuff up and get some
of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> dirt<00:03:48.700> from<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:49.120> between<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:50.200> roots<00:03:50.440> so

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
of the dirt from in between the roots so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520 
of the dirt from in between the roots so
I'm<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.120> take<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.359> in<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.319> bowl

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
I'm just going to take it in this bowl

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.170 
I'm just going to take it in this bowl
of<00:03:53.680> water<00:03:53.799> here<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.549> is<00:03:54.670> also<00:03:54.970> water

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
of water here and this is also water

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.120 
of water here and this is also water
with<00:03:55.569> it's<00:03:55.959> also<00:03:56.109> water<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> solution

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
with it's also water with the solution

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.509 
with it's also water with the solution
in<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:58.359> I'm<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.170> gently<00:04:00.010> go<00:04:00.489> up

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
in it and I'm just going to gently go up

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.860 
in it and I'm just going to gently go up
and<00:04:00.790> down<00:04:00.880> like<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:01.660> knocking

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
and down like this and it's knocking

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.500 
and down like this and it's knocking
loose<00:04:02.319> all<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.370> decomposed<00:04:03.819> potting

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
loose all of the decomposed potting

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.600 
loose all of the decomposed potting
material<00:04:04.599> and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
material and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.450 
material and
the<00:04:05.730> loose<00:04:06.210> chunks<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.690> bark<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.280> see

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
the loose chunks of bark and you can see

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.920 
the loose chunks of bark and you can see
a<00:04:08.640> little<00:04:08.850> bit<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.060> suds<00:04:09.240> forming<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.810> that's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
a little bit of suds forming and that's

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.050 
a little bit of suds forming and that's
just<00:04:10.170> from<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> solution<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.670> now<00:04:11.790> I'm<00:04:11.940> going

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
just from the solution so now I'm going

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.640 
just from the solution so now I'm going
to<00:04:12.120> check<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.480> roots<00:04:12.660> again<00:04:12.900> after<00:04:13.440> I've

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
to check the roots again after I've

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.039 
to check the roots again after I've
washed<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.460> some<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.330> if<00:04:15.480> there's<00:04:15.750> any

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
washed it some and see if there's any

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.430 
washed it some and see if there's any
more<00:04:16.820> dead<00:04:17.820> root<00:04:18.420> material<00:04:18.840> that's<00:04:19.019> shown<00:04:19.260> up

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
more dead root material that's shown up

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.020 
more dead root material that's shown up
so<00:04:19.980> I'm<00:04:20.070> going<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.310> one<00:04:20.459> final<00:04:20.609> check<00:04:21.000> for

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
so I'm going to do one final check for

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.220 
so I'm going to do one final check for
any<00:04:21.740> rotted<00:04:22.740> roots<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.610> can<00:04:26.760> tell<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
any rotted roots and you can tell the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.720 
any rotted roots and you can tell the
rotted<00:04:28.230> ones<00:04:28.440> from<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> healthy<00:04:29.160> ones<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.550> lot

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
rotted ones from the healthy ones a lot

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.280 
rotted ones from the healthy ones a lot
of<00:04:29.820> times<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.090> by<00:04:30.330> feeling<00:04:30.540> them<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:30.960> rotted

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
of times just by feeling them so rotted

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.290 
of times just by feeling them so rotted
ones<00:04:31.440> will<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:31.620> squishy<00:04:32.090> especially<00:04:33.090> after

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
ones will be squishy especially after

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.370 
ones will be squishy especially after
it's<00:04:33.420> been<00:04:33.540> soaking<00:04:33.810> they<00:04:34.080> will<00:04:34.200> have

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
it's been soaking they will have

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.230 
it's been soaking they will have
absorbed<00:04:35.220> some<00:04:35.490> water<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:35.820> they've<00:04:35.910> gotten

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
absorbed some water and they've gotten

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.230 
absorbed some water and they've gotten
mushy<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:38.010> healthy<00:04:38.640> roots<00:04:38.820> will<00:04:39.000> be<00:04:39.030> nice

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
mushy and the healthy roots will be nice

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.330 
mushy and the healthy roots will be nice
and<00:04:39.270> firm<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> other<00:04:40.680> thing<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.980> want<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.220> do

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and firm so the other thing I want to do

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.530 
and firm so the other thing I want to do
is<00:04:41.640> repotting<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.240> really<00:04:42.419> good

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
is repotting is a really good

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.150 
is repotting is a really good
opportunity<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:43.110> trim<00:04:43.590> up<00:04:43.710> your<00:04:43.830> plant<00:04:44.040> and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
opportunity to trim up your plant and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.680 
opportunity to trim up your plant and
make<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.430> look<00:04:44.580> nicer<00:04:44.910> because<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:45.419> not<00:04:45.570> in

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
make it look nicer because it's not in

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.120 
make it look nicer because it's not in
the<00:04:45.750> pot<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.380> lot<00:04:46.500> more<00:04:46.620> flexible<00:04:46.770> to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
the pot so it's a lot more flexible to

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.130 
the pot so it's a lot more flexible to
work<00:04:47.310> with<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> want<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.600> cut<00:04:48.780> off<00:04:48.900> these

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
work with so I want to cut off these

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.960 
work with so I want to cut off these
dead<00:04:49.320> leaf<00:04:49.530> ends<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:50.700> they're

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
dead leaf ends just because they're

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.640 
dead leaf ends just because they're
aesthetically<00:04:52.580> unattractive<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:54.410> also<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
aesthetically unattractive and also the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.800 
aesthetically unattractive and also the
leaf<00:04:55.980> will<00:04:56.130> continue<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.940> degrade<00:04:57.090> in<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.630> lot

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
leaf will continue to degrade in a lot

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.110 
leaf will continue to degrade in a lot
of<00:04:57.840> cases<00:04:58.140> if<00:04:58.590> there's<00:04:58.890> dead<00:04:59.490> material<00:04:59.640> but<00:05:00.060> if

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
of cases if there's dead material but if

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.630 
of cases if there's dead material but if
you<00:05:00.210> cut<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.810> will<00:05:01.380> stay<00:05:01.680> green<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
you cut it it will stay green so this is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.070 
you cut it it will stay green so this is
a<00:05:02.669> good<00:05:02.790> example<00:05:02.910> where<00:05:03.419> this<00:05:03.570> one<00:05:03.720> was<00:05:03.870> cut

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
a good example where this one was cut

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.960 
a good example where this one was cut
you<00:05:05.040> can<00:05:05.160> see<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> rest<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.669> leaf<00:05:05.820> is

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
you can see the rest of the leaf is

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.580 
you can see the rest of the leaf is
still<00:05:06.150> green<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:06.660> still<00:05:06.840> useful<00:05:07.380> for<00:05:07.530> the

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
still green so it's still useful for the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.620 
still green so it's still useful for the
plant<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.820> I'm<00:05:08.970> going<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.150> use<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.300> straight

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
plant so I'm going to use a straight

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.630 
plant so I'm going to use a straight
razor<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:10.590> be<00:05:11.040> careful<00:05:11.190> with<00:05:11.490> them

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
razor for this be careful with them

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.130 
razor for this be careful with them
though<00:05:11.760> because<00:05:12.240> they're<00:05:12.330> extremely<00:05:12.630> sharp<00:05:12.930> I

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
though because they're extremely sharp I

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.750 
though because they're extremely sharp I
try<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.410> not<00:05:13.590> use<00:05:13.800> them<00:05:13.979> more<00:05:14.220> than<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.580> to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
try to not use them more than I have to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.219 
try to not use them more than I have to
because<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.090> tend<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.330> cut<00:05:15.510> myself<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.050> I'm<00:05:16.140> just

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
because I tend to cut myself so I'm just

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.630 
because I tend to cut myself so I'm just
going<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.410> lay<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.740> leaf<00:05:16.919> on<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.190> flat<00:05:17.430> surface

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
going to lay the leaf on a flat surface

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.900 
going to lay the leaf on a flat surface
and<00:05:18.090> then<00:05:18.330> cut<00:05:18.510> across<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:19.460> some<00:05:20.460> people<00:05:20.580> like

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
and then cut across it some people like

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.330 
and then cut across it some people like
to<00:05:20.940> cut<00:05:21.240> at<00:05:21.419> an<00:05:21.570> angle<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.290> that<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.620> looks<00:05:23.190> like

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
to cut at an angle so that it looks like

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.240 
to cut at an angle so that it looks like
the<00:05:24.150> leaf<00:05:24.330> does<00:05:24.600> naturally<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.410> like<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.100> leave

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the leaf does naturally I like to leave

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.490 
the leaf does naturally I like to leave
as<00:05:26.400> much<00:05:26.550> of<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.330> photosynthetic<00:05:27.840> material

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
as much of the photosynthetic material

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.920 
as much of the photosynthetic material

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
ready to go into a show or anything I

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.610 
ready to go into a show or anything I
don't<00:05:32.820> know<00:05:32.940> how<00:05:33.150> much<00:05:33.270> aesthetics<00:05:33.720> matter<00:05:33.960> at

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
don't know how much aesthetics matter at

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.320 
don't know how much aesthetics matter at
this<00:05:34.830> point<00:05:34.950> but<00:05:35.490> it's<00:05:35.700> really<00:05:35.880> up<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.210> you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
this point but it's really up to you

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.750 
this point but it's really up to you
whatever<00:05:36.600> you<00:05:36.810> prefer<00:05:37.280> that<00:05:38.280> little<00:05:38.520> bit<00:05:38.640> of

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
whatever you prefer that little bit of

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.880 
whatever you prefer that little bit of
lost<00:05:39.690> materials<00:05:40.200> not<00:05:40.350> really<00:05:40.590> going<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:40.770> make

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
lost materials not really going to make

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.690 
lost materials not really going to make
a<00:05:40.919> huge<00:05:41.160> difference<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.729> plant<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:43.700> I'm

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
a huge difference to the plant so I'm

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.340 
a huge difference to the plant so I'm
going<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.880> put<00:05:44.970> this<00:05:45.090> one<00:05:45.300> in<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.570> bigger<00:05:45.780> this

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
going to put this one in a bigger this

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.780 
going to put this one in a bigger this
is<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.590> pot<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.890> originally<00:05:47.250> came<00:05:47.400> in<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.729> I'm

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
is the pot it originally came in and I'm

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.650 
is the pot it originally came in and I'm
actually<00:05:47.880> going<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.180> put<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.330> in<00:05:48.450> a<00:05:48.510> much

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
actually going to put it in a much

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.740 
actually going to put it in a much
larger<00:05:48.870> pot<00:05:49.370> that's<00:05:50.370> because<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:51.390> roots<00:05:51.570> are

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
larger pot that's because the roots are

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.409 
larger pot that's because the roots are
extremely<00:05:52.229> bound<00:05:52.440> right<00:05:52.710> now<00:05:52.950> also<00:05:53.820> happy

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
extremely bound right now also happy

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.300 
extremely bound right now also happy
iPad<00:05:54.600> alums<00:05:54.810> tend<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.169> be<00:05:55.320> more<00:05:55.740> water<00:05:56.010> loving

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
iPad alums tend to be more water loving

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.570 
iPad alums tend to be more water loving
than<00:05:56.850> a<00:05:57.330> lot<00:05:58.320> of<00:05:58.410> other<00:05:58.560> orchids<00:05:59.010> so<00:05:59.400> some

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
than a lot of other orchids so some

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.600 
than a lot of other orchids so some
extra<00:05:59.820> potting<00:06:00.090> material<00:06:00.150> is<00:06:00.540> not<00:06:00.690> going<00:06:00.930> to

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
extra potting material is not going to

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.670 
extra potting material is not going to
damage<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.940> too<00:06:03.090> much<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.440> put<00:06:04.560> these<00:06:04.620> a

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
damage it too much I like to put these a

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.080 
damage it too much I like to put these a
little<00:06:04.890> bit<00:06:04.950> lower<00:06:05.190> in<00:06:05.400> their<00:06:05.550> pots<00:06:05.760> because

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
little bit lower in their pots because

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.610 
little bit lower in their pots because
the<00:06:06.210> leaves<00:06:06.390> are<00:06:06.510> so<00:06:06.660> flexible<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.380> then<00:06:07.530> they

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
the leaves are so flexible and then they

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.100 
the leaves are so flexible and then they
can<00:06:07.770> kind<00:06:07.919> of<00:06:08.040> catch<00:06:08.220> over<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.520> edge<00:06:09.020> but<00:06:10.020> you

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
can kind of catch over the edge but you

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.330 
can kind of catch over the edge but you
can<00:06:10.229> also<00:06:10.350> put<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.650> higher<00:06:10.770> in<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:10.979> pot<00:06:11.160> if<00:06:11.250> you

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
can also put it higher in the pot if you

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.770 
can also put it higher in the pot if you
want<00:06:11.520> to<00:06:11.669> so<00:06:11.910> what<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.090> want<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.330> try<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.510> do<00:06:12.660> is

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
want to so what I want to try to do is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.270 
want to so what I want to try to do is
get<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.020> base<00:06:13.200> of<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.410> plants<00:06:13.740> lined<00:06:13.950> up<00:06:14.130> with

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
get the base of the plants lined up with

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.350 
get the base of the plants lined up with
the<00:06:14.370> bottom<00:06:14.490> rim<00:06:14.820> here

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
the bottom rim here

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.379 
the bottom rim here
or<00:06:16.050> with<00:06:16.169> this<00:06:16.259> rim<00:06:16.500> on<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.680> edge<00:06:17.210> I'm<00:06:18.210> going

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
or with this rim on the edge I'm going

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.570 
or with this rim on the edge I'm going
to<00:06:18.449> kind<00:06:18.629> of<00:06:18.659> hold<00:06:18.810> it<00:06:18.930> like<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.259> and<00:06:19.860> now<00:06:20.370> for

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
to kind of hold it like that and now for

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.100 
to kind of hold it like that and now for
this<00:06:20.699> one<00:06:20.849> I'm<00:06:20.939> going<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.120> use<00:06:21.240> this<00:06:21.509> smaller

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
this one I'm going to use this smaller

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.520 
this one I'm going to use this smaller
bark<00:06:22.439> mix<00:06:22.680> over<00:06:23.009> here<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:24.780> finer<00:06:25.020> bark<00:06:25.289> mix

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
bark mix over here the finer bark mix

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.350 
bark mix over here the finer bark mix
because<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.219> roots<00:06:26.400> are<00:06:26.580> smaller<00:06:26.879> than<00:06:27.240> they

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
because the roots are smaller than they

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.149 
because the roots are smaller than they
were<00:06:27.449> on<00:06:27.479> the<00:06:27.659> Bailey<00:06:27.810> enosis<00:06:28.349> and<00:06:28.590> also

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
were on the Bailey enosis and also

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.830 
were on the Bailey enosis and also
because<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.610> smaller<00:06:29.849> bark<00:06:30.120> mix<00:06:30.330> has<00:06:30.599> more

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
because the smaller bark mix has more

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.320 
because the smaller bark mix has more
surface<00:06:31.020> area<00:06:31.379> for<00:06:31.650> water<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.699> adhere<00:06:32.969> to<00:06:33.000> so

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
surface area for water to adhere to so

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.719 
surface area for water to adhere to so
the<00:06:33.449> mix<00:06:33.659> will<00:06:33.840> stay<00:06:34.020> wetter<00:06:34.370> this<00:06:35.370> one<00:06:35.550> is<00:06:35.699> a

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
the mix will stay wetter this one is a

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.040 
the mix will stay wetter this one is a
little<00:06:35.849> bit<00:06:36.060> different<00:06:36.419> than<00:06:36.599> the<00:06:36.689> other<00:06:36.840> one

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
little bit different than the other one

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.110 
little bit different than the other one
it's<00:06:37.289> got<00:06:37.500> charcoal<00:06:37.889> in<00:06:38.069> it<00:06:38.159> and<00:06:38.669> again<00:06:38.969> you

again I'm just going to come down and
I'm<00:06:56.159> going<00:06:56.310> to<00:06:56.340> work<00:06:56.819> the<00:06:57.000> potting<00:06:57.240> mix<00:06:57.419> down

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:57.629 
I'm going to work the potting mix down

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.110 
I'm going to work the potting mix down
in<00:06:57.750> between<00:06:57.960> the<00:06:58.080> roots<00:06:58.580> most<00:06:59.580> orchids<00:06:59.940> bloom

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
in between the roots most orchids bloom

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.149 
in between the roots most orchids bloom
once<00:07:00.330> a<00:07:00.479> year<00:07:00.780> some<00:07:01.080> of<00:07:01.199> them<00:07:01.319> bloom<00:07:01.530> more<00:07:02.009> than

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
once a year some of them bloom more than

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.649 
once a year some of them bloom more than
that<00:07:02.340> but<00:07:02.520> a<00:07:02.550> lot<00:07:02.699> of<00:07:02.729> them<00:07:02.909> bloom<00:07:03.120> just<00:07:03.300> once<00:07:03.509> a

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
that but a lot of them bloom just once a

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:06.619 
that but a lot of them bloom just once a
year<00:07:03.930> and<00:07:04.110> so<00:07:04.289> you<00:07:04.319> might<00:07:04.590> not<00:07:04.740> have<00:07:04.979> a<00:07:05.629> flower

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:06.629 
year and so you might not have a flower

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:08.149 
year and so you might not have a flower
the<00:07:06.900> next<00:07:07.139> year<00:07:07.289> that<00:07:07.319> you<00:07:07.469> expect<00:07:07.800> it<00:07:07.919> but<00:07:08.039> the

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
the next year that you expect it but the

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:10.640 
the next year that you expect it but the
year<00:07:08.310> after<00:07:08.810> that's<00:07:09.810> okay<00:07:10.169> don't<00:07:10.349> be<00:07:10.500> too

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
year after that's okay don't be too

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.809 
year after that's okay don't be too
worried<00:07:10.889> about<00:07:10.949> that<00:07:11.099> it's<00:07:11.400> just<00:07:11.550> the<00:07:11.610> plant

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
worried about that it's just the plant

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.339 
worried about that it's just the plant
adjusting<00:07:12.360> some<00:07:12.539> take<00:07:12.750> a<00:07:12.779> little<00:07:13.020> bit<00:07:13.139> longer

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:13.349 
adjusting some take a little bit longer

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.249 
adjusting some take a little bit longer
than<00:07:13.620> others<00:07:13.889> to<00:07:14.129> adjust<00:07:14.779> but<00:07:15.779> you<00:07:15.870> still<00:07:16.110> want

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
than others to adjust but you still want

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.230 
than others to adjust but you still want
to<00:07:16.289> do<00:07:16.439> it<00:07:16.560> because<00:07:16.710> if<00:07:17.520> you<00:07:17.669> don't<00:07:17.819> repot

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
to do it because if you don't repot

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.670 
to do it because if you don't repot
you're<00:07:18.449> not<00:07:18.599> going<00:07:18.870> to<00:07:18.960> have<00:07:19.050> a<00:07:19.139> healthy<00:07:19.440> plant

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
you're not going to have a healthy plant

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.469 
you're not going to have a healthy plant
so<00:07:20.069> in<00:07:20.370> the<00:07:20.460> case<00:07:20.639> of<00:07:20.669> something<00:07:21.029> that<00:07:21.270> if<00:07:21.389> you

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 
so in the case of something that if you

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:23.480 
so in the case of something that if you
repotted<00:07:21.990> it<00:07:22.139> and<00:07:22.440> then<00:07:22.949> a<00:07:22.979> year<00:07:23.099> later<00:07:23.159> it

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
repotted it and then a year later it

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.149 
repotted it and then a year later it
doesn't<00:07:23.639> bloom<00:07:24.020> don't<00:07:25.020> don't<00:07:25.409> repot<00:07:25.830> it<00:07:25.860> again

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159 
doesn't bloom don't don't repot it again

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.709 
doesn't bloom don't don't repot it again
just<00:07:26.340> wait<00:07:26.610> and<00:07:26.789> then<00:07:27.150> you'll<00:07:27.300> get<00:07:27.389> a<00:07:27.449> bloom

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
just wait and then you'll get a bloom

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.709 
just wait and then you'll get a bloom
the<00:07:28.199> following<00:07:28.650> year<00:07:29.090> all<00:07:30.090> right<00:07:30.270> so<00:07:30.539> then<00:07:30.690> you

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:30.719 
the following year all right so then you

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:32.300 
the following year all right so then you
want<00:07:30.930> to<00:07:30.990> put<00:07:31.110> your<00:07:31.199> tag<00:07:31.440> if<00:07:31.800> you<00:07:31.919> have<00:07:32.099> one

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
want to put your tag if you have one

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.709 
want to put your tag if you have one
