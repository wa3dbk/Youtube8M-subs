by<00:00:06.480> exam<00:00:07.080> feel<00:00:07.350> calm<00:00:07.890> no<00:00:08.370> more<00:00:08.639> fear<00:00:08.940> from<00:00:09.179> exam

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
by exam feel calm no more fear from exam

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
by exam feel calm no more fear from exam
so<00:00:10.740> let<00:00:10.889> us<00:00:11.070> now<00:00:11.250> talk<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.910> information

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
so let us now talk about information

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.410 
so let us now talk about information
detection<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.559> impulse<00:00:14.429> conduction<00:00:14.790> by

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
detection and impulse conduction by

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.730 
detection and impulse conduction by
nerve<00:00:15.690> cells<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:18.289> how<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
nerve cells how actually this how the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
nerve cells how actually this how the
nerve<00:00:19.980> cells<00:00:20.369> actually<00:00:20.609> detect<00:00:21.230> some

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
nerve cells actually detect some

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220 
nerve cells actually detect some
external<00:00:22.800> information<00:00:23.510> now<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
external information now that we have

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
external information now that we have
already<00:00:25.769> understood<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.670> structure<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
already understood the structure of a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.870 
already understood the structure of a
neuron<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.779> am<00:00:27.869> sure<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.039> guessed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
neuron I am sure that you have guessed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.179 
neuron I am sure that you have guessed
that<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.810> transfer<00:00:31.289> actually<00:00:31.679> takes

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that how this transfer actually takes

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.190 
that how this transfer actually takes
place<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.910> still<00:00:33.090> let<00:00:33.360> us<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> look<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
place but still let us have a look at it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.000 
place but still let us have a look at it
in<00:00:34.320> detail<00:00:35.510> now<00:00:36.510> specialized<00:00:37.110> tips<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.770> some

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
in detail now specialized tips of some

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.540 
in detail now specialized tips of some
nerve<00:00:38.250> cells<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> sensory<00:00:39.510> organs<00:00:40.550> what

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
nerve cells in the sensory organs what

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
nerve cells in the sensory organs what
will<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.750> actually<00:00:42.989> sends<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
will they do they actually sends the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
will they do they actually sends the
external<00:00:45.000> stimuli<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.780> example<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
external stimuli for example there is a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.690 
external stimuli for example there is a
tiger

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
tiger

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
tiger
so<00:00:48.329> who<00:00:48.719> sees<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> tiger<00:00:49.860> our

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so who sees that there is a tiger our

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
so who sees that there is a tiger our
eyes<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.969> eyes<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.420> nothing<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> sensory

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
eyes so eyes are nothing but the sensory

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
eyes so eyes are nothing but the sensory
organs<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> cells<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.690> sensory

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
organs so the cells of these sensory

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.069 
organs so the cells of these sensory
organs<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.920> specialized<00:00:56.550> tips<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
organs have specialized tips because of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.630 
organs have specialized tips because of
which<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.559> able<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> sense<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
which they are able to sense the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.799 
which they are able to sense the
external<00:01:00.239> stimuli<00:01:01.309> right<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.329> enters

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
external stimuli right and how it enters

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
external stimuli right and how it enters
the<00:01:04.110> neurons<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.830> enters<00:01:05.640> through<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the neurons it enters through the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
the neurons it enters through the
dendrites<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> dendrites<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.490> actually

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
dendrites so the dendrites will actually

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.020 
dendrites so the dendrites will actually
bring<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> information<00:01:09.869> from<00:01:10.470> outside<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.909> we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
bring the information from outside so we

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
bring the information from outside so we
can<00:01:12.210> say<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.080> information<00:01:13.409> from

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can say that the information from

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.130 
can say that the information from
outside<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.790> received<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> specialised

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
outside are received by the specialised

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.859 
outside are received by the specialised
tips<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.009> nerve<00:01:17.250> cells<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.869> these

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
tips of some nerve cells and these

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
tips of some nerve cells and these
receptors<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.799> present<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> sense

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
receptors are present in the sense

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.679 
receptors are present in the sense
organs<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.930> sensory<00:01:22.290> organs<00:01:23.420> now<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
organs the sensory organs now as I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.789 
organs the sensory organs now as I
mentioned<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> previous<00:01:25.380> slides

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
mentioned in the previous slides

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
mentioned in the previous slides
dendrites<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:27.299> receive<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> information

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
dendrites will receive the information

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
dendrites will receive the information
so<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.100> bring<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> information<00:01:29.820> inside

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
so it will bring the information inside

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.550 
so it will bring the information inside
the<00:01:31.860> neuron<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.850> inside<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> cell<00:01:33.810> body<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the neuron or inside the cell body of a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
the neuron or inside the cell body of a
neuron<00:01:35.000> now<00:01:36.000> once<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.720> brings<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
neuron now once it brings the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.940 
neuron now once it brings the
information<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:38.250> chemical<00:01:38.850> reaction<00:01:39.210> starts

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
information a chemical reaction starts

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
information a chemical reaction starts
so<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> means<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.520> neurons

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so that means this is how the neurons

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
so that means this is how the neurons
are<00:01:45.240> connected<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.130> are

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
are connected so you see here these are

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.120 
are connected so you see here these are
the<00:01:47.759> dendrites<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:49.200> neuron<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:49.890> are

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the dendrites of a neuron and these are

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
the dendrites of a neuron and these are
the<00:01:50.280> axon<00:01:50.850> endings<00:01:51.299> again<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.170> these<00:01:52.500> are

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the axon endings again these these are

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.590 
the axon endings again these these are
dendrites<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> second<00:01:54.030> neurons<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
dendrites of the second neurons and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
dendrites of the second neurons and
these<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> axon<00:01:55.649> endings<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.549> are

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
these are the axon endings these are

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
these are the axon endings these are
dendrites<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> third<00:01:57.899> neuron<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
dendrites of the third neuron so that is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.100 
dendrites of the third neuron so that is
how<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> neurons<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.640> connected<00:01:59.899> right<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
how the neurons are connected right so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.490 
how the neurons are connected right so
in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.560> end<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:02.070> bring<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.490> information

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
in the end I will bring the information

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
in the end I will bring the information
into<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> site<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> cell<00:02:06.210> body

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
into the site on that is the cell body

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.050 
into the site on that is the cell body
so<00:02:06.990> from<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.799> external<00:02:08.160> information<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so from a some external information it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
so from a some external information it
will<00:02:09.209> bring<00:02:09.479> inside<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.349> cell<00:02:11.039> body<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:12.330> what

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
will bring inside the cell body now what

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.369 
will bring inside the cell body now what
as<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.470> information<00:02:14.069> comes<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:15.379> chemical

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
as the information comes in a chemical

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.559 
as the information comes in a chemical
reaction<00:02:16.409> will<00:02:17.190> start<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.209> chemical

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
reaction will start and this chemical

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.990 
reaction will start and this chemical
reaction<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:19.530> produce<00:02:19.739> an<00:02:20.190> electric

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
reaction will produce an electric

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.860 
reaction will produce an electric
impulse<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.769> chemical<00:02:23.459> reaction<00:02:24.000> starts

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
impulse so a chemical reaction starts

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.420 
impulse so a chemical reaction starts
which<00:02:25.409> will<00:02:25.650> produce<00:02:25.890> an<00:02:26.599> electrical<00:02:27.599> impulse

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
which will produce an electrical impulse

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.550 
which will produce an electrical impulse
so<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:30.090> an<00:02:30.299> electrical<00:02:30.840> impulse<00:02:31.019> in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so now we have an electrical impulse in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.729 
so now we have an electrical impulse in
the<00:02:31.709> cell<00:02:32.280> body<00:02:32.519> order<00:02:33.060> sytem<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:34.319> from<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
the cell body order sytem now from the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.949 
the cell body order sytem now from the
site<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.190> where<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.730> go<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:36.420> site<00:02:36.750> on

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
site on where will it go from site on

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.199 
site on where will it go from site on
this<00:02:37.200> electric<00:02:37.709> impulse<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.549> go<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.970> ad

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
this electric impulse will go to the ad

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.390 
this electric impulse will go to the ad
zone<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.870> means<00:02:40.200> from<00:02:40.349> site<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.190> will

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
zone so that means from site on it will

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
zone so that means from site on it will
go<00:02:41.700> towards<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.510> axon<00:02:44.000> right<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.660> axon

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
go towards the axon right so from axon

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.300 
go towards the axon right so from axon
it<00:02:46.470> will<00:02:46.680> go<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.280> ads<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:48.060> endings<00:02:48.629> that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it will go to them ads on endings that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
it will go to them ads on endings that
means<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.670> information<00:02:51.299> will<00:02:51.510> come<00:02:51.629> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
means this information will come to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
means this information will come to
these<00:02:52.680> points<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.370> axon<00:02:53.790> endings<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:56.359> from

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
these points the axon endings and from

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.920 
these points the axon endings and from
ads<00:02:57.599> on<00:02:57.870> endings<00:02:58.549> work<00:02:59.549> at<00:02:59.819> axon<00:03:00.329> endings<00:03:00.720> what

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
ads on endings work at axon endings what

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.990 
ads on endings work at axon endings what
will<00:03:01.140> happen<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.950> electrical<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.819> now

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
will happen this electrical so right now

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.610 
will happen this electrical so right now
whatever<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.569> traveling<00:03:04.109> that<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.470> nothing

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
whatever is traveling that is nothing

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.030 
whatever is traveling that is nothing
but<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.549> electric<00:03:06.120> impulse<00:03:06.739> rates<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.920> this

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
but the electric impulse rates of this

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
but the electric impulse rates of this
electric<00:03:08.519> impulse<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:09.030> actually<00:03:09.450> traveling

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
electric impulse is actually traveling

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.830 
electric impulse is actually traveling
from<00:03:10.200> xyron<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.980> ad<00:03:11.129> swarm<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.000> axon<00:03:12.390> endings

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
from xyron to ad swarm to axon endings

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.770 
from xyron to ad swarm to axon endings
now<00:03:13.049> at<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.500> axon<00:03:13.890> endings<00:03:14.430> these<00:03:15.000> electrical

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
now at the axon endings these electrical

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.120 
now at the axon endings these electrical
impulse<00:03:16.349> will<00:03:17.130> again<00:03:17.639> get<00:03:17.970> converted<00:03:18.599> into

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
impulse will again get converted into

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.599 
impulse will again get converted into
chemicals<00:03:21.230> now<00:03:22.230> how<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.799> conversion<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
chemicals now how this conversion of

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.550 
chemicals now how this conversion of
chemicals<00:03:24.239> into<00:03:24.599> electrical<00:03:25.079> impulse

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
chemicals into electrical impulse

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.710 
chemicals into electrical impulse
happens<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.489> we<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:26.880> study<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.299> our<00:03:27.389> higher

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
happens that we will study in our higher

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.869 
happens that we will study in our higher
classes<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.440> because<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:28.950> involves<00:03:29.519> little

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
classes but because that involves little

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.909 
classes but because that involves little
complex<00:03:30.629> equations<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.379> chemical<00:03:31.769> reactions

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
complex equations and chemical reactions

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.740 
complex equations and chemical reactions
so<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.609> will<00:03:32.760> speak<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.629> our

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so we will speak about that in our

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.080 
so we will speak about that in our
higher<00:03:34.410> classes<00:03:34.919> so<00:03:35.340> for<00:03:35.489> now<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.700> should

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
higher classes so for now you should

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.960 
higher classes so for now you should
just<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.069> advance<00:03:38.730> on

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
just know this that the advance on

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
just know this that the advance on
endings<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.510> electric<00:03:39.840> impulse<00:03:40.230> will<00:03:40.410> again

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
endings the electric impulse will again

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.129 
endings the electric impulse will again
get<00:03:40.859> converted<00:03:41.340> into<00:03:42.049> chemicals<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.430> then

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
get converted into chemicals and then

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.670 
get converted into chemicals and then
these<00:03:46.139> chemicals<00:03:46.889> will<00:03:47.519> actually<00:03:48.090> cross<00:03:48.419> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
these chemicals will actually cross the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.460 
these chemicals will actually cross the
synapse<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:50.010> means<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.150> gap<00:03:51.449> so<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.109> see

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
synapse that means the gap so you see

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.220 
synapse that means the gap so you see
here<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.919> a<00:03:53.069> gap<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.879> gap<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.629> nothing<00:03:55.019> but

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
here is a gap so that gap is nothing but

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.539 
here is a gap so that gap is nothing but
the<00:03:55.739> synapse<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:58.319> chemicals<00:03:58.949> will<00:03:59.280> then

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
the synapse so the chemicals will then

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.990 
the synapse so the chemicals will then
cross<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.720> synapse<00:04:01.169> so<00:04:01.500> where<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.639> will<00:04:02.849> go

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
cross the synapse so where it will go

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.729 
cross the synapse so where it will go
after<00:04:03.150> crossing<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.870> synapse<00:04:04.199> it<00:04:04.349> will<00:04:04.530> reach

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
after crossing the synapse it will reach

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.849 
after crossing the synapse it will reach
the<00:04:04.769> dendrite<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.239> next<00:04:06.569> neuron<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.560> it

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
the dendrite of the next neuron so it

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.300 
the dendrite of the next neuron so it
reaches<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.730> other<00:04:09.599> neuron<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:11.069> how

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
reaches the other neuron so that is how

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.759 
reaches the other neuron so that is how
the<00:04:11.370> information<00:04:11.970> will<00:04:12.660> get<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.379> when<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
the information will get so when it

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.349 
the information will get so when it
reaches<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.310> other<00:04:14.340> neuron<00:04:14.940> what<00:04:15.180> will

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
reaches the other neuron what will

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.599 
reaches the other neuron what will
happen<00:04:15.690> again<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.500> chemical<00:04:16.919> reaction<00:04:17.430> will

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
happen again the chemical reaction will

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.939 
happen again the chemical reaction will
start<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.359> dendrite<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:19.560> electric

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
start in that dendrite so electric

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.680 
start in that dendrite so electric
impulse<00:04:20.310> will<00:04:20.459> be<00:04:20.489> produced<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.209> electric

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
impulse will be produced and electric

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.230 
impulse will be produced and electric
impulse<00:04:22.079> will<00:04:22.289> move<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.950> side<00:04:23.490> down<00:04:23.760> from

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
impulse will move to the side down from

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.300 
impulse will move to the side down from
it<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:24.780> go<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.960> ads<00:04:25.199> on<00:04:25.560> from<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.039> it<00:04:26.190> will

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it will go to ads on from there it will

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.909 
it will go to ads on from there it will
go<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> ads<00:04:26.789> on<00:04:27.030> endings<00:04:27.539> they<00:04:28.080> are<00:04:28.169> again<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
go to ads on endings they are again the

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.529 
go to ads on endings they are again the
chemicals<00:04:29.460> will<00:04:29.669> get<00:04:29.819> converted<00:04:30.210> the

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
chemicals will get converted the

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.390 
chemicals will get converted the
electrical<00:04:31.139> impulse<00:04:31.500> will<00:04:31.650> get<00:04:31.800> converted<00:04:32.160> to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
electrical impulse will get converted to

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.189 
electrical impulse will get converted to
chemicals<00:04:32.910> they<00:04:33.060> will<00:04:33.210> cross<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.690> synapse

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
chemicals they will cross the synapse

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.800 
chemicals they will cross the synapse
and<00:04:34.410> reach<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.949> third<00:04:35.550> neuron<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:36.630> is

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and reach the third neuron so that is

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.409 
and reach the third neuron so that is
how<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.650> information<00:04:38.460> or<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.759> impulse

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
how the information or the impulse

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.320 
how the information or the impulse
conduction<00:04:39.750> happens<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.949> case<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.330> nerve

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
conduction happens in case of nerve

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.029 
conduction happens in case of nerve
cells<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.560> this<00:04:43.740> process<00:04:44.190> continues<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.710> here

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
cells so this process continues so here

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.159 
cells so this process continues so here
in<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:47.370> picture<00:04:47.759> what<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.030> tried<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.660> show<00:04:48.870> was

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
in this picture what I tried to show was

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.710 
in this picture what I tried to show was
these<00:04:49.830> are<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.789> chemicals<00:04:51.360> which<00:04:51.569> are

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
these are the chemicals which are

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.510 
these are the chemicals which are
actually<00:04:52.110> crossing<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.680> synapse<00:04:53.039> so<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.370> is

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
actually crossing the synapse so this is

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.550 
actually crossing the synapse so this is
the<00:04:53.699> synapse<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.699> this<00:04:56.699> is<00:04:57.229> axon<00:04:58.229> endings<00:04:58.860> and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
the synapse so this is axon endings and

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.510 
the synapse so this is axon endings and
here<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.280> dendrite<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:05.250> is

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
here this is the dendrite and this is

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.710 
here this is the dendrite and this is
the<00:05:05.820> synapse<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.729> what<00:05:08.729> are<00:05:08.910> these<00:05:09.090> small

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
the synapse and what are these small

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.930 
the synapse and what are these small
molecules<00:05:10.020> which<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.710> see<00:05:10.919> here<00:05:11.160> these<00:05:11.699> are

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
molecules which you see here these are

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.790 
molecules which you see here these are
nothing<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.800> neurotransmitters

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
nothing but the neurotransmitters

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.499 
nothing but the neurotransmitters
because<00:05:14.130> they<00:05:14.310> are<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.849> ones<00:05:15.060> who<00:05:15.330> are

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
because they are the ones who are

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.689 
because they are the ones who are
actually<00:05:15.659> transmitting<00:05:16.590> information<00:05:17.009> and

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
actually transmitting information and

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.120 
actually transmitting information and
here<00:05:18.180> in<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.449> dendrites<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.229> have<00:05:19.470> since

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
here in the dendrites you have since

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.339 
here in the dendrites you have since
dendrites<00:05:20.639> receive<00:05:21.020> information<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:22.199> they

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
dendrites receive information so they

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.040 
dendrites receive information so they
have<00:05:22.590> receptors<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:24.240> see<00:05:24.419> these<00:05:24.720> structures

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
have receptors so see these structures

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.779 
have receptors so see these structures
they<00:05:25.440> are<00:05:25.560> nothing<00:05:25.860> but<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.069> receptors

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
they are nothing but the receptors

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.730 
they are nothing but the receptors
present<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.330> dendrites<00:05:27.810> are<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.199> receiving

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
present on dendrites are the receiving

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.499 
present on dendrites are the receiving
ends<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.940> dendrite

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
ends of the dendrite

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.390 
ends of the dendrite
so<00:05:30.780> these<00:05:30.900> receiving<00:05:31.530> ends<00:05:31.830> will<00:05:32.009> actually

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
so these receiving ends will actually

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.820 
so these receiving ends will actually
receive<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:33.590> neurotransmitters<00:05:35.659> clear<00:05:38.419> ok

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
receive the neurotransmitters clear ok

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.950 
receive the neurotransmitters clear ok
so<00:05:40.830> therefore<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.460> can<00:05:41.639> say<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:41.960> conduction

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
so therefore we can say that conduction

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.279 
so therefore we can say that conduction
of<00:05:43.080> impulses<00:05:43.949> is<00:05:44.130> an<00:05:44.340> electrochemical

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
of impulses is an electrochemical

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.230 
of impulses is an electrochemical
phenomenon<00:05:46.289> why<00:05:46.770> is<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.460> an<00:05:47.669> electrochemical

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
phenomenon why is it an electrochemical

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.070 
phenomenon why is it an electrochemical
phenomenon<00:05:49.460> electrochemical<00:05:50.539> because<00:05:51.539> when

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
phenomenon electrochemical because when

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.050 
phenomenon electrochemical because when
we<00:05:52.229> talk<00:05:52.440> about<00:05:52.469> electro<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:53.520> are<00:05:53.610> talking

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
we talk about electro we are talking

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.810 
we talk about electro we are talking
about<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.900> electrical<00:05:55.620> impulses<00:05:56.430> because

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
about the electrical impulses because

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.790 
about the electrical impulses because
the<00:05:57.000> transfer<00:05:57.599> happens<00:05:58.080> in<00:05:58.229> the<00:05:58.349> form<00:05:58.620> of

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
the transfer happens in the form of

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.149 
the transfer happens in the form of
electric<00:05:59.430> impulses<00:06:00.090> why<00:06:00.690> chemical<00:06:01.320> because

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
electric impulses why chemical because

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.700 
electric impulses why chemical because
these<00:06:02.580> electric<00:06:03.150> chemical<00:06:03.500> impulses<00:06:04.500> are

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
these electric chemical impulses are

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.100 
these electric chemical impulses are
generated<00:06:04.770> as<00:06:05.639> a<00:06:05.969> result<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.659> chemical

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
generated as a result of chemical

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.770 
generated as a result of chemical
reactions<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:08.250> again<00:06:08.880> when<00:06:09.090> these<00:06:09.240> electric

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
reactions and again when these electric

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.540 
reactions and again when these electric
impulses<00:06:10.320> have<00:06:10.469> to<00:06:10.590> cross<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.099> synapse

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
impulses have to cross the synapse

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.640 
impulses have to cross the synapse
between<00:06:11.789> two<00:06:12.180> neurons<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:13.169> they<00:06:13.620> are

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
between two neurons the they are

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.439 
between two neurons the they are
converted<00:06:14.340> into<00:06:14.490> chemicals<00:06:15.060> and<00:06:15.300> those

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
converted into chemicals and those

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.839 
converted into chemicals and those
chemicals<00:06:16.020> transfer<00:06:16.530> them<00:06:16.710> synapse<00:06:17.370> so<00:06:17.729> if

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
chemicals transfer them synapse so if

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.760 
chemicals transfer them synapse so if
you<00:06:17.969> see<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.270> entire<00:06:18.599> process<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.259> involves

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
you see that entire process it involves

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.620 
you see that entire process it involves
either<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.250> chemicals<00:06:20.759> or<00:06:20.969> the<00:06:21.270> electric

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
either the chemicals or the electric

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.430 
either the chemicals or the electric
impulses<00:06:22.199> so<00:06:22.620> this<00:06:22.860> phenomenon<00:06:23.490> is<00:06:23.639> a

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
impulses so this phenomenon is a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.730 
impulses so this phenomenon is a
electrochemical<00:06:25.440> phenomenon<00:06:30.349> so<00:06:31.349> here<00:06:31.590> you

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
electrochemical phenomenon so here you

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.640 
electrochemical phenomenon so here you
can<00:06:31.949> see<00:06:32.219> the<00:06:32.789> transfer<00:06:33.719> how<00:06:33.900> it<00:06:34.080> takes<00:06:34.289> place

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
can see the transfer how it takes place

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.480 
can see the transfer how it takes place
so<00:06:35.310> this<00:06:35.610> is<00:06:35.789> how<00:06:36.000> conduction<00:06:36.659> of<00:06:36.719> impulses

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
so this is how conduction of impulses

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.020 
so this is how conduction of impulses
