00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
at the Superman robot so let's get a

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.240 
at the Superman robot so let's get a
good<00:01:50.650> look<00:01:50.710> at<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.100> figure<00:01:51.400> here<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.860> like

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
good look at the figure here I do like

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.429 
good look at the figure here I do like
the<00:01:57.430> fact<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.330> like<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.869> sculpt<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.409> the

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
the fact that I like the sculpt on the

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.039 
the fact that I like the sculpt on the
head<00:01:59.770> because<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.369> very<00:02:01.119> reminiscent<00:02:01.689> of

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
head because it's very reminiscent of

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.330 
head because it's very reminiscent of
the<00:02:02.229> old<00:02:02.670> vintage<00:02:03.670> Superman<00:02:04.390> comics<00:02:05.340> he

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
the old vintage Superman comics he

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.650 
the old vintage Superman comics he
doesn't<00:02:06.640> really<00:02:06.729> look<00:02:06.970> like<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
doesn't really look like this now so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.720 
doesn't really look like this now so
it's<00:02:10.660> nice<00:02:11.019> for<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.980> know<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.340> gives<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.640> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it's nice for you know it gives you a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.069 
it's nice for you know it gives you a
good<00:02:12.850> classic<00:02:13.360> feel<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.840> Superman<00:02:14.320> here<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:16.390> lot

elbows and hands really really nice I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.700 
elbows and hands really really nice I
don't<00:02:51.240> think<00:02:51.690> there<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.050> need<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.530> make

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
don't think there was a need to make

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.920 
don't think there was a need to make
this<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> Superman<00:02:53.760> robot<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.330> why<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.660> it

circuitry<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.910> don't<00:03:12.480> know<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:13.440> would<00:03:13.560> have

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
circuitry I don't know it would have

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.930 
circuitry I don't know it would have
been<00:03:13.709> nice<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.100> they<00:03:14.220> had<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.520> kept<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.880> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
been nice if they had just kept this a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.800 
been nice if they had just kept this a
symbol<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.910> didn't<00:03:17.910> bother<00:03:18.030> making<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.630> as

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
symbol and didn't bother making it as

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.440 
symbol and didn't bother making it as
Superman<00:03:19.290> or<00:03:20.220> didn't<00:03:20.790> bother<00:03:20.940> making<00:03:21.150> a

Superman or didn't bother making a
Superman<00:03:21.840> robot<00:03:22.200> at<00:03:22.350> least<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.670> only<00:03:23.820> problem

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
Superman robot at least the only problem

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.310 
Superman robot at least the only problem
with<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.750> once<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.680> opened<00:03:26.150> this

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
with it is once you get it opened this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.830 
with it is once you get it opened this
symbol<00:03:28.320> doesn't<00:03:28.500> sit<00:03:28.860> all<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.160> well<00:03:29.840> but

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
symbol doesn't sit all that well but

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.320 
symbol doesn't sit all that well but
here<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:31.830> have<00:03:31.890> Superman<00:03:32.250> nice<00:03:32.670> symbol<00:03:33.240> on

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
here you have Superman nice symbol on

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.650 
here you have Superman nice symbol on
the<00:03:33.450> back<00:03:33.630> here<00:03:34.790> because<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.940> articulation

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the back here because the articulation

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.180 
the back here because the articulation
or<00:03:36.780> way<00:03:36.870> they've<00:03:37.080> applied<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.650> cape<00:03:37.890> here

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
or way they've applied the cape here

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.850 
or way they've applied the cape here
this<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.180> separate<00:03:39.570> piece<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.680> can

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
this is a separate piece so that you can

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.550 
this is a separate piece so that you can
notice<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.520> separate<00:03:42.090> from<00:03:42.560> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
notice that this is separate from the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 
notice that this is separate from the
the<00:03:44.190> sculpt<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.790> cape<00:03:45.000> at<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> top<00:03:45.450> here

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the sculpt of the cape at the top here

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.320 
the sculpt of the cape at the top here
and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.830> course<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.550> see<00:03:47.760> his<00:03:48.030> head

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and then of course you can see his head

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.020 
and then of course you can see his head
is<00:03:48.600> different<00:03:49.050> from<00:03:49.830> his<00:03:50.040> neck<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:50.760> this

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
is different from his neck here so this

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.770 
is different from his neck here so this
looks<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.480> separate<00:03:51.870> piece<00:03:53.600> overall<00:03:54.600> not

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
looks like a separate piece overall not

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.050 
looks like a separate piece overall not
a<00:03:54.810> bad<00:03:54.870> figure<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.550> course<00:03:56.790> he<00:03:56.880> comes

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
a bad figure and then of course he comes

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.160 
a bad figure and then of course he comes
with<00:03:57.269> his<00:03:57.800> stupid<00:03:58.800> monkey<00:03:59.630> not<00:04:00.630> bad<00:04:00.840> he's<00:04:01.050> got

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
with his stupid monkey not bad he's got

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.990 
with his stupid monkey not bad he's got
articulation<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.950> arms<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.610> then<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
articulation in the arms and then in the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.870 
articulation in the arms and then in the
legs<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.540> his<00:04:03.780> head<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.140> well<00:04:04.370> not<00:04:05.370> much

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
legs in his head as well not much

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.509 
legs in his head as well not much
and<00:04:05.970> he's<00:04:06.540> looking<00:04:06.980> he<00:04:07.980> doesn't<00:04:08.250> seem<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.489> want

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
and he's looking he doesn't seem to want

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.920 
and he's looking he doesn't seem to want
to<00:04:08.670> look<00:04:08.850> down<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.239> only<00:04:09.330> looks<00:04:09.600> up

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.979 

god<00:04:12.930> bless<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> stupid<00:04:13.709> monkey<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.720> of

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
god bless the stupid monkey and of

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.659 
god bless the stupid monkey and of
course<00:04:16.440> he<00:04:16.650> also<00:04:16.680> comes<00:04:17.130> with<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.370> base<00:04:19.669> there

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
course he also comes with a base there

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.280 
course he also comes with a base there
is<00:04:20.880> also<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.180> little<00:04:21.419> peg<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:21.989> put<00:04:22.169> in

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
is also a little peg that you can put in

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.330 
is also a little peg that you can put in
here<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.680> Superman<00:04:22.950> will<00:04:23.190> stand<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:25.340> very

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
here so Superman will stand on it very

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.610 
here so Superman will stand on it very
nice<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:27.169> he<00:04:28.169> also<00:04:28.320> comes<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.830> not<00:04:29.760> one<00:04:30.620> but

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
nice and he also comes with not one but

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.710 
nice and he also comes with not one but
also<00:04:31.830> two<00:04:32.840> interchangeable<00:04:33.840> hands<00:04:35.720> overall

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
also two interchangeable hands overall

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.300 
also two interchangeable hands overall
it's<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> nice<00:04:37.020> figure<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.560> would<00:04:37.710> say<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.130> only

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
it's a nice figure I would say the only

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.659 
it's a nice figure I would say the only
drawback<00:04:38.669> is<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.210> with<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.540> symbol<00:04:40.669> would

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
drawback is is with the symbol would

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.980 
drawback is is with the symbol would
have<00:04:41.790> been<00:04:41.880> nice<00:04:42.030> if<00:04:42.060> they<00:04:42.270> had<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:42.540> kept<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
have been nice if they had just kept it

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.390 
have been nice if they had just kept it
the<00:04:43.080> way<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.440> without<00:04:43.950> making<00:04:44.280> this

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the way it is without making this

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.750 
the way it is without making this
robotic<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:45.830> there<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.919> have<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.190> toy<00:04:47.550> spot-on

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
robotic but there you have a toy spot-on

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.980 
robotic but there you have a toy spot-on
