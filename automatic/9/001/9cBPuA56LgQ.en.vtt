why I was playing with a party of six is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
why I was playing with a party of six is
because<00:00:30.840> when<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.500> playing<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> xbox<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
because when I was playing the xbox the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
because when I was playing the xbox the
other<00:00:32.430> day<00:00:32.610> actually<00:00:32.850> nudged<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.600> disc<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
