there<00:00:11.130> are<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.370> whole<00:00:11.820> lot<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.230> different<00:00:13.230> ways

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
there are a whole lot of different ways

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.640 
there are a whole lot of different ways
of<00:00:13.860> trying<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.549> improve<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.750> blood<00:00:16.020> sugar<00:00:16.410> Bob

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
of trying to improve the blood sugar Bob

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.140 
of trying to improve the blood sugar Bob
the<00:00:17.460> initial<00:00:18.180> class<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.840> medications<00:00:19.619> called

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
the initial class of medications called

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
the initial class of medications called
sulfonylureas<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.300> there's<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.630> six<00:00:22.560> or

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
sulfonylureas and there's like six or

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.630 
sulfonylureas and there's like six or
eight<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> those<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.400> were<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> first

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
eight of those of it they were the first

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.960 
eight of those of it they were the first
ones<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> came<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.050> 50s<00:00:25.500> ad

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
ones that came out back in the 50s ad

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
ones that came out back in the 50s ad
they<00:00:26.970> basically<00:00:27.359> work<00:00:28.080> predominantly<00:00:28.680> by

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
they basically work predominantly by

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
they basically work predominantly by
just<00:00:29.369> goosing<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> pancreas<00:00:30.630> stimulate

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just goosing the pancreas stimulate

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
just goosing the pancreas stimulate
increases<00:00:31.890> where<00:00:32.099> insulin<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.820> where<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
increases where insulin that's where the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
increases where insulin that's where the
insulin<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.750> produced<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> islets<00:00:35.309> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
insulin is produced and islets of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
insulin is produced and islets of
langerhans<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.020> remember

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
langerhans that's the one I remember

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
langerhans that's the one I remember
that<00:00:37.500> medical<00:00:38.010> school<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> wanted<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> put

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that medical school I just wanted to put

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
that medical school I just wanted to put
that<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.290> where'd<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.320> park<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.710> car

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that out there where'd you park your car

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
that out there where'd you park your car
Bob<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.340> forget<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.210> remember<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.690> medical

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
Bob I forget but i remember in medical

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
Bob I forget but i remember in medical
school<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.960> he<00:00:46.140> gooses<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.980> islets<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
school so so he gooses the islets of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.889 
school so so he gooses the islets of
langerhans<00:00:49.079> puts<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.649> insulin<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.610> was

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
langerhans puts out insulin that was

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
langerhans puts out insulin that was
sulfonylurea<00:00:51.899> yeah<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
sulfonylurea yeah and then there's a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
sulfonylurea yeah and then there's a
newer<00:00:54.390> class<00:00:54.780> called<00:00:55.170> Lytton<00:00:55.620> ides<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.100> do

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
newer class called Lytton ides that do

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.959 
newer class called Lytton ides that do
very<00:00:56.550> similar<00:00:56.850> things<00:00:57.949> but<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.370> problem<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
very similar things but the problem is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
very similar things but the problem is
they<00:01:00.120> tend<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> burn<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> pancreas<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
they tend to burn out the pancreas you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
they tend to burn out the pancreas you
it's<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.520> whipping<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> tired<00:01:03.210> horse

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's like you're whipping a tired horse

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
it's like you're whipping a tired horse
so<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> don't<00:01:04.530> even<00:01:04.890> though<00:01:05.010> they're<00:01:05.220> very

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so we don't even though they're very

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
so we don't even though they're very
cheap<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.290> much

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
cheap we don't use them very much

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.050 
cheap we don't use them very much
anymore<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:08.520> thing<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.909> can

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
anymore the other thing is they can

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.120 
anymore the other thing is they can
cause<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> sugar<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> drop<00:01:09.990> too<00:01:10.290> low<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
cause the sugar to drop too low and that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.359 
cause the sugar to drop too low and that
can<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.670> serious<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> second<00:01:13.680> class<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
can be very serious the second class is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.289 
can be very serious the second class is
a<00:01:15.000> medicine<00:01:15.540> called<00:01:15.930> metformin<00:01:16.710> or

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
a medicine called metformin or

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
a medicine called metformin or
glucophage<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> brand<00:01:18.960> name<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.950> been

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
glucophage was the brand name it's been

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.020 
glucophage was the brand name it's been
out<00:01:20.490> since<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.560> 1970s<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:23.040> either<00:01:23.189> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
out since the 1970s would either it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
out since the 1970s would either it
basically<00:01:24.900> works<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.130> underlying

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
basically works on that underlying

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
basically works on that underlying
problem<00:01:27.030> makes<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.720> insulin<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.439> more

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
problem makes the the insulin work more

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
problem makes the the insulin work more
effectively<00:01:29.689> decreases<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> amount<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
effectively decreases the amount of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
effectively decreases the amount of
sugar<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.920> liver<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.369> making<00:01:32.970> because

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
sugar that the liver is making because

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
sugar that the liver is making because
the<00:01:33.240> liver<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.530> sugar<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the liver you see make sugar it's a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.130 
the liver you see make sugar it's a
factory<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:36.090> why<00:01:36.299> when<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.900> night

factory that's why when you go all night

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
factory that's why when you go all night
without<00:01:37.290> eating<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.920> wake<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.340> the

without eating you wake up in the
morning<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.729> sugar<00:01:38.880> may<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.119> high<00:01:39.420> with

morning your sugar may be high with

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
morning your sugar may be high with
diabetes<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.920> liver<00:01:41.250> new<00:01:41.820> sugar

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

of control well metformin tends to put a
damper<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.500> very<00:01:49.829> effective

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
damper on that so it's very effective

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
damper on that so it's very effective
and<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.479> inexpensive<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> doesn't

called<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.420> incretin<00:02:31.230> system<00:02:32.160> we've<00:02:32.700> been

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
called the incretin system we've been

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.550 
called the incretin system we've been
we've<00:02:33.209> discovered<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.989> last<00:02:34.200> few<00:02:34.500> years

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
we've discovered in the last few years

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.369 
we've discovered in the last few years
that<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.519> our<00:02:35.760> bowel<00:02:36.420> our<00:02:36.690> stomach<00:02:37.200> our

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
that that our bowel our stomach our

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.680 
that that our bowel our stomach our
intestines<00:02:37.980> are<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:39.060> hormone

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
intestines are actually hormone

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.080 
intestines are actually hormone
secreting<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.549> hormones<00:02:41.760> they

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
secreting and all the hormones they

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.960 
secreting and all the hormones they
secrete<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.049> with<00:02:43.349> food<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.340> hunger

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
secrete have to do with food and hunger

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.430 
secrete have to do with food and hunger
and<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:47.090> decrease<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.450> tendency

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
and so if you can decrease the tendency

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.740 
and so if you can decrease the tendency
that<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.799> sensation<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.610> hunger<00:02:50.849> with<00:02:51.569> these

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that the sensation of hunger with these

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.099 
that the sensation of hunger with these
medications<00:02:52.609> people<00:02:53.609> don't<00:02:53.970> eat<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
medications people don't eat as much and

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.329 
medications people don't eat as much and
they<00:02:55.590> don't<00:02:55.739> hallucinate<00:02:56.430> about<00:02:56.849> Twinkies
