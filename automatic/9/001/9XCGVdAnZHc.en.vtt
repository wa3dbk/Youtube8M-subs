 hi guys in this video sees face 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.770
 in the art very nice to make with 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.230
 this choir here on the ring finger 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 panda sizes i hope you like vi 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 he will leave a kiss in the art bye then 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.390
 first we do 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.970
 I made the trench coat on all my nails 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.790
 leaving only passing on the ring finger a 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:41.309
 rosÃ© classic as I always use this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 dell'essen sprite then and do one 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.829
 crescent species above we say from that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.719
 takes all the nail that figures to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 panda head ok more or less must 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.100
 come this effect here therefore a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.679
 half circle or used a white 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.040
 I always chalk this use for 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.580
 do the running trend and that's the number 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580
 12 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:18.360
 ok then we take the black glaze and it is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.159
 a daughter with a double and thin tip 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 to make eyes the ears and noses no 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.649
 so let's take a drop of nail polish 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649
 black 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.910
 and let's go make the ears 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 ok 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.920
 this must come here then we do 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.920
 eyes a little below 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.520
 and finally the central nose 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 this one has to come after you wonder 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.830
 we take the white enamel and go to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.170
 put another drop on the drop 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.600
 sheet that we will use to make 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.090
 the inside of the eyes of the cream for 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.090
 embellish anyway to make sense of 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:29.390
 so that it will be better anyway 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:32.390
 design ok let's fill our eyes like that 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 inside of 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.849
 so and with the deduced from the tip 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.230
 thin 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.989
 let's take another drop and do a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.420
 pellet very very thin to a 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:03.450
 very nose side of the cream 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:08.130
 so small after that we take the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:13.049
 top coat as always I use my own 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.350
 essence decays gel effect and passes it on 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.840
 all the nails I hope the part i 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.729
 both liked it and it was very very fast 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.340
 however in the very simple art that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.570
 they can all do and I hope that you 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.040
 like it anyway see you at the next 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.260

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.370
