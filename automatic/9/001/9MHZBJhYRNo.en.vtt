00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello! Today I will tell you how to make a lightsaber at home 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 We bought 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 Wooden round stick 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.460
 Flagellation 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.140
 and color tape 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.180
 in the pharmacy bought a band-aid 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.000
 and you need to take big scissors. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.080
 First you need to choose the color of the tape, blue suits me 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.840
 Now I will start wrapping my wand 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.240
 Now we are going to wind a little bit. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.500
 Here we have a wound wand. It is only necessary to cut the tape 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 All lightsaber ready :) 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 Next we need to roll 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 jedi sword hilt 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 What would make the beginning of the handle 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 we will need a medical adhesive plaster. 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 next we reel 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.840
 next we reel our string 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
 and you have to go home 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.820
 another adhesive plaster 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.960
 and that's how you see 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 we almost made the handle 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 now only 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.680
 cut off the end 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 adhesive plaster 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 now 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 and here we are homemade scotch tape 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 and adhesive plaster 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.540
 now we have a lightsaber 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.740
 and we can be in battles 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.740
 in space 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.740
 And to fight on lightsabers as in star wars 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420
