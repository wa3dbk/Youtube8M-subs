 I bring a new video of gta 5 and today I 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 I bring a tutorial of something that you have 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 asked a lot of people in the latter 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 videos it seems that you have disposed of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 agreement or what good you already have of the game 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.040
 and you want to get money and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.630
 how to get money a lot easy and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 fast in gta 5 so good I 've 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.140
 I done everything I could I'll 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.420
 comment on a list that I have made worth of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 the bestial way to make money 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 something simpler is worth so good 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.250
 most amazing and easiest and fastest way 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.290
 to make money is to invest in the stock market 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 ok I'll tell you the strategy 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 perfect because you are going to meet a friend 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.059
 that is called lester is worth that we are going to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 give type missions kill the boss of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 a company or whatever it is not then he 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
 as you can see in the background 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 video is going to say for example let's 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 kill the boss of such and then then the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.160
 the shares of such company are going to go up 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 not then what he says is very 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.640
 important you have to pay attention in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.140
 anything goes if it tells you that the options of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.149
 such a company will rise when you 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.430
 kill such a guy what you have to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.200
 to do is to invest all the money in the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 company that has told you that it will go up 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.890
 good if you do not know how to do it you will have it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.530
 background in the video you already know that it is a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.149
 through the mobile you put you internet 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.429
 you give services and money or something or 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.060
 service money is called you put in 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.369
 the first two that are from companies of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.409
 this not to be able to invest a month in 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.329
 market and you look for what he told you 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 exactly invest all your money 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.310
 It's worth it and the safest thing is that in one hour 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.259
 or so you have doubled or if you have a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.929
 the best 500 thousand euros and you put it 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.250
 when I take it out within an hour 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.720
 you're going to have double or it's a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 bestiality and the more money you have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.679
 Well, you're going to win more, that's not what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 First, do not invest in the stock market 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.890
 Lester's recommendation later is 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.709
 invest and invest in stock market with the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 recommendation that makes you own 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.899
 Internet page that you get and you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.209
 do not start within what are the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.829
 markets and that and right will be about 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.739
 little signs that also taught us that 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.959
 will then put such a company is booming and 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.840
 is going up a lot the actions or such 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.069
 company is in decline is very bad 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.690
 well you also have to do 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.890
 case that's worth it when I tell you that a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.329
 company is very well that they are winning 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.040
 in your actions 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.230
 you get in the market 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.209
 The company invests is everything or else 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.709
 it is rooted by it invests in less but I 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.939
 I usually invest anything goes when he says 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.459
 such a company is doing well, because I invest 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.680
 and all the time because I'm good at and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.290
 the dim was more the bestial form of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.909
 earn money but with difference in nothing 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.260
 in nothing that the domains at the beginning 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.150
 maybe it costs you a little but nothing that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.340
 you dominate you are going to win a lot 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.340
 good money another way to make money 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.079
 they are clicks or gaps in the game 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.500
 with those who can earn a lot 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.959
 very quick money okay I think there is one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 I have seen that it is to win 12 thousand 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.670
 dollars every nothing every 15 seconds and 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 another is the same process every 15 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.859
 seconds with 7500 worth those videos do not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.569
 I'm going to not put in the background but 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.280
 I'm going to leave the tutorials of how 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.459
 do those glitch in the description of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.780
 the friendly channels that I've seen that have 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.829
 I uploaded this tutorial so I 'm going to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.450
 leave at the discretion in case you want 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.220
 to pass is good something that you should 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.600
 take advantage now that you can because 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.370
 Surely fix it soon 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.620
 and another thing another way to make money 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.910
 very good that I have realized what 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.960
 I have not seen anybody upload it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
 that nobody has explained at the moment 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.910
 so good is a few small favors 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.770
 what we do to people to see in plan 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.990
 when you go down the street objectively to 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.150
 the games maybe you see someone 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.010
 is stealing the bag from an aunt or that 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.540
 someone has stolen the bike from another 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.210
 they have stolen a motorcycle or whatever 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.820
 any footprint of that then you 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.680
 you can go to the thief you kill him for example 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.300
 no and recover what was meant 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.580
 a motorcycle does not recover the motorcycle that is 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.010
 has stolen and you can choose to stay 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.570
 side return not as if about 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.460
 the money not if the roman money gives you 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.870
 the same option as giving it or going and if 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.970
 you return what you have to do 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.410
 always in all cases it is to return it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.580
 It's worth it because it's going to come out much more 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.980
 profitable if I'm going to tell you why 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.230
 generally the temptation says fuck 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.970
 Well, I've taken two thousand dollars as 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.820
 first I take no but what happens is 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.460
 that if you go and give that back to the guy at 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.410
 that they were stealing him normally or 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.480
 well not normally but sometimes 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.150
 what happens is that that guy at two 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.160
 days he calls you for example and gives you a 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.109
 incredible amount of money for example 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.449
 I gave him back the other day 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.189
 one that was being stolen and 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.770
 after the couple of days when they passed 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.120
 two days and he called me and told me that many 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.439
 thank you I had seen that it was a 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.449
 person who had a lot of courage or I do not know 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:30.340
 that my mother told me that he was 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.319
 billionaire and he did not need the 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.750
 money so what he's going to do is every 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.669
 month is going to give me a hundred thousand euros so 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.139
 imagine you for a bike that is 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.030
 give back what I'm going to earn 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.860
 about a hundred thousand euros every month I will 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.180
 give away like that for the face so I 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.379
 I recommend that that kind of thing 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.939
 return there is always because in the end 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.960
 always to leave more profitable and good 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:50.529
 it's a good way to also win 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.449
 money otherwise business you see that 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.470
 good in the game and several businesses like 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.110
 for example 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.560
 the scrapping of cars or movies or 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.330
 any sale business or 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.730
 transport of drugs for example with the 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.990
 that has the clover not at the beginning that 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.490
 has some planes to make transportation 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.090
 all those businesses that can be 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.770
 buy for the different characters 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.880
 they are very expensive in the bitch they have are 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.530
 quite expensive at first but 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.960
 finally they will come out profitable there 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.390
 because every month or every week I do not know 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.070
 how much that is going to give an income and 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.390
 finally, if you throw hours at 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.550
 you will recover it very easily 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.110
 so one of those are all the ways 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.630
 What do I think about making money? 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.520
 fast good the first one is the fastest 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.010
 and already according to what the business is 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.480
 what would be slowest and not at the beginning 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.700
 we would have even losses but good 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.960
 finally it would be profitable so this one 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.760
 ok I think that 's all I know 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.670
 So far how to make money in 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.130
 gta I recommend you very very seriously or 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.450
 you look at the bag 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.800
 very important because it is a city 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.980
 amazing is a way to make money 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.350
 bestial especially in the case of our 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.000
 friend lester are very attentive to the 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.669
 conversations when I tell them how 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.290
 company is going to go up or they will upload their 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.080
 actions you can invest all your 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.030
 money is worth that you are going to cover 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.590
 it's going to multiply very easy so 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.439
 nothing is worth, I have nothing more than 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.870
 say I hope you liked it 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.039
 serve primarily to serve you and nothing 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.300
 it works for you, I'm telling you 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.250
 for the comments and nothing were we 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:23.779
 we see in the next video chao 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.779
