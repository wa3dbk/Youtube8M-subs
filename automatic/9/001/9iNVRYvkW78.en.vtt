Pacquiao mayweather cotto or Mosley I

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.049 
Pacquiao mayweather cotto or Mosley I
think<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> mayweather<00:00:14.580> marquez<00:00:15.000> fight

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
think the mayweather marquez fight

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000 
think the mayweather marquez fight
wasn't<00:00:15.570> selling<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.230> i<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.619> why<00:00:16.859> she

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
wasn't selling so i think that's why she

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
wasn't selling so i think that's why she
had<00:00:17.160> her<00:00:17.369> Trev<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> sudden<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.480> i<00:00:18.570> think

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
had her Trev all of a sudden and i think

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.359 
had her Trev all of a sudden and i think
you'll<00:00:18.900> fight<00:00:19.080> he'll<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.070> cow<00:00:20.310> butt

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.490 
you'll fight he'll go up a cow butt
thing<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.970> he<00:00:21.630> can't<00:00:21.810> hide<00:00:22.020> till<00:00:22.230> next<00:00:22.470> year

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
thing is he can't hide till next year

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
thing is he can't hide till next year
right<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.130> loose<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.580> paki<00:00:23.820> i<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

fight cotto on november 14th and you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.540 
fight cotto on november 14th and you
know<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.160> looking<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.490> right

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
know that's what I'm looking at right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.429 
know that's what I'm looking at right
now<00:00:29.699> Mosley's<00:00:30.630> making<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
now Mosley's making a little bit of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
now Mosley's making a little bit of
noise<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.009> they're<00:00:32.880> making<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.420> offer

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
noise and I'm they're making a big offer

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.400 
noise and I'm they're making a big offer
but<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.790> fight<00:00:36.410> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
but I think the right fight is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
but I think the right fight is
Mayweather<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.730> feel<00:00:38.910> he's<00:00:39.090> easiest

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
Mayweather because I feel he's easiest

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479 
Mayweather because I feel he's easiest
of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> three<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.829> since<00:00:41.070> he's<00:00:41.280> not

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
of the three but since he's not

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.270 
of the three but since he's not
available<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.899> kodos<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.620> next<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
available I think kodos the next one in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970 
available I think kodos the next one in
line<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:45.989> maybe<00:00:46.200> we'll<00:00:46.800> fight

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
line and so I think maybe we'll fight

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.970 
line and so I think maybe we'll fight
cotto<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> November<00:00:48.539> 14th<00:00:48.960> many<00:00:49.829> weather

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
cotto on the November 14th many weather

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
cotto on the November 14th many weather
would<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.210> general<00:00:51.510> public

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
would be the one that the general public

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.150 
would be the one that the general public
would<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
would probably go for is what would you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
would probably go for is what would you
reckon<00:00:53.539> everyone<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> world<00:00:54.870> wants<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
reckon everyone in the world wants to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
reckon everyone in the world wants to
see<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> fight<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.000> truly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
see that fight but I really really truly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
see that fight but I really really truly
believe<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> Mayweather<00:00:58.379> doesn't<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
believe that Mayweather doesn't want to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
believe that Mayweather doesn't want to
fight<00:00:58.980> pacquiao<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.789> that's<00:00:59.969> why<00:01:00.120> he

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
fight pacquiao because that's why he

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.139 
fight pacquiao because that's why he
chose<00:01:00.390> Marquez<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.430> he's<00:01:02.430> always<00:01:02.640> talk<00:01:02.940> five

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
chose Marquez and he's always talk five

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.579 
chose Marquez and he's always talk five
years<00:01:03.329> he<00:01:03.480> didn't<00:01:03.719> used<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:03.989> margarita

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
years he didn't used to like margarita

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
years he didn't used to like margarita
now<00:01:04.830> he's<00:01:04.979> ducking<00:01:05.309> Manny<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.810> know

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
he says he doesn't that people but it's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.649 
he says he doesn't that people but it's
pretty<00:01:09.450> obvious<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.770> Amy<00:01:11.659> you

might become the next British champion
there's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> vacuum<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.070> perhaps

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
there's a bit of a vacuum now perhaps

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
there's a bit of a vacuum now perhaps

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and he could step into it definitely is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
and he could step into it definitely is

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
can see I can see how the conspiracy

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.300 
can see I can see how the conspiracy
theorists<00:05:32.110> are<00:05:32.169> getting<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.470> work<00:05:32.620> here<00:05:32.889> but<00:05:32.919> I

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
theorists are getting to work here but I

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.490 
theorists are getting to work here but I
also<00:05:33.700> think<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.180> Mayweather<00:05:34.750> would<00:05:35.169> want

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
also think that Mayweather would want

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.800 
also think that Mayweather would want
another<00:05:36.310> fight<00:05:36.639> before<00:05:36.970> coming<00:05:37.599> straight

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
another fight before coming straight

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.110 
another fight before coming straight
back<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.260> fight<00:05:38.530> against<00:05:39.010> Manny<00:05:39.729> Pacquiao

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
back this fight against Manny Pacquiao

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.670 
back this fight against Manny Pacquiao
because<00:05:40.389> if<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.570> was<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.960> happen<00:05:41.139> for

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
because if that was to happen for

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.170 
because if that was to happen for
example<00:05:42.130> in<00:05:42.220> November<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:42.729> it's<00:05:42.910> clear<00:05:43.120> that

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
example in November and it's clear that

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.670 
example in November and it's clear that
Pacquiao<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:43.990> not<00:05:44.200> going<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.349> be<00:05:44.440> ready<00:05:44.590> to

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
Pacquiao is not going to be ready to

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.860 
Pacquiao is not going to be ready to
file<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.190> until<00:05:45.580> October<00:05:46.000> no<00:05:46.120> vent<00:05:46.479> well<00:05:46.720> that

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
file it until October no vent well that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.360 
file it until October no vent well that
that<00:05:47.050> means<00:05:47.260> that<00:05:47.470> Mayweather's<00:05:48.010> been<00:05:48.130> out<00:05:48.250> of

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
that means that Mayweather's been out of

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.250 
that means that Mayweather's been out of
the<00:05:48.430> ring<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.820> 24<00:05:49.479> in<00:05:49.510> best<00:05:49.750> part<00:05:49.960> of<00:05:50.080> two

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
the ring for 24 in best part of two

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.900 
the ring for 24 in best part of two
years<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:50.740> I<00:05:50.919> don't<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.520> he'd<00:05:51.729> go

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
years and I don't think that he'd go

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.400 
years and I don't think that he'd go
straight<00:05:52.150> into<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.419> fight<00:05:52.660> it's<00:05:52.840> bigger<00:05:52.990> pecker

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.249 
ahead that far they look they're looking
at<00:07:23.099> not<00:07:23.430> six<00:07:23.699> months<00:07:23.789> not<00:07:24.419> twelve<00:07:24.719> months<00:07:25.019> but

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 
at not six months not twelve months but

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.439 
at not six months not twelve months but
often<00:07:25.740> 18<00:07:26.249> months<00:07:26.610> down<00:07:26.729> the<00:07:26.789> line<00:07:26.969> and<00:07:27.330> I

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
often 18 months down the line and I

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.839 
often 18 months down the line and I
think<00:07:27.719> that<00:07:27.869> we're<00:07:28.439> katoh<00:07:28.769> is<00:07:29.159> at<00:07:29.430> the<00:07:29.550> moment

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:29.849 
think that we're katoh is at the moment

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.489 
think that we're katoh is at the moment
I<00:07:29.909> think<00:07:29.969> he's<00:07:30.240> lost<00:07:30.479> a<00:07:30.719> bit<00:07:30.869> of<00:07:30.899> the<00:07:31.080> luster

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:31.499 
I think he's lost a bit of the luster

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:33.350 
I think he's lost a bit of the luster
than<00:07:31.649> he<00:07:31.769> had<00:07:32.009> at<00:07:32.279> light<00:07:32.580> welterweight<00:07:32.610> a<00:07:33.089> lot

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
than he had at light welterweight a lot

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.730 
than he had at light welterweight a lot
of<00:07:33.449> people<00:07:33.719> believe<00:07:33.809> he's<00:07:33.990> better<00:07:34.469> at

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
of people believe he's better at

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.230 
of people believe he's better at
welterweight<00:07:35.219> because<00:07:35.669> he<00:07:35.759> carries<00:07:36.119> the

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
welterweight because he carries the

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.480 
welterweight because he carries the
weight<00:07:36.419> better<00:07:36.719> but<00:07:37.439> I<00:07:37.469> think<00:07:37.860> that<00:07:37.919> there<00:07:38.459> is

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
weight better but I think that there is

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.399 
weight better but I think that there is
a<00:07:38.610> vulnerability<00:07:39.209> about<00:07:39.539> him<00:07:39.899> and<00:07:40.079> I<00:07:40.139> think

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:40.409 
a vulnerability about him and I think

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:42.079 
a vulnerability about him and I think
that's<00:07:40.559> a<00:07:40.680> big<00:07:40.889> seller<00:07:41.219> and<00:07:41.519> I<00:07:41.610> think<00:07:41.849> katoh

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.089 
that's a big seller and I think katoh

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.209 
that's a big seller and I think katoh
against<00:07:42.990> any<00:07:43.169> of<00:07:43.349> those<00:07:43.469> names<00:07:43.529> that<00:07:44.069> we've

against any of those names that we've

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:46.069 
against any of those names that we've
been<00:07:44.369> mentioning<00:07:44.819> is<00:07:44.969> a<00:07:45.029> big<00:07:45.329> fight<00:07:45.539> is<00:07:45.779> a<00:07:45.809> good

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:46.079 
been mentioning is a big fight is a good

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.230
