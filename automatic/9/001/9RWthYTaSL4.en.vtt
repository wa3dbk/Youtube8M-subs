 frank that is the creator the man who 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.930
 he made this car on a scale of one fifth 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.869
 or scale 1 to 5 which is then fantastic 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.669
 I think it's one of the cars 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.430
 scale better facts that I've seen in my 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.010
 life without a doubt impressive the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.440
 degree of detail including seams 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.570
 in the steering wheel everything but everything is 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.570

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.660

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 ailerons neither the rims nor the wheels neither 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.479
 nothing all those in this size no no 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 I have a store where I find 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.520
 me where to buy these things each of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.590
 these pieces were made in specific there 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.290
 some made by computer in printed 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.080
 in 3d or laser cut but myself 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.780
 I made and I sent and sent them cut 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.360
 all the body of the car you have made by hand 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.580
 totally no no for counting is that hand 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.620
 and today everything for example 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 You took this work of art 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 put at the end stop counting the time 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.010
 because it tells me it's depressing but we're 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.950
 talking about four months around 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.130
 four months are a little more and more or 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 less on average is the time then 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.660
 hours a day I do not know but but if in a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.330
 average of four months or so hey 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.890
 and to see us why this car 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.620
 what specifically also the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.120
 configuration because it's talking 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.070
 with you tell me what is the configuration 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230

 93 star and when it makes you 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.560
 remember the happy moments in mclaren 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.020
 we had three championships many wins 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.960
 personally for me the season 93 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.270
 with possibly the worst mclarens 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.330
 that at least the worst he handled 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.430
 it was the year that better handling that won 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.800
 five races against lan continue 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.360

 over at the end Sunday time 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.280
 unforgettable where Monaco won that is the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.080
 key always the last the last 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.970
 Victory in Monaco Japan 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.500
 It also rained and the last one 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.740
 this car represents the grand prize 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.900
 australia where in the end it occurs in the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.540
 reconciliation with alan prost then 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.610
 very important in the race and in the end what 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 what happens after what we saw of me 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.400

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.080

 he said goodbye before he started 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.240
 the grill is very emotionally 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.400
 dismissed Ayrton senna and he 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.590
 to start his last race the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.450
 wins and after that comes the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.820
 reconciliation with alan prost then 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.800

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.360
