hi everyone welcome back to another

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.690 
hi everyone welcome back to another
tutorial<00:00:05.399> in<00:00:05.899> this<00:00:06.899> tutorial<00:00:07.250> as<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.550> see

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
tutorial in this tutorial as you can see

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.750 
tutorial in this tutorial as you can see
this<00:00:08.790> picture<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.679> slightly<00:00:10.760> underexposed

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
this picture it's slightly underexposed

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.650 
this picture it's slightly underexposed
and<00:00:12.800> we<00:00:13.800> don't<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.130> much<00:00:14.460> detail<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.240> this

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and we don't have much detail on this

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.490 
and we don't have much detail on this
statue<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.310> very<00:00:17.730> simple<00:00:18.179> trick<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.019> go

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
statue so very simple trick is to go

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.670 
statue so very simple trick is to go
into<00:00:19.770> create<00:00:20.310> new<00:00:20.460> adjustment<00:00:20.970> layer<00:00:21.030> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
into create new adjustment layer and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.950 
into create new adjustment layer and
we're<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:23.130> levels<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.420> basically<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we're going into levels so basically it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.980 
we're going into levels so basically it
creates<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.460> layer<00:00:26.910> where<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.750> just

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
creates just a layer where we can just

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
creates just a layer where we can just
just<00:00:28.560> apply<00:00:28.859> where<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.340> adjust<00:00:29.460> levels

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
just apply where we can adjust levels

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.259 
just apply where we can adjust levels
and<00:00:30.900> adds<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.320> layer<00:00:31.439> mask<00:00:31.560> well<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.699> don't<00:00:33.149> want

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
and adds a layer mask well I don't want

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.180 
and adds a layer mask well I don't want
to<00:00:33.420> adjust<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> levels<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.289> just<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to adjust the levels I just want to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
to adjust the levels I just want to
change<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> blending<00:00:36.180> mode<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:37.140> I'm

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
change the blending mode and what I'm

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
change the blending mode and what I'm
going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> change<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.360> screen<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
going to do is change to screen and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
some more you duplicate layer control or

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.450 
some more you duplicate layer control or
command<00:00:50.309> J<00:00:50.780> or<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.320> drag<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:52.980> the

command J or you can drag it into the
new<00:00:53.610> layer<00:00:53.790> icon<00:00:54.320> however<00:00:55.910> sometimes<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
new layer icon however sometimes as you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
new layer icon however sometimes as you
can<00:00:58.860> see<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> case<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.030> nice

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.200 
can see in this case this is a nice
picture<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.399> lost<00:01:02.610> some<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
picture to do that as if we lost some of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.499 
picture to do that as if we lost some of
the<00:01:03.300> detail<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.809> trees<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.360> we're

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
the detail on trees and so what we're

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.169 
the detail on trees and so what we're
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.719> do<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.859> way<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> mask<00:01:08.310> yes

select<00:01:10.020> brush<00:01:10.350> painting<00:01:11.039> in<00:01:11.189> black<00:01:11.219> I'm<00:01:11.850> going

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
select brush painting in black I'm going

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.309 
select brush painting in black I'm going
to<00:01:13.609> make<00:01:14.609> my<00:01:14.759> brush<00:01:14.789> slightly<00:01:15.569> bigger<00:01:15.929> to<00:01:16.170> make

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
to make my brush slightly bigger to make

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:25.219 
to make my brush slightly bigger to make
it<00:01:16.469> quicker<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.679> can<00:01:22.859> see<00:01:24.229> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it quicker and as you can see it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.969 
it quicker and as you can see it's
improving<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.689> lot<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.709> more

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
improving a lot more so we have more

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.109 
improving a lot more so we have more
detail<00:01:30.139> in<00:01:31.139> the<00:01:31.349> picture<00:01:31.649> itself<00:01:33.529> not<00:01:34.529> only<00:01:35.119> on

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
detail in the picture itself not only on

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.249 
detail in the picture itself not only on
the<00:01:36.479> grains<00:01:36.779> of<00:01:38.569> trees<00:01:39.569> and<00:01:39.840> bushes<00:01:40.020> and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
picture we go to the same step so we go

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.430 
picture we go to the same step so we go
to<00:02:27.260> new<00:02:27.590> adjustment<00:02:28.070> layer<00:02:28.480> levels<00:02:29.480> however

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
to new adjustment layer levels however

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.700 
to new adjustment layer levels however
instead<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:31.010> going<00:02:31.340> full<00:02:31.940> screen<00:02:32.870> let's<00:02:33.470> go<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
instead of going full screen let's go to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.530 
instead of going full screen let's go to
multiply<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.320> go<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.860> now<00:02:37.240> we<00:02:38.240> can

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
multiply and there we go and now we can

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.580 
multiply and there we go and now we can
use<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.830> layer<00:02:40.490> mask<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.270> now<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:42.110> have<00:02:42.350> more

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
use the layer mask and now we have more

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.260 
use the layer mask and now we have more
contrast<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:45.580> background<00:02:46.580> but<00:02:46.760> let's<00:02:47.090> say

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
contrast on the background but let's say

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
contrast on the background but let's say
we<00:02:47.420> want<00:02:48.370> bring<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.520> slightly<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:51.800> statue<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
we want bring up slightly this statue so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.770 
we want bring up slightly this statue so
I'm<00:02:55.100> going<00:02:56.050> I'm<00:02:57.050> going<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.320> be<00:02:57.410> very<00:02:57.860> fussy

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I'm going I'm going to be very fussy

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.610 
I'm going I'm going to be very fussy
purposes<00:02:59.780> for<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.020> tutorial<00:03:01.180> but<00:03:02.410> at<00:03:03.410> least

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
purposes for this tutorial but at least

you<00:03:03.920> get<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.280> idea<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:06.350> that's<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
you get the idea and I think that's the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.170 
you get the idea and I think that's the
most<00:03:06.800> important<00:03:07.280> thing<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.880> get<00:03:08.060> the

was to make it proper selection out to
zoom<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.610> everything<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:45.300> we<00:03:45.540> all<00:03:45.660> know<00:03:45.930> but

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
zoom and everything as we all know but

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.890 
zoom and everything as we all know but
I'm<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.280> going<00:03:47.520> like<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:51.660> see

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
I'm just going like so and you can see

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.070 
I'm just going like so and you can see
the<00:03:52.200> difference<00:03:52.880> before<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:55.190> after<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.080> play

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
the difference before and after so play

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.280 
the difference before and after so play
with<00:03:58.110> your<00:03:58.350> blending<00:03:58.650> modes<00:03:58.860> because<00:04:00.140> as<00:04:01.140> you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
with your blending modes because as you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.810 
with your blending modes because as you
can<00:04:01.410> see<00:04:01.620> back<00:04:01.920> if<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.880> had<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.630> layer<00:04:04.820> with

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
can see back if we had a just layer with

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.750 
can see back if we had a just layer with
just<00:04:05.850> levels<00:04:07.310> nothing<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:10.170> darken

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
just levels nothing and get darken

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.420 
just levels nothing and get darken
creasing<00:04:11.760> effect<00:04:12.830> multiply<00:04:13.830> another<00:04:14.130> one

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
creasing effect multiply another one

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.620 
creasing effect multiply another one
color<00:04:14.910> burn<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:17.549> can<00:04:17.760> create<00:04:18.000> some<00:04:18.090> cool

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
color burn and you can create some cool

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.280 
color burn and you can create some cool
effects<00:04:19.020> and<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.670> case<00:04:20.910> using<00:04:21.330> multiply

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
effects and in this case using multiply

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.460 
effects and in this case using multiply
and<00:04:22.590> swing<00:04:22.980> can<00:04:23.390> actually<00:04:24.390> help<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.750> improve
