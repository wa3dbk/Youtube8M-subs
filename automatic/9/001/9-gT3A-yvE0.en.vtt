00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.519
 national meteorological service arrives 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.500
 gentlemen, we are reporting on the 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.599
 trajectory that is just this 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.910
 wind in this moisture-laden wind 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.680
 that reaches mainly towards 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.199
 northern states all states of the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.090
 north are covered by this humidity and 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.220
 cloudiness that has been generated there in the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 peaceful and that there will be some 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.920
 rainfall in all states that 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.410
 they form a border with the American union 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.719
 direct to occasionally moderate such 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.300
 time some strong in the state of 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.370
 tamaulipas and also wait we see that the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.629
 torrent of you all the torrent of 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.720
 humidity that comes from the Pacific 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.510
 continues to provide something of this towards the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.220
 southern and southeastern states do not tell 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510
 all the states of the center where 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.370
 we will also continue waiting for that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.260
 cloudiness in the evening-night with 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670
 precipitations in these hours where 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.350
 there will be slight moderate in the greatest 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.540
 part of the center table will be 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.700
 some strong rainfall and little 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.559
 beyond San Luis Potosí if we go 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.210
 towards veracruz - towards the east 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.329
 we would also expect some strong in 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.570
 veracruz and craving in southeastern Chiapas 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:12.320
 some strong in a very isolated way the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.450
 rest then look at the Phoenician 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.850
 most of the West as 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 We would wait and some in Jalisco very 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.270
 light very dispersed as in the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.160
 state of micro cat 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 and the good clear temperatures ag the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.830
 temperatures remain however 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.660
 really very high in most 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 of the Mexican Republic see you the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.550
 northwest with some clouds some 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 rainfall is missing due to this situation 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.240
 from the entrance the arrival to the influx 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.900
 of humidity that comes from the Pacific 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 that configures is a cloud ceiling some 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.310
 precipitation towards the afternoon in the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 night of the northwest states and the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.869
 north of the Pacific coast towards 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 the sides of the center and the northeast 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.860
 we would also expect some 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.360
 Isolated rainfall is like this and with 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.710
 temperatures as you can observe 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.910
 look at really very high values 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.830
 27 28 29 36 31 32 maximum temperature 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.660
 the environment is really very hot 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.239
 for most of the country the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.950
 west equal 30 to 32 degrees the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.729
 maximum temperature a clear sky to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.280
 Partly cloudy with rainfall 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.140
 dispersed as in the rest of the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.850
 center table south of sight 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.340
 from the center we would also expect something from 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.489
 precipitation 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.180
 and we will wait for temperatures from 32 to 35 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.250
 degrees in the warrior state but if 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.860
 of moderate occasionally strong the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.720
 precipitation in the southeast 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.500
 mainly in the south of veracruz and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.060
 in the state of chiapas the sky very 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.379
 sunny most of the day by the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.180
 afternoon the cloudiness increases 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.129
 the temperatures see you values 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.230
 really very very high that almost 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.209
 they reach 40 degrees at some point 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.110
 the Mexican southeast and do not say in the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.890
 yucatan peninsula see you 42 44 already 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.260
 in measure 31 33 in cancún and well then 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.209
 we follow with very careful shoulders of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.160
 temperatures also in the peninsula of 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.840
 Yucatan for the capital of the republic 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.190
 here in the city of mexico 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.660
 we are still waiting for values ​​of 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.980
 also very high temperatures 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.420
 observe you from 28 of 20 to 30 of plan 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.060
 the maximum temperature for the city of 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.060
 Mexico the minimum of 13 to 14 and the sky 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.000
 very solar sky most of the day 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.400
 thighs and in the afternoon this little humidity 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.049
 that comes from the Pacific and that arrives 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.880
 to the center of the country with this value of 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.920
 temperature with this environment so 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.780
 warm good because this situation of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.250
 humidity begins to form some 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.750
 cloudy and can be detached 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.680
 only some rainfall but 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.050
 also the stormy activity of 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.240
 electrical activity and also the fall 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.530
 of hail you have to be very careful with 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.060
 that condition is the most important thing that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.350
 we have you from the service 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.350
 national meteorological 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.470
