hey everyone so today's video is going

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.150 
hey everyone so today's video is going
to<00:00:05.000> be<00:00:05.120> three<00:00:05.510> nail<00:00:05.750> tutorials<00:00:06.319> in<00:00:06.500> one<00:00:06.830> video

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
to be three nail tutorials in one video

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.640 
to be three nail tutorials in one video
because<00:00:07.490> on<00:00:07.730> their<00:00:07.940> own<00:00:08.149> I<00:00:08.360> thought<00:00:08.870> each<00:00:09.170> nail

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
because on their own I thought each nail

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.560 
because on their own I thought each nail
tutorial<00:00:10.250> was<00:00:10.370> a<00:00:10.400> little<00:00:10.730> bit<00:00:10.850> too<00:00:10.969> simple<00:00:11.389> to

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
tutorial was a little bit too simple to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.270 
tutorial was a little bit too simple to
you<00:00:12.049> know<00:00:12.139> have<00:00:12.289> a<00:00:12.350> whole<00:00:12.559> entire<00:00:12.860> video<00:00:13.219> on

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
you know have a whole entire video on

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.070 
you know have a whole entire video on
but<00:00:13.700> together<00:00:13.879> I<00:00:14.209> think<00:00:14.420> it<00:00:14.780> gives<00:00:14.869> you<00:00:15.049> a

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
but together I think it gives you a

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.590 
but together I think it gives you a
great<00:00:15.469> variation<00:00:16.430> on<00:00:16.610> tutorials<00:00:17.119> you<00:00:17.240> can<00:00:17.270> try

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
great variation on tutorials you can try

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.260 
great variation on tutorials you can try

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
out and just kind of shows you the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.370 
out and just kind of shows you the
possibilities<00:00:20.270> with<00:00:20.510> using<00:00:20.870> dotting<00:00:21.170> tools

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
possibilities with using dotting tools

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.830 
possibilities with using dotting tools
and<00:00:21.650> using<00:00:21.890> just<00:00:22.220> dots<00:00:22.490> as<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.760> manicure<00:00:23.480> idea

cut the ends off q-tips and then use the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.640 
cut the ends off q-tips and then use the
little<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:10.820> stub<00:01:11.240> on<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.540> q-tip<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.170> create

the dots well that's a lot more

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.580 
the dots well that's a lot more
time-consuming<00:01:14.360> especially<00:01:14.750> when<00:01:15.500> you're

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
time-consuming especially when you're

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.630 
time-consuming especially when you're
working<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.980> lot<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.160> different<00:01:16.310> colors

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it's just fun and interesting and you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.820 
it's just fun and interesting and you
can<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.630> any<00:03:00.840> colors<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.319> could<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.560> bright

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
can do any colors you could do bright

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
think the black and white gives a really

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.180 
think the black and white gives a really
cool<00:03:05.430> effect<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.750> yeah<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.470> hope<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.769> enjoyed

still<00:05:39.270> kind<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.570> choppy<00:05:39.840> looking<00:05:40.170> because<00:05:40.470> I

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
still kind of choppy looking because I

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.410 
still kind of choppy looking because I
haven't<00:05:40.740> put<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.980> topcoat<00:05:41.340> on<00:05:41.550> yet<00:05:41.850> so<00:05:42.300> I'm

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
haven't put a topcoat on yet so I'm

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.790 
haven't put a topcoat on yet so I'm
going<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.600> let<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:42.840> dry<00:05:43.110> then<00:05:43.290> come<00:05:43.470> back<00:05:43.500> and

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
going to let this dry then come back and

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:55.380 
going to let this dry then come back and
apply<00:05:44.040> my<00:05:44.220> top<00:05:44.250> coat<00:05:44.810> apply<00:05:45.810> my<00:05:46.020> top<00:05:46.050> coat

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.690 

I<00:05:55.480> almost<00:05:56.080> think<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.500> looks<00:05:56.710> like<00:05:56.890> nail

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
I almost think it looks like nail

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.850 
I almost think it looks like nail
stickers<00:05:58.180> like<00:05:58.390> Sally<00:05:58.690> Hansen<00:05:59.170> nail<00:05:59.200> art

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
stickers like Sally Hansen nail art

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.170 
stickers like Sally Hansen nail art
stickers<00:06:00.040> or<00:06:00.340> something<00:06:00.640> because<00:06:00.910> it<00:06:01.030> just

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
stickers or something because it just

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.760 
stickers or something because it just
looks<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:01.840> cool<00:06:02.110> and<00:06:02.290> especially<00:06:02.500> from

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
looks so cool and especially from

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.830 
looks so cool and especially from
farther<00:06:03.160> away<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.670> don't<00:06:04.270> think<00:06:04.420> anyone<00:06:04.750> would

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
farther away I don't think anyone would

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.960 
farther away I don't think anyone would
