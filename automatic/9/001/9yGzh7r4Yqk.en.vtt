00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
imploding I'm not get a quickie achieve

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
imploding I'm not get a quickie achieve
or<00:00:18.750> anything<00:00:19.170> I'm<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.529> taking<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> little<00:00:20.070> bit

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
or anything I'm just taking a little bit

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.519 
or anything I'm just taking a little bit
of<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> break<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:20.970> also<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.630> started<00:00:21.750> working

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of a break but also I started working

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.470 
of a break but also I started working
full<00:00:22.980> time<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.730> feels<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.150> weird<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
full time and it feels really weird to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
full time and it feels really weird to
say<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:24.990> I've<00:00:25.170> never<00:00:25.199> wait<00:00:25.710> before

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
say that because I've never wait before

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
say that because I've never wait before
so<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.670> not<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:26.910> first<00:00:27.180> job<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:28.019> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
so it's not my first job and I'm really

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
so it's not my first job and I'm really
enjoying<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.830> far<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.460> thought<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.090> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
one was reduced type 3 power and I was

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.000 
one was reduced type 3 power and I was
like<00:05:47.419> oh<00:05:47.450> okay<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.260> they<00:05:48.440> said<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.680> second

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
like oh okay and they said the second

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.290 
like oh okay and they said the second
one<00:05:49.130> that<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.340> got<00:05:49.490> which<00:05:49.640> i<00:05:49.729> think<00:05:49.790> is<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.090> bit

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
one that I got which i think is a bit

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.780 
one that I got which i think is a bit
more<00:05:50.450> kind<00:05:50.660> of<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:51.590> gives<00:05:51.770> more<00:05:52.010> coverage<00:05:52.520> oh

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
more kind of it gives more coverage oh

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.610 
more kind of it gives more coverage oh
and<00:05:53.150> then<00:05:53.300> on<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.540> back<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.720> this<00:05:54.050> you<00:05:54.440> have

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
and then on the back of this you have

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.380 
and then on the back of this you have
two<00:05:54.860> bowls<00:05:55.160> and<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.580> might<00:05:55.760> look<00:05:55.910> really<00:05:56.120> pretty

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
two bowls and I might look really pretty

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.779 
two bowls and I might look really pretty
and<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.410> reason<00:05:57.710> why<00:05:57.830> i<00:05:57.860> got<00:05:58.250> these<00:05:58.460> is

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
and the reason why i got these is

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.340 
and the reason why i got these is
because<00:05:59.030> I've<00:06:00.020> got

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
because I've got

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.650 
because I've got
come<00:06:00.740> up<00:06:00.860> in<00:06:01.010> August<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:01.610> we're<00:06:02.330> thinking

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
come up in August and we're thinking

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.420

wearing<00:06:02.870> saris<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:03.830> thought<00:06:04.040> it<00:06:04.190> would<00:06:04.280> get

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
wearing saris and I thought it would get

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.430 
wearing saris and I thought it would get
one<00:06:04.580> of<00:06:04.670> these<00:06:04.790> pups<00:06:05.180> to<00:06:05.480> wear<00:06:05.690> with<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.140> sorry

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
one of these pups to wear with the sorry

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.590 
one of these pups to wear with the sorry
I<00:06:06.800> got<00:06:07.070> black<00:06:07.430> because<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:07.940> think<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.420> style

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
I got black because I think the style

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.240 
I got black because I think the style
that<00:06:08.780> I'm<00:06:08.930> wearing<00:06:09.110> will<00:06:09.440> be<00:06:09.560> like<00:06:09.770> my<00:06:10.040> foot
