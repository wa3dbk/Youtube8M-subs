it on the top or just finding different
ways<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.090> voicings<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.320> cord<00:00:28.619> just

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
ways of voicings of the cord just

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.609 
ways of voicings of the cord just
repositioning<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.990> let<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.260> give<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> an

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
repositioning it so let me give you an

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.660 
repositioning it so let me give you an
example<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.600> back<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.140> flat<00:00:34.670> we're
