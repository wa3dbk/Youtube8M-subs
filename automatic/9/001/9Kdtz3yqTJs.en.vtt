not<00:00:15.580> plug<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.750> channel<00:00:17.170> on<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.740> back<00:00:17.890> strap

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
not plug the channel on the back strap

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.490 
not plug the channel on the back strap
of<00:00:18.340> your<00:00:18.490> block<00:00:18.820> as<00:00:19.690> you<00:00:19.869> all<00:00:19.990> know<00:00:20.170> they<00:00:20.320> sell

plugs<00:00:20.850> fit<00:00:21.850> in<00:00:22.029> there<00:00:22.740> some<00:00:23.740> say<00:00:23.890> you

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
plugs fit in there some say you

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.190 
plugs fit in there some say you
shouldn't<00:00:24.189> do<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.430> because<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.900> reason

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
shouldn't do that because the reason

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.019 
shouldn't do that because the reason
that<00:00:26.650> opening<00:00:27.010> is<00:00:27.130> there<00:00:27.340> is<00:00:27.460> in<00:00:27.580> case<00:00:27.760> if<00:00:27.939> you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
that opening is there is in case if you

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.890 
that opening is there is in case if you
have<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.150> type<00:00:28.390> 3<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:28.779> can<00:00:29.790> better<00:00:30.790> extract<00:00:31.570> the

this<00:00:35.110> was<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.320> manufacturing<00:00:36.040> reason<00:00:36.760> because

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
this was a manufacturing reason because

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.450 
this was a manufacturing reason because
you<00:00:38.110> have<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.380> maintain<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.860> integrity<00:00:39.130> and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
you have to maintain the integrity and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.389 
you have to maintain the integrity and
thickness<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.559> walls<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.920> grip<00:00:42.130> they

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
thickness of the walls of the grip they

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.010 
thickness of the walls of the grip they
all<00:00:42.520> have<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.790> be<00:00:42.820> uniform<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.420> if<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:43.660> feel

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
all have to be uniform and if you feel

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.849 
all have to be uniform and if you feel
that<00:00:44.730> channel<00:00:45.730> with<00:00:46.110> polymer<00:00:47.110> you'd<00:00:47.679> have

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
that channel with polymer you'd have

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.790 
that channel with polymer you'd have
extra<00:00:48.309> weight<00:00:48.519> and<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:50.050> wouldn't<00:00:50.289> be<00:00:50.379> all<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
extra weight and it wouldn't be all the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.020 
extra weight and it wouldn't be all the
same<00:00:51.070> thickness<00:00:51.429> it's<00:00:51.820> just<00:00:51.969> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
same thickness it's just the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.709 
same thickness it's just the
manufacturing<00:00:52.719> I<00:00:52.840> like<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.260> use<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.039> plug<00:00:54.719> for

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
manufacturing I like to use the plug for

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.299 
manufacturing I like to use the plug for
one<00:00:55.929> reason<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.379> one<00:00:56.589> reason<00:00:56.620> only

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
one reason and one reason only

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.060 
one reason and one reason only
nothing<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.789> do<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:57.969> cosmetics<00:00:59.070> aesthetics

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
none of that it's just what I do is I

in<00:01:20.649> there<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.829> also<00:01:21.040> have<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> firing<00:01:21.610> pin<00:01:21.939> safety

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
in there I also have a firing pin safety

in there I also have a firing pin safety
and<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.630> firing<00:01:22.930> pin<00:01:23.110> safety<00:01:23.320> spring<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.610> what<00:01:24.729> I

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
and a firing pin safety spring so what I

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.840 
and a firing pin safety spring so what I
do<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.119> I<00:01:25.329> roll<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.750> up<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.549> push<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.729> into

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
do is I roll it up and I push it into

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.590 
do is I roll it up and I push it into
the<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> channel

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.680 

push<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:38.190> since<00:01:38.730> just

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
push that all the way in and since just

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.600 
push that all the way in and since just
what<00:01:40.050> other<00:01:40.170> reason<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.830> connector<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> can't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
what other reason the connector I can't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
what other reason the connector I can't
fit<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:43.050> did<00:01:43.230> it<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.620> I<00:01:43.650> put

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
fit in there if I did it that way I put

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.520 
fit in there if I did it that way I put
that<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.460> last<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.420> I'll<00:01:45.480> push<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:46.050> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.930 

then<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:51.140> send<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.230> plug<00:01:52.440> home<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.610> make<00:01:53.790> the
