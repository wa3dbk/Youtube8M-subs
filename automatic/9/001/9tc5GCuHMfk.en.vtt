00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.780
 good friends from youtube 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.730
 and I want to make a small video 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.970
 tutorial for people the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.640
 little boys for people because it's a 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.790
 game for big and for little ones that 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.490
 want to play the destiny of a 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.000
 game that I found excellent so a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.790
 very very elegant game because 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.850
 it's very entertaining you get into that 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.830
 game and I thought it was excellent 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.550
 the first thing that you have to do 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.489
 is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.649
 what do they want they want to be a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.430
 gentleman a hunter a magician a 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.809
 priest if there are several options there 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 ones that he likes is the gentleman is 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.260
 fight with sword other hunters so 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 except I like a magician 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 in this case I will also put the magician 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.609
 because this is for my daughter 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 then let's put the magician and there we create 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.400
 a profile 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.400
 how is that going to be called 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.590
 let's go in 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.980
 that's what it takes and I'm going to 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.470
 show is like the basics so that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.080
 you are not suddenly and turning around 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.880
 what they have 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.730
 because because in the beginning he gave me more 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 well as durito but that after 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.710
 is done retirement that gets very good 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 is what it seems 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 why 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.210
 that is, that siesta excel 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.229
 what we put to care and they will 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.459
 it seems it's a rather small screen 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.239
 Well, the first thing he does is hinder 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.310
 minimize if it 's so important from 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.720
 after is the case in 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.300
 following 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 with him with the mouse with which he loses 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 you already point to the click there where 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 the doll is going to walk 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.420
 there it looks like that because it does not load very well 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.069
 we say good I'm going to explain 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.760
 what is this game about 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.099
 his character has to before another person 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.769
 the same in this case I have to go from 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.769
 angel I give you click on the angel 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.140
 and she's already going to give him what he has to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.450
 do you for example here give a 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.640
 objective if she says she needs the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.980
 help in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.470
 that we need help and explains and a 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.720
 little of good things the case is that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.220
 they have to give to accept to accept 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.220
 that you are going to be the mission 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.650
 good when you already maximize not 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.450
 they can chat they can not talk nor 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.250
 send clear message that this ends very 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.480
 little the message that is sent not that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.670
 it's nothing 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.970
 it is not communication with other 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 people very little good you are worth 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.150
 give the angel to you gave them the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.430
 objective yes where it appears where they have 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 to go here on the right side of your 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.200
 screen computer shows this 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.200
 if wherever it shines more 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.040
 If I'm bad, it's not going to come out 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.000
 arrow the indicator but but she 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 I solve that 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.360
 to see see see see 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.810
 good again 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.490
 well here on the right side of the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.940
 look, it appeared that one says 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.940

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.760

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.300
 yellow letters that she herself is going to 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.300

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.570
 once fast and to get that look 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 that the electric marillac was changed to 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.650
 what changed 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.429

 the since she has to get back to herself 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.289
 enough already if you can do it if 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.389

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.459

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.949
 is going to give him to accept that is about 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.529

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.680
 Look, you can see them 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.990

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.840
 I explained so that he will get everything 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.730
 so you do not have to be made 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.620
 win that one by one 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.630
 ready already grabbed her and now they go back to 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.880

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.550
 that goes through and and so they will happen in 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.350
 all the game yes 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.830
 Now let's see what they are all 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.030
 these little things 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.030
 this world here 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.420
 this world is says the world map in 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.480
 right side 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.320
 of your screen says world map is 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.320
 the one that is here 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.310
 that is for you who do like this 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.010
 it's a small world but later 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.820
 they are going to be bigger if you 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.920
 example is here 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.320
 and you will give here that 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.390
 you want to enter here you click and 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.900
 she will automatically be for that part 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:46.550
 later on you will understand that 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.830
 ready this ojito so that's for 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.449
 so that the people who are playing 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.999
 there you can not see 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.360
 and see that they all disappeared and if 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.879
 you sink it 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.020
 they come back and they appear like this is how I pay for 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.789
 I like both the good ways and here 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.490
 there is the button to maximize the screen 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.379
 ready that's all if they have apart 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.719
 concerns or something is if not that 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.760
 I got scorched and subscribed to me in his message 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:14.620
 that I answer 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.160
 the most immediate way what 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.560
 they need help or whatever they want 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.090
 I can collaborate is what I put a lot 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.490
 careful the game and that is very very 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:28.569
 interesting very elegant and patience 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.270
 but very good is that friends 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:34.349
