00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.590 
the pig nose that was the only switch
there<00:02:08.770> was<00:02:08.920> no<00:02:09.100> volume<00:02:09.460> not<00:02:09.970> they<00:02:10.179> will<00:02:10.300> lose

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
there was no volume not they will lose

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.460 
there was no volume not they will lose
on/off<00:02:11.110> volume<00:02:11.740> no<00:02:12.250> tone<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.900> know<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
on/off volume no tone you know now that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.230 
on/off volume no tone you know now that
stuff<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.680> vox<00:02:18.040> da<00:02:19.000> 5<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:21.240> just

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
stuff not like my vox da 5 which is just

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.230 
stuff not like my vox da 5 which is just
a<00:02:22.480> little<00:02:22.840> bit<00:02:22.960> bigger<00:02:23.550> also<00:02:24.550> runs<00:02:24.880> on

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
a little bit bigger also runs on

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.720 
a little bit bigger also runs on
batteries<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:28.300> think<00:02:28.930> it's<00:02:29.080> for<00:02:29.430> SI<00:02:30.430> size

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
batteries I think it's for SI size

batteries I think it's for SI size
batteries<00:02:31.480> uh<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.150> got<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.870> gain<00:02:35.740> tone

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
