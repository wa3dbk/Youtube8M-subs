hi<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.740> name<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:01.949> John<00:00:02.190> hey<00:00:02.850> I'm<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
hi my name is John hey I'm the

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.579 
hi my name is John hey I'm the
first-team<00:00:04.890> 1100<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:06.029> we're<00:00:06.779> here<00:00:06.990> for

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
first-team 1100 and we're here for

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.470 
first-team 1100 and we're here for
robotics<00:00:08.220> explain<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.150> our<00:00:09.210> first

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
robotics explain and this is our first

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
robotics explain and this is our first
video<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.170> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> talk<00:00:10.530> about<00:00:10.590> what

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
video so we want to talk about what

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.709 
video so we want to talk about what
exactly<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> robot<00:00:14.420> well<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:15.690> people

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
exactly is a robot well when people

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
exactly is a robot well when people
think<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> robots<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> pop<00:00:17.340> culture

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
think of robots the thing of pop culture

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.420 
think of robots the thing of pop culture
robots<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.300> r2d2<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.439> or<00:00:20.480> transphobic<00:00:21.480> robot

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
robots like r2d2 or or transphobic robot

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
robots like r2d2 or or transphobic robot
yes<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:24.119> transformers<00:00:24.869> people<00:00:25.380> love

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
yes or transformers people love

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.359 
yes or transformers people love
transformers

transformers

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
transformers
however<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.420> robot<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> also<00:00:28.470> other<00:00:28.710> things

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
however a robot is also other things

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
however a robot is also other things
like<00:00:29.279> robots<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.150> put<00:00:30.330> together<00:00:30.449> cars<00:00:30.869> on

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like robots that put together cars on

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470 
like robots that put together cars on

does not actually have a brain inside of
the<00:00:58.890> brain<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> computer<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the brain is really a computer a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260 
the brain is really a computer a
computer<00:01:01.530> inside<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> robot<00:01:02.550> tells<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.059> what

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
computer inside the robot tells it what

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.560 
computer inside the robot tells it what
to<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.260> input<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.309> uses<00:01:05.909> sensors<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to do with the input it uses sensors and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
to do with the input it uses sensors and
the<00:01:07.049> controller<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.920> process<00:01:08.340> information

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the controller to process information

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.300 
the controller to process information
and<00:01:08.909> output<00:01:09.450> information<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.070> type<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and output information so the type of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.359 
and output information so the type of
sensors<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.090> sort<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.049> have

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
sensors are sort of like what we have

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
sensors are sort of like what we have
sort<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.640> exactly<00:01:15.180> there's<00:01:15.420> sort<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sort of like exactly there's sort of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.940 
sort of like exactly there's sort of
like<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> they're<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.500> exactly

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
like what we have they're not exactly

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
like what we have they're not exactly
like<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> eyes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
like what we have they don't have eyes

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
like what we have they don't have eyes
and<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> nose<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.070> cameras<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and a nose they have cameras and like

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.649 
and a nose they have cameras and like
touch<00:01:21.869> sensors<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.439> something<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
touch sensors and something like that

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
touch sensors and something like that
what<00:01:24.659> these<00:01:24.869> sensors<00:01:25.229> allow<00:01:25.439> them<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
what these sensors allow them to do is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
what these sensors allow them to do is
it<00:01:26.220> allows<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.580> robot<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> tell<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.540> its

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it allows the robot to tell what its

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
it allows the robot to tell what its
surroundings<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.590> tell<00:01:28.770> what's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
surroundings are you can tell what's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.399 
surroundings are you can tell what's
around<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> interact<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.960> thusly

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
around it and interact with it thusly

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.060 
around it and interact with it thusly
the<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> controls<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> robot<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> either

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the the controls of the robot can either

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
the the controls of the robot can either
be<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> computer<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.150> from<00:01:36.299> joysticks<00:01:36.840> or

somebody to tell it what to do it can do
it<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.530> its<00:02:01.799> own<00:02:01.950> robots<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.090> functions<00:02:03.509> like

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it on its own robots have functions like

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.899 
it on its own robots have functions like
that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
that

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.910 
that
where<00:02:04.030> they<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.869> things<00:02:05.049> autonomously<00:02:05.679> or

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
where they can do things autonomously or

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.040 
where they can do things autonomously or
at<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.789> same<00:02:06.999> time<00:02:07.210> they<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.569> take<00:02:07.719> input

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
at the same time they can take input

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.680 
at the same time they can take input
from<00:02:08.080> our<00:02:08.410> computer<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.879> so<00:02:10.149> thanks<00:02:10.599> for

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
from our computer and so thanks for

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.080 
from our computer and so thanks for
turning<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.549> I'm<00:02:13.920> sure<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.250> was<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> wonderful

turning in I'm sure this was a wonderful
talk<00:02:16.269> about<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.900> buzzes<00:02:17.530> thanks<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.370> tuning

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
talk about the buzzes thanks for tuning

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.319 
talk about the buzzes thanks for tuning
in<00:02:18.730> today<00:02:18.819> catch<00:02:19.239> us<00:02:19.360> next<00:02:19.480> time<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.870> robotics
