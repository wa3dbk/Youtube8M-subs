just<00:01:15.240> singing<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> guitar<00:01:15.780> playing<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just singing and guitar playing so that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
just singing and guitar playing so that
gave<00:01:17.880> me<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.120> very<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:19.200> look<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.620> how<00:01:19.980> he

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so in some ways the song really ain't

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
so in some ways the song really ain't
that<00:01:26.130> hard<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.640> capable<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> fifth<00:01:27.390> fret

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
major just four five chords strumming it

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.149
