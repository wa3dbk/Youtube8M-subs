00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.169
 yes 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 Welcome to the saints to your channel 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 blond fountain today we're going to have in the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.850
 channel the first tutorial of the creator of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.099
 contents in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.730
 make ramps in your careers as 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.980
 which I also do in mine 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.070
 and this trevor is badly damaged 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.120
 is placed here is on vacation in 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.010
 this hotel of the saints 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.770
 and well let's go to the creator of 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.110
 content as they taught a few techniques 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.390
 so you can do those ramps that are 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.060
 I was counting and if you like this guy 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 of videos so I'll do another other videos 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.739
 related to the subject as per 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.470
 example put grills in the air we 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.610
 We are going to be online creator, let's be 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.970
 in story mode like I am now 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.530
 same also in online mode 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.120
 once we are 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 we just have to put create 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.480
 career 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 if we want to go to a specific place 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.570
 and I wanted to airport for trevor 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.309
 we are going to be x 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.110
 and when we are in place with the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.120
 we give you 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.340
 in the xa through and we are already in the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.610
 clover airport place 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.070
 this is where we're going to see the tutorial if 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.480
 we give the select you know that we can 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.010
 put with the car or the motorcycle what 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.470
 we have chosen on the bicycle what 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.000
 we can get in even in then 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.650
 under bridges to put points of 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.290
 control if we can also change the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.780
 type of car and use your dog 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.470
 use bikes to know if with the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.020
 jumps as they arrive are well done 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.910
 the crashes or whatever, we're going with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 the first type of ramp we will use 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.850
 a small ramp and we will use 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.290
 several types of techniques the first 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.350
 technique is that of the electrical panel the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.540
 place on the top of the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.550
 ramp and we give it to the right x right 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.850
 a x right x and we will cheat the machine 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.920
 and the second is to use the camera and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.340
 put it on the ground and then give it 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 down and we will get the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.250
 third is with the signal to the right 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.520
 and then turn to the left towards 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.790
 where we have the ramps cheating the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.740
 machine and we can put the ramp right 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.750
 on top of this other 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.930
 it costs a bit more to do it with the signal 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 but it is quite recommendable because in 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.010
 inclination is very high as it works 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.349
 very well 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.879
 continued creating this ramp that are 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.310
 pretty easy to do even though 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.900
 principle always costs a little but you 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.819
 I ask a little patience that you will see that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.819
 you can be amazing races 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.900
 let's try the ramp to see how 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.850
 It seems that luxury comes not 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.160
 it goes quite high we can support it in the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.720
 building where we want good the second 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.850
 type of ramp that I wanted to show you this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.130
 which is a rather more straight ramp that 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.140
 it does not elevate us so much 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.710
 pretty close to the ramps as you see 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.700
 we use large ramps and blocks of 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.270
 floatation 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.720
 well we hit pretty much as we can 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.720
 well stuck 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.960
 because in let's say 6 enough and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 we can put a ramp over 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.069
 then we will erase and that's it 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.000
 if you want to paste more blocks of 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.250
 you can do it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.020
 because right next to the article 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.620
 which is next to much smaller and 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.540
 you can cheat here too 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.129
 good for the object to be solid 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.930
 we will always have to take it with the 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.250
 X from the ground or put it in the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.260
 floor and catch it again with the X 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.060
 so that the object can be placed on top 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.659
 of the flotation blocks in this case 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.659
 the ramp does not 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.500
 or in this case this ramp also and you 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.000
 I gave the X to be solid if 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.560
 I could not put it on top of the other 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.720
 blanket as you see seen is this is the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.090
 third type of ramp which are two ramps 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.709
 large one on top of the other the only 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.900
 way to put a ramp on top of another 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.180
 great in that way 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.190
 putting it with the camera that I can 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.810
 put down when I turn it down and 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.359
 blank lan lan there is 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.520
 as you see a ramp that only with three already 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.450
 it rises quite high 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.110
 and we already have three types of rounds 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.630
 the curve the straight and this one that comes to 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.480
 then it can be one that is done 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.570
 much easier but it is a little 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.250
 flatter like me that is worse because 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.630
 They are slightly apart and sometimes as 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.400
 they are not quite right with 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.050
 large ramps as I already tell you from 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.080
 come out here likar fuck again so that 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.220
 be solid 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.220
 I will be leaving here 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.490
 here for later and I'm going to put another 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.440
 white container next door 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 in emperor and another over 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.330
 always look on the side so you can see 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.470
 before erasing as the draft 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.659
 directly because I know it looks good 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.659
 and we already have four types of branches 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.500
 let's go for the fifth type of ramp that 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.060
 It is made with containers and sacks of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.210
 cement we put it exactly in the 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.740
 bottom end of a large ramp and it 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.980
 embedded in the ground as you can see 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.980
 continuation 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.569
 and what we have to put the panel 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.380
 electric inside the green container 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:40.260
 try to put a ramp 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.080
 there is perfect, we take the sack of 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.540
 cement and place it on the tip of 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.060
 up the ramp 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.740
 we put a green container and we have 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.340
 We can do a double ramp if 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.340
 we want also 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.770
 and that's where we want to continue this 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.889
 ramp as the inclination is no longer going to 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.289
 let put 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.879
 this accessory that is the electrical panel 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.710
 we're going to have to keep doing it with 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.439
 electrical signals in signals towards the 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.360
 right putting the ramp and then 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.580
 putting a green container in the 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.129
 floor and putting it right there on the ramp 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.069
 it's already good we're going to teach you how to do 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:23.740
 the ramp that I use in flying blond in 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.590
 blond crisis are ramps to climb to 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.229
 very high places and that are ramps that are 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.749
 they are floating in the air as you see 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.999
 this ramp I'm doing everything with 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:37.169
 electrical panels because to me 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.169
 it is much easier 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.889
 there are people who will find it easier 

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:43.229
 another technique and what we have to 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.269
 get the panel straight and 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.399
 put a ramp there do not worry 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:49.609
 because we're just going to erase now and this 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.609
 as well 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.900
 ok then we have a hole 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.460
 perfect for this other ramp to arrive 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.229
 and so we can do all the ramps that 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.759
 we want until we run out of 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.180
 accessories you already know we have a 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.650
 limit of 50 accessories in each race 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.660
 once we exceed the limit of 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.850
 50 accessories we have another 10 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.310
 accessories but they are called dynamic and 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.850
 we can also use them as elements 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.850
 of the career 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.930
 when we have the ramp 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.710
 it's perfect here we have all the 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:31.500
 types of ramps that good that I know 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.030
 I hope you like the video if I receive 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.390
 many lay people and I tell you that I will continue 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.730
 putting tutorials of the creator 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.630
 thank you very much for watching the video and we 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.630
 we see in the saints
