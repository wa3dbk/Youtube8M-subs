00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 we are in the company avis auto and as I understand it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 did I today we just hit that 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.509
 the moment you unstick the car 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.300
 athermal film suntek 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.640
 I pay attention to this new 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.079
 young american company and so 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.019
 I understand only from America come 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.519
 long about my 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 he would like to remind you about the flow 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.300
 thermal film quality athermal 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 suntek film first 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.920
 characterized by very low transmission 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.920
 ultraviolet rays and solar 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 sun heat rays in the salon what what 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 guarantees us a comfortable ride torpedo 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.829
 will stop heating so much and this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.649
 correspondingly less work 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.679
 air conditioner that in the face less consumption 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.260
 gasoline we have again two kinds 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.269
 film is an American film 3m and here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.799
 Now Santa in St. we are now looking 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.259
 on the car and still here what 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.590
 The nuances of this particular film 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.360
 compared with the 3m film is first 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.469
 all I want to say when installing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.229
 films we start with glass molding with 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.270
 film forming under our glass and film 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.479
 suntek is different because its very 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.189
 well and quickly can be molded 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.299
 glass indicating high 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.909
 quality materials 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.399
 besides this the film is very good 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.130
 heats it stretches and gives in 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.130
 Easy to form even the most difficult glass 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.549
 can i say that if the film 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 suntek 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.899
 possesses such qualities she and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.180
 much easier to install on 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 cars as opposed to film 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.240
 3m who have the same qualities 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.030
 by the author 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.759
 yes spheres then the next question is if she 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.549
 stops fast does it affect 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.439
 for later for further service well I 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.039
 I mean peeling 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.220
 under the glass first, the manufacturer gives 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.979
 guarantee that the film will not 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.280
 exfoliate will perform its 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.890
 functions for 10 years and its 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.080
 queue we give warranty on installation 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.600
 that the film will not be a hundred times 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.560
 famous to be accustomed will hold on 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.870
 glass also here paid attention through 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.489
 the button is on top of the windshield 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.739
 it speaks about what and when and because 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.200
 we will glue on top three already 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.569
 glued from the inside there is no film 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.489
 dubbing is glued from the inside it's just 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.450
 the first stage of sticking which he 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.569
 spoke molding master attached glass 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 film form glass and inside it then 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.970
 its glue sum up this topic 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.609
 if we want to protect your car 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.730
 from the sun especially with the coming summer 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.620
 we have an alternative quite right 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.950
 it or 3m crystalline 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.799
 or in santek both manufacturers from 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.880
 united states of america both can 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.489
 to demonstrate 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.549
 You can compare although their quality 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.870
 almost the same but all the nuances 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.560
 about the installation 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.540
 polyurethane film is already on us 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.459
 about avis auto 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.980
 it is reliable protection of body parts 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.640

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.730
 presents conceptually new film 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.040
 to protect plastic parts 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.590
 car from mechanical damage and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.870
 scuffed and transparent and thermal 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.180
 film and tinted glass which 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.480
 protects the cabin from overheating in the summer and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.380
 can significantly reduce the time 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.530
 use of air conditioner 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.390
