00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
there's still a lot of paperwork in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.709

computer<00:01:26.280> charting<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.969> some<00:01:27.179> of<00:01:27.299> those<00:01:27.420> kind

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
computer charting in some of those kind

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.749 
computer charting in some of those kind
of<00:01:27.780> things<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.170> documentation<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.399> is<00:01:29.609> not

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
of things the documentation it is not

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.080 
of things the documentation it is not
documented<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.479> wasn't<00:01:30.780> done<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.880> mantra

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
documented it wasn't done is the mantra

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
documented it wasn't done is the mantra
