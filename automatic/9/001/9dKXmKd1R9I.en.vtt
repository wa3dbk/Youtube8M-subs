00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.550

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.550

 Sifting in the flour 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.510
 and then we are going to put 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.710
 The rhythms 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.710
 we will put the water 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.220
 Oil 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.210

 and the salt 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.660
 and we started to pass 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 I always start with a spoon 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 wood with a wooden stick and then already 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.369
 We will put hands when we see and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.760
 there is a solid mass 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.760
 attracted by hand 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.000
 once it came off all transparent 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.410
 tree 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.410
 our sea is taking shape 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 and now to take the volcano out of the world and 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.670
 to the senate 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.100
 when we already have it like this more or less 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.690
 worked 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.690
 let's let her spend a little while 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.330
 cover with a cloth 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.120
 we have let our dough rest 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 57 minutes and now what are we going to do 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.700
 It is a rectangle using a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700
 colour 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.799
 if you see that you have a hard time stretching it 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.469
 we can let it rest a little 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.840
 we will put a little oil on 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.569
 rookie baking can be these 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 flat or what you have for the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.360
 oven 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.240
 it is indifferent 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.520
 what we have to do is cut the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.220
 that we are more or less the same 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.290
 to make a picture then with this base what 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.470
 let's take advantage 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.600
 we will do more after 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.600
 so and so 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.530
 and now more or less 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.530
 of a finger 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 we count 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.100
 we will pass them to the can 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.100
 how much care they stick 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.400
 we see ourselves putting in a can leaving 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.160
 a little bit of separation 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.910
 so that it does not stick 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.950
 with the dough that you have given us 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.580
 now we make the bar again 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.580
 we have done before 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:01.970
 we will let it rest about five or seven 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.970
 more minutes for the rest of puppies 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.090
 we are going to paint them with the key 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.410
 we will cut ourselves a piece that goes 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.260
 overrun 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.810
 so that all are more or less equal 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.590
 of lengths and finally we will put 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.140
 emmental cheese above not much are 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.440
 some brushstrokes so that we do not have the 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.800
 cheese in the silver that would burn 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.040
 we try with the finger is to approximate the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.040
 cheese to the bars to the palotes 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.020
 we have preheated the oven to 200 degrees 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.040
 we will run 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.650
 and we will go down to 180 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.460
 first we will meet a rat 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.460
 and wake up 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.640
 to bake 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.569
 we have had our flexible 15 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.559
 minutes 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.559
 Inside the oven 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.460
 finally for the view 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.910
 now we will let them cool they do not have 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.110
 to be your nation you know 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.110

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.940
 well friends of these divisible serve 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.360
 very good for an appetizer or for half 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.439
 late for when you want 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.439
 let's try the 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.050
 crunchy 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.080
