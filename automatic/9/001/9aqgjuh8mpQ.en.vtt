the<00:04:12.240> next<00:04:12.420> part<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.900> guess<00:04:13.230> we're<00:04:13.470> gonna<00:04:13.530> be

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
the next part I guess we're gonna be

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.130 
the next part I guess we're gonna be
taking<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.490> visit<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.060> beaver<00:04:15.570> dude<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
taking a visit to that beaver dude and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.800 
taking a visit to that beaver dude and
making<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.500> guitar<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.540> wouldn't<00:04:18.720> make

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
making a guitar but that wouldn't make

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.479 
making a guitar but that wouldn't make
much<00:04:19.019> sense<00:04:19.230> because<00:04:19.680> prepa<00:04:20.010> doesn't<00:04:20.340> play

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
much sense because prepa doesn't play

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.760 
much sense because prepa doesn't play
guitar<00:04:20.880> but<00:04:21.329> nothing<00:04:21.900> has<00:04:22.109> made<00:04:22.290> sense<00:04:22.560> up<00:04:22.710> to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
guitar but nothing has made sense up to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.990 
guitar but nothing has made sense up to
this<00:04:22.860> point<00:04:23.040> so<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.280> don't<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.550> why<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.760> would

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
this point so I don't see why it would

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.840 
this point so I don't see why it would
start<00:04:24.690> next<00:04:25.050> time<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.500> guess<00:04:26.160> we'll<00:04:26.310> see<00:04:26.430> see

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
start next time I guess we'll see see

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:50.830
