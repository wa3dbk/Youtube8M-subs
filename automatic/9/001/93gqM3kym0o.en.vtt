00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Platinum 5000 now this is their new week

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.339 
Platinum 5000 now this is their new week
a<00:00:08.790> little<00:00:09.059> bit<00:00:09.240> different<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:09.660> last<00:00:09.929> season

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
a little bit different from last season

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.530 
a little bit different from last season
it's<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.559> really<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.099> nice<00:00:11.340> stick<00:00:11.730> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
it's a really really nice stick you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.759 
it's a really really nice stick you
certainly<00:00:12.870> wouldn't<00:00:13.080> call<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.500> lie

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
certainly wouldn't call this a lie

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.560 
certainly wouldn't call this a lie
middle<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> slightly<00:00:15.030> lower<00:00:15.450> than

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
middle but it is slightly lower than

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.150 
middle but it is slightly lower than
most<00:00:15.809> your<00:00:16.020> standard<00:00:16.410> middle<00:00:16.590> bats<00:00:16.890> going

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
most your standard middle bats going

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.310 
most your standard middle bats going
around<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.850> maybe<00:00:18.570> if<00:00:18.750> you're<00:00:18.840> an<00:00:18.960> opening

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
around so maybe if you're an opening

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.679 
around so maybe if you're an opening
batsman<00:00:19.740> you're<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> front<00:00:20.340> foot<00:00:20.689> you

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
batsman you're on the front foot you

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.689 
batsman you're on the front foot you
want<00:00:21.840> something<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.279> good<00:00:23.460> bat

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
want something with a very good bat

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
want something with a very good bat
speed<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.660> might<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.410> want<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
speed this might be one that you want to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519 
speed this might be one that you want to
look<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.460> changes<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:28.170> fairly

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
look at now the changes are fairly

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
look at now the changes are fairly
minimal<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:29.039> last<00:00:29.220> season<00:00:29.640> she<00:00:29.760> got<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> nice

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
minimal from last season she got a nice

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
minimal from last season she got a nice
tapered<00:00:30.869> toe<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.320> edges<00:00:31.650> are<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:31.859> bit

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
tapered toe the edges are a little bit

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.139 
tapered toe the edges are a little bit
rounder<00:00:32.460> than<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:32.820> used<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> seeing

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
rounder than what we're used to seeing

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.299 
rounder than what we're used to seeing
which<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.510> probably<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:33.989> thing<00:00:34.309> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
which is probably a good thing it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.620 
which is probably a good thing it's
going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.059> durable<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
going to be a little bit more durable a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to be a little bit more durable a
little<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:36.930> less<00:00:37.079> cracking<00:00:37.969> but<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.360> very

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
little bit less cracking but a very very

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.410 
little bit less cracking but a very very
long<00:00:39.840> spoiler<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.410> extends<00:00:41.070> throughout<00:00:41.420> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
long spoiler that extends throughout the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
long spoiler that extends throughout the
blade<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> bat<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> lead

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
blade of the bat so that's going to lead

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610 
blade of the bat so that's going to lead
to<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.360> larger<00:00:45.750> middle<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.140> well

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to a a larger middle as well

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
to a a larger middle as well
we<00:00:47.280> used<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> seeing<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> flashy<00:00:48.149> stickers<00:00:48.600> on

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
we used to seeing the flashy stickers on

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
we used to seeing the flashy stickers on
PMA<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> nice<00:00:49.530> groups<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.370> hasn't

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
PMA and the nice groups that hasn't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
PMA and the nice groups that hasn't
changed<00:00:50.760> either<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.079> Platinum<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
changed either now the Platinum is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
that they're going to call the Platinum
Edition<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.390> fairly<00:01:06.630> similar<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
Edition now this is fairly similar to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
Edition now this is fairly similar to
the<00:01:07.290> rest<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.220> models<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> 5000

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the rest of the the models on the 5000

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
the rest of the the models on the 5000
3000<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> much<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:12.000> grade<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
3000 but it is a much better grade of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
3000 but it is a much better grade of
timber<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.229> fuller<00:01:13.439> profile<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
timber it's a much fuller profile and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
timber it's a much fuller profile and
that's<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.450> better

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that's what you get with your better

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.359 
that's what you get with your better
bats<00:01:16.369> more<00:01:17.369> timber<00:01:17.640> bigger<00:01:18.360> middle<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.369> she's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
bats more timber bigger middle and she's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.530 
bats more timber bigger middle and she's
going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> rock<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.240> soon<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
going to rock it off it as soon as you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
going to rock it off it as soon as you
hit<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.830> couple<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.220> features<00:01:23.430> of
