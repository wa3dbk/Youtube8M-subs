00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
episode for arrow and I liked the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
episode for arrow and I liked the
episode<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.260> guess<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.160> bit<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
episode I guess it was a little bit of a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
episode I guess it was a little bit of a
slower<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.570> surprised<00:00:34.230> by

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
slower one which I was surprised by

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
slower one which I was surprised by
because<00:00:35.100> season<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.030> has<00:00:36.059> been<00:00:36.180> such<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> quick

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
because season two has been such a quick

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
because season two has been such a quick
every<00:00:37.739> episode<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.280> awesome<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.450> get

Thea even if he is has a minute
character<00:01:50.790> I've<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.479> enjoyed<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

character I've really enjoyed this
season<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.950> has<00:01:53.100> grown<00:01:54.530> because<00:01:55.530> she's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
season i think has grown because she's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
season i think has grown because she's
been<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> into<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> vigilante<00:01:57.119> stuff<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
been going into the vigilante stuff and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
been going into the vigilante stuff and
really<00:01:57.600> accepting<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.829> doesn't<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.310> think

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
really accepting it it doesn't I think

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
really accepting it it doesn't I think
Roy<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.850> scared<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.600> won't<00:02:00.869> accept

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
Roy is scared that they won't accept

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.660 
Roy is scared that they won't accept
that<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.619> super<00:02:01.920> strength<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.579> he

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that he has super strength and then he

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.740 
that he has super strength and then he
could<00:02:02.820> heal<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> doesn't<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.600> know

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
could heal and doesn't really know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
could heal and doesn't really know
what's<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> it

the review up humming gums blow what you

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.120 
the review up humming gums blow what you
thought<00:05:25.479> do<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.750> think<00:05:25.900> is<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> mediocre<00:05:26.710> up<00:05:26.949> so

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
thought do you think is a mediocre up so

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.950 
thought do you think is a mediocre up so
like<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.460> did<00:05:27.699> at<00:05:27.789> least<00:05:27.909> for<00:05:28.150> season<00:05:28.449> two<00:05:28.659> I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
like I did at least for season two I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.270 
like I did at least for season two I
think<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:29.440> was<00:05:29.620> definitely<00:05:29.800> one<00:05:30.009> of<00:05:30.130> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
think this was definitely one of the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.070 
think this was definitely one of the
definitely<00:05:31.150> one<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.419> weaker<00:05:31.659> episodes

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
definitely one of the weaker episodes

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.390 
definitely one of the weaker episodes
for<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.289> season<00:05:32.590> probably<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:33.009> weakest

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
for the season probably the weakest

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.210 
for the season probably the weakest
which<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.090> really<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.389> shame<00:05:34.659> to<00:05:35.199> see<00:05:35.349> that<00:05:35.530> as<00:05:35.800> a

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
which is really a shame to see that as a

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.640 
which is really a shame to see that as a
midseason<00:05:36.669> return<00:05:36.940> was<00:05:37.810> very<00:05:37.990> upset<00:05:38.289> by<00:05:38.470> that

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
midseason return was very upset by that
