00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
Dumbledore's wand which I just have
off-camera<00:01:52.130> was<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> longest<00:01:53.700> wand<00:01:54.439> in<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
off-camera was the longest wand in the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.929 
off-camera was the longest wand in the
series<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.630> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> put<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> next<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
series but when you put this next to

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:07.199 
series but when you put this next to
Dumbledore's<00:01:59.939> wand<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.210> bigger

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209

it gets just a bit not maybe a quarter
of<00:02:11.810> an<00:02:11.900> inch<00:02:11.989> an<00:02:12.470> eighth<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.709> an<00:02:13.099> inch
