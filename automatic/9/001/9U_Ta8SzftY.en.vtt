00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it just to again they weren't ranked as

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.300 
it just to again they weren't ranked as
having<00:05:02.780> infernos<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.010> war<00:05:04.190> they

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
having infernos but in the war they

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.159 
having infernos but in the war they
actually<00:05:04.639> get<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.850> benefit<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.990> my

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
actually get the benefit of it in my

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.050 
actually get the benefit of it in my
opinion<00:05:06.199> that's<00:05:06.740> not<00:05:06.949> that's<00:05:07.280> not<00:05:07.520> fair<00:05:07.729> play

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
opinion that's not that's not fair play

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.270 
opinion that's not that's not fair play
that's<00:05:08.330> pretty<00:05:08.600> weak<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:09.169> don't<00:05:09.979> I<00:05:10.160> don't

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
that's pretty weak I don't I don't

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.430 
that's pretty weak I don't I don't
believe<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.940> career<00:05:11.330> townhall<00:05:11.870> 8<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.410> a

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
believe in career townhall 8 and a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.390 
believe in career townhall 8 and a
half's<00:05:12.560> 9<00:05:12.889> and<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.099> half's

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
half's 9 and a half's

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.900 
half's 9 and a half's
I<00:05:13.490> think<00:05:14.000> it's<00:05:14.180> fine<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.870> use<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.250> time

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
I think it's fine to use it as a time

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.810 
I think it's fine to use it as a time
for<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.930> get<00:05:18.110> your<00:05:18.410> offense<00:05:18.800> built<00:05:19.190> up<00:05:19.370> to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
for you to get your offense built up to

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.159 
for you to get your offense built up to
where<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.210> still<00:05:20.419> be<00:05:20.539> an<00:05:20.630> asset<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:21.050> your

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
where you can still be an asset to your

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.219 
where you can still be an asset to your
clan<00:05:21.699> not<00:05:22.699> just<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.060> jump<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.509> and<00:05:23.900> grab<00:05:23.990> those

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
clan not just to jump in and grab those

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.650 
clan not just to jump in and grab those
infernal<00:05:24.500> towers<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.039> that<00:05:25.130> extra<00:05:25.370> Expo<00:05:25.849> when

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
infernal towers and that extra Expo when

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.480 
infernal towers and that extra Expo when
you<00:05:26.810> are<00:05:27.169> capable<00:05:27.440> of<00:05:27.740> taking<00:05:27.919> those<00:05:28.220> things

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
you are capable of taking those things

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.120 
you are capable of taking those things
out<00:05:28.699> it<00:05:28.970> so<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:29.840> think<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.320> aspect<00:05:30.770> of<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:30.979> is

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
out it so I think that aspect of it is

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.710 
out it so I think that aspect of it is
fine<00:05:31.340> but<00:05:31.550> again<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.060> anything<00:05:32.330> like<00:05:32.479> that

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
fine but again it in anything like that

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.390 
fine but again it in anything like that
there's<00:05:32.870> always<00:05:33.020> abuse<00:05:33.590> there's<00:05:34.250> always

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
there's always abuse there's always

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.010 
there's always abuse there's always
people<00:05:34.639> they're<00:05:34.910> going<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.120> take<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.510> out<00:05:35.630> one

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
people they're going to take it out one

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.589 
people they're going to take it out one
step<00:05:36.289> further<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.830> make<00:05:37.729> something<00:05:38.360> up

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
step further and make something up

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.250 
step further and make something up
something<00:05:39.260> bad<00:05:39.650> out<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:39.979> it<00:05:40.130> so<00:05:40.870> just<00:05:41.870> again

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
something bad out of it so just again
