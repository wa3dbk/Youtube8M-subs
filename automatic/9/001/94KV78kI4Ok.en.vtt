 of the traffickers to extra 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.899
 this last recipe is super delicious 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.610
 but above all super easy and I think that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.680
 It is ideal for those people in a way 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.140
 type of work they have not had time to 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.180
 prepare something here very elaborate but 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.630
 that the truth want to surprise this 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 so special person about what delicious 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.280
 but let's see the recipe 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.039
 for this recipe we are going to need 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.250
 cottage cheese or ricotta without salt and if it is 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.520
 possible 0% sugar farm matter 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.310
 panela cheese light cream stevia in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 dust and a company for the base of the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.250
 dessert we will use biscuits from 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.250
 soletilla or lady fingers milk and cinnamon 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 We started crushing the cottage cheese 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.520
 low speed to give it a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 cream consistency remember that if you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 put at full speed it will become 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 liquid if we do not want that once we 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.509
 we have a creamy texture we add the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.730
 hysteria powder sugar and cheese 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.920
 cream 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.130
 we continue beating with rods 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.820
 until you get a homogeneous cream 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.820
 we booked in the fridge 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 now let's prepare the base of the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.099
 dessert 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.530
 we mix the law is together with the cinnamon 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.450
 I love cinnamon and so I 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.930
 I put so much was a matter of taste 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.540
 mix very well I have used these 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.609
 biscuits because each one contributes only 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.590
 30 calories so they are perfect 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.959
 for the recipe 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.210
 in another video I hope to show you how 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.100
 do the integral version 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.590
 what we will do next is 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.670
 just soak the biscuits in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.040
 the milk for each cup I use 3 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.780
 we continue placing a sauce 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
 strawberries that I have only known 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.120
 crushing the strawberries with a little 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.700
 honey 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.099
 To decorate we put the cream cheese 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.140
 in a bag and cut one of the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.140
 corners to make it easier 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.510
 now if we put a dam or a 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.530
 Heart shaped jelly to give 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.859

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.659
