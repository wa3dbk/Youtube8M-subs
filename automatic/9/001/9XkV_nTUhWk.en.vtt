the pong design and you know what the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
the pong design and you know what the
case<00:01:47.130> fills<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.729> saw<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> really

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
case fills really saw it's a really

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.399 
case fills really saw it's a really
solid<00:01:49.470> feeling<00:01:49.860> case<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.869> one<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
solid feeling case and one one of the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
solid feeling case and one one of the
things<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> pong<00:01:53.729> said<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> case<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
things that pong said about the case is

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.990 
things that pong said about the case is
that<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.960> fits<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.740> Galaxy<00:01:56.340> Nexus<00:01:57.469> verizon

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that it fits on the Galaxy Nexus verizon

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.940 
that it fits on the Galaxy Nexus verizon
version<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.170> extended<00:02:01.500> battery<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
version with the extended battery so I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.139 
version with the extended battery so I
went<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.310> purchase<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> extended<00:02:02.909> battery

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
went on purchase the extended battery

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.719 
went on purchase the extended battery
and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.469> would<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> phone<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and you would just put the phone in the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.359 
and you would just put the phone in the
case<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:07.439> let's<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:07.979> even<00:02:08.190> do

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
case like so let's see if I can even do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.220 
case like so let's see if I can even do
a<00:02:08.399> one-handed<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.929> isn't<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
a one-handed because this isn't like the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.899 
a one-handed because this isn't like the
his<00:02:11.349> case<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.280> off<00:02:12.340> believe<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:12.879> or

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
his case to get on and off believe it or

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.309 
his case to get on and off believe it or
not<00:02:13.000> once<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.360> get<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.690> there<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.050> not

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
not once you get it on there it's not

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.680 
not once you get it on there it's not
too<00:02:14.590> easy<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.069> off<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.480> pretty

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
too easy to go off but you just pretty

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.680 
too easy to go off but you just pretty
much<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:16.959> push<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.260> down<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:17.980> snaps<00:02:18.340> on

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
much just push it down and it snaps on

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.500 
much just push it down and it snaps on
see<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.900> down<00:02:20.379> there<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.830> their<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.730> their<00:02:21.790> on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
see it down there on their on their on

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.380 
see it down there on their on their on
their<00:02:22.569> good<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.760> see<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.180> pretty

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
their good as you can see it's a pretty

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.990 
their good as you can see it's a pretty
tight<00:02:25.659> fit<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.110> sides<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.549> tight<00:02:27.790> so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
tight fit on the sides it's a tight so

don't fit on the sides there and it does
actually<00:02:30.069> appear<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.819> well<00:02:31.060> crafted<00:02:31.420> for

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230

life now once again i'm not sure if it

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.960 
life now once again i'm not sure if it
was<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.139> update<00:04:30.560> or<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.010> case<00:04:31.370> because<00:04:31.700> they

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
was the update or the case because they

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.080 
was the update or the case because they
actually<00:04:32.120> came<00:04:32.630> at<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> same<00:04:33.139> time<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.440> got<00:04:33.740> so

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
actually came at the same time I got so

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.129 
actually came at the same time I got so
disappointed<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.210> my<00:04:35.240> battery<00:04:35.540> was<00:04:35.870> only

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
disappointed that my battery was only

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.780 
disappointed that my battery was only
lasting<00:04:36.590> little<00:04:37.400> less<00:04:37.580> than<00:04:37.760> 12<00:04:38.000> hours<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.840> I

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
lasting little less than 12 hours so I

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.629 
lasting little less than 12 hours so I
got<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.970> update<00:04:41.740> now<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.040> already<00:04:43.220> had<00:04:43.490> the

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
got the update now I already had the

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.300 
got the update now I already had the
extended<00:04:44.630> battery<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.960> good<00:04:45.200> two<00:04:45.620> three<00:04:45.650> weeks

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
extended battery a good two three weeks

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.280 
extended battery a good two three weeks
before<00:04:46.639> then<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:47.060> wasn't<00:04:47.330> seeing<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.900> much<00:04:48.139> of

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
before then I wasn't seeing that much of

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.340 
before then I wasn't seeing that much of
an<00:04:48.380> increase<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.770> battery<00:04:49.700> life<00:04:49.880> but<00:04:50.810> after<00:04:51.320> I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
an increase of battery life but after I

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.490 
an increase of battery life but after I
got<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.710> case<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.400> was<00:04:52.940> within<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.540> day<00:04:53.780> or<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:53.990> I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
got the case it was within a day or so I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.190

high<00:04:55.130> already<00:04:55.520> had<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.910> update<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.479> I<00:04:56.510> really

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200

didn't<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.500> much<00:04:57.850> time<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:59.060> test<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.510> out<00:04:59.600> but

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
didn't have much time to test it out but

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.250 
didn't have much time to test it out but
I<00:04:59.900> will<00:05:00.139> say<00:05:00.380> my<00:05:00.740> battery<00:05:01.300> will<00:05:02.300> go<00:05:02.600> for<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.050> good

other<00:05:19.250> stuff<00:05:19.540> if<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:20.720> shut<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.020> off<00:05:21.139> at<00:05:21.290> night

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
other stuff if you shut it off at night

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.540 
other stuff if you shut it off at night
now<00:05:21.590> if<00:05:21.680> you<00:05:21.740> don't<00:05:21.830> shut<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:22.160> off<00:05:22.250> at<00:05:22.400> night

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
now if you don't shut it off at night

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.920 
now if you don't shut it off at night
you<00:05:22.700> probably<00:05:22.850> won't<00:05:23.180> get<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.479> but<00:05:23.660> i<00:05:23.690> will

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
you probably won't get that but i will

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.080 
you probably won't get that but i will
say<00:05:24.200> i<00:05:24.410> definitely<00:05:25.220> had<00:05:25.340> an<00:05:25.490> increase<00:05:25.880> in

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
say i definitely had an increase in

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.330 
say i definitely had an increase in
battery<00:05:26.720> life<00:05:27.110> with<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.470> case<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:27.950> i<00:05:27.979> would

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
battery life with the case so i would

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.909 
battery life with the case so i would
definitely<00:05:28.370> recommend<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.330> pong<00:05:29.539> case<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.530> is

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
definitely recommend the pong case it is

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.640 
definitely recommend the pong case it is
a<00:05:30.950> really<00:05:31.430> really<00:05:31.580> steep<00:05:32.150> price<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.870> pay<00:05:33.410> now

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
a really really steep price to pay now

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.610 
a really really steep price to pay now
it<00:05:33.950> does<00:05:34.160> come<00:05:34.430> in<00:05:34.580> really<00:05:34.880> nice<00:05:35.620> packaging

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
it does come in really nice packaging

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.090 
it does come in really nice packaging
and<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.280> nice<00:05:37.700> little<00:05:37.990> custom<00:05:38.990> fit<00:05:39.350> box<00:05:39.740> that's

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
and a nice little custom fit box that's

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.370 
and a nice little custom fit box that's
so<00:05:40.419> sleek<00:05:41.419> it's<00:05:42.289> very<00:05:42.620> very<00:05:42.950> sleek<00:05:44.050> nice<00:05:45.050> it's

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
so sleek it's very very sleek nice it's

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.170 
so sleek it's very very sleek nice it's
very<00:05:45.440> well<00:05:45.770> packaged<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.550> obviously<00:05:47.000> the

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
very well packaged and obviously the

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.270 
very well packaged and obviously the
case<00:05:47.390> itself<00:05:47.750> is<00:05:47.960> very<00:05:48.020> well<00:05:48.380> styled<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.919> it

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
case itself is very well styled and it

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.500 
case itself is very well styled and it
makes<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.550> feel<00:05:49.700> like<00:05:49.760> a<00:05:49.910> premium<00:05:50.330> foam

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
makes it feel like a premium foam

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.330 
makes it feel like a premium foam
because<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:51.229> Galaxy<00:05:51.620> Nexus<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.039> a<00:05:52.070> little<00:05:52.250> bit

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
because the Galaxy Nexus is a little bit

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.890 
because the Galaxy Nexus is a little bit
of<00:05:52.430> a<00:05:52.490> plastic<00:05:52.700> feeling<00:05:53.210> but<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.479> case

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
of a plastic feeling but the case

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.420 
of a plastic feeling but the case
actually<00:05:54.169> makes<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:54.620> feel<00:05:54.950> like<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.190> much

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
actually makes it feel like a much

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.029 
actually makes it feel like a much
better<00:05:55.460> more<00:05:56.180> expensive<00:05:56.780> device<00:05:57.590> because

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
better more expensive device because

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.129 
better more expensive device because
it's<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:58.340> custom<00:05:58.850> fit<00:05:59.120> to<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.450> and<00:05:59.570> it's<00:05:59.750> such<00:06:00.110> a

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
it's so custom fit to it and it's such a

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.029 
it's so custom fit to it and it's such a
solid<00:06:00.650> case<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:01.910> would<00:06:02.210> recommend<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.780> case

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
solid case so I would recommend the case

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.460 
solid case so I would recommend the case
but<00:06:04.039> it<00:06:04.190> is<00:06:04.340> sixty<00:06:04.700> dollars<00:06:05.200> that's<00:06:06.200> one<00:06:06.380> of

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
but it is sixty dollars that's one of

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.719 
but it is sixty dollars that's one of
the<00:06:06.530> down<00:06:06.680> for<00:06:06.919> it<00:06:07.100> falls<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.580> is<00:06:07.700> a

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
the down for it falls it is a

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.790 
the down for it falls it is a
sixty-dollar<00:06:08.210> case<00:06:08.539> if<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:09.320> want<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.590> spend

sixty-dollar case if you want to spend

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.520 
sixty-dollar case if you want to spend
60<00:06:10.130> bucks<00:06:10.310> on<00:06:10.460> a<00:06:10.490> case<00:06:10.700> you<00:06:10.850> can<00:06:11.289> it<00:06:12.289> will

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
60 bucks on a case you can it will

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.580 
60 bucks on a case you can it will
increase<00:06:13.039> your<00:06:13.070> battery<00:06:13.580> life<00:06:14.050> from<00:06:15.050> my<00:06:15.289> own

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.379 
increase your battery life from my own
testing<00:06:16.190> i<00:06:16.280> would<00:06:16.460> say<00:06:16.639> it<00:06:16.760> will<00:06:16.940> I<00:06:17.150> don't<00:06:17.330> know

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
testing i would say it will I don't know

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.510 
testing i would say it will I don't know
really<00:06:17.660> about<00:06:17.900> how<00:06:18.139> much<00:06:18.410> but<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.740> did<00:06:19.250> see<00:06:19.430> an

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
really about how much but I did see an

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.480 
really about how much but I did see an
increase<00:06:19.850> in<00:06:19.880> battery<00:06:20.150> life<00:06:20.510> and<00:06:21.370> will<00:06:22.370> it

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
increase in battery life and will it

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.550 
increase in battery life and will it
protect<00:06:22.639> your<00:06:22.910> head<00:06:23.000> from<00:06:23.030> radiation<00:06:23.479> yes<00:06:23.870> now

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
protect your head from radiation yes now

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.100 
protect your head from radiation yes now
the<00:06:24.620> thing<00:06:25.130> is<00:06:25.160> most<00:06:25.520> people<00:06:25.669> say<00:06:26.180> not<00:06:26.900> most

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
the thing is most people say not most

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.930 
the thing is most people say not most
people<00:06:27.470> but<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.740> FCC<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.250> right<00:06:28.460> saying<00:06:28.729> right

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
people but the FCC is right saying right

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.520 
people but the FCC is right saying right
now<00:06:28.970> is<00:06:29.210> that<00:06:29.360> radiation<00:06:29.990> doesn't<00:06:30.289> cause<00:06:30.500> any

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
now is that radiation doesn't cause any

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.680 
now is that radiation doesn't cause any
harm<00:06:30.860> to<00:06:30.950> your<00:06:31.099> brain<00:06:31.310> but<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:32.390> know<00:06:32.510> what

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
harm to your brain but you know what

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.120 
harm to your brain but you know what
it's<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.110> same<00:06:33.289> radiation<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.860> they<00:06:33.979> use<00:06:34.099> in

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
it's the same radiation that they use in

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.679 
it's the same radiation that they use in
microwaves<00:06:34.669> and

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689 
microwaves and

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:36.909 
microwaves and
I don't<00:06:36.049> want<00:06:36.169> to<00:06:36.229> hold<00:06:36.289> the<00:06:36.409> microwave<00:06:36.709> in<00:06:36.860> my

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
I don't want to hold the microwave in my

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.919 
I don't want to hold the microwave in my
head<00:06:37.099> when<00:06:37.219> I<00:06:37.249> when<00:06:37.789> I<00:06:37.849> talk<00:06:38.059> so<00:06:38.269> I<00:06:38.599> would

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:38.929 
head when I when I talk so I would

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:40.570 
head when I when I talk so I would
definitely<00:06:38.959> recommend<00:06:39.319> it<00:06:39.739> if<00:06:39.889> you<00:06:40.009> feel<00:06:40.249> that

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
definitely recommend it if you feel that

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.449 
definitely recommend it if you feel that
the<00:06:41.509> FCC<00:06:41.689> is<00:06:42.169> being<00:06:42.499> a<00:06:42.709> little<00:06:42.889> bitch<00:06:43.129> and<00:06:43.339> not

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:43.459 
the FCC is being a little bitch and not

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.179 
the FCC is being a little bitch and not
telling<00:06:43.729> you<00:06:43.849> the<00:06:43.939> truth<00:06:44.149> about<00:06:44.299> the<00:06:44.599> possible

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189
