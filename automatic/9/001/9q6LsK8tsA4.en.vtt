 Playstation 4 designed works 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 but also with a few small tricks on 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.080
 pc priced is the airforce p12 he am 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 favorable area 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.710
 It costs about 60 euros at Amazon 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.590
 Who is this cheap option for 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.870
 recommended and broadly 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.200
 the airforce p12 is completely aimed 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.420
 to the playstation 4 community man notices 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.690
 also it is completely geared up for it 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 the function eg the voice chat or the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.150
 voice commands at the playstation 4 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.460
 work great not only that 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.920
 but that he's using 12 points for speed 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.920
 Full volume crystal clear check 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.590
 about usb and powerful bass that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 airforce p12 is definitely not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.360
 Lightweight It is great with good 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 padded earcups with one 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 firm and stable strap 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.409
 but not necessarily small 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.110
 is the wearing comfort nevertheless optimal 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.540
 even with longer battles one has 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.030
 The feeling as if you were not at all 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.019
 headset on it does not express it is 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.599
 not too heavy 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.840
 in principle, you could even the whole 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.500
 play by night 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.519
 The microphone is indeed stuck with the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.379
 connected headset but thanks 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.379
 flexible material perfect in front of the 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.450
 own mouth will be placed and will 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.470
 The microphone can not be used 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.420
 you just fold it backwards 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.760
 There is a small regulator 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.510
 which is firmly connected to the cable 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.950
 how to adjust the volume and the bass 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.840
 and turn off can be this feature 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.730
 Although simple and very comfortable 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.569
 nevertheless it happens from summer on that one 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.360
 be of the game action in the rush 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.879
 that the volume is not quiet 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.160
 but the regulator turns on loud 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:12.970
 very sensitive to touch 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.940
