altogether depending on the type of am

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
altogether depending on the type of am
that<00:01:11.670> you've<00:01:11.820> got<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.840> quite<00:01:13.110> multi<00:01:13.590> practical

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that you've got be quite multi practical

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
that you've got be quite multi practical

they'll do a lot of different types of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.160 
they'll do a lot of different types of
vans<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.270> wouldn't<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.930> being<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
vans so we wouldn't see there being a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
vans so we wouldn't see there being a
major<00:01:19.350> problem<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.910> would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
major problem there and what you would

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780 
major problem there and what you would
do<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> bolt<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.050> through<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.340> pop<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
do is you bolt that through you pop this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 
do is you bolt that through you pop this
right<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.510> door<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.010> then<00:01:26.010> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
right through the door and then you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.410 
right through the door and then you
would<00:01:26.250> both<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.970> sorry<00:01:27.660> whoops

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
would both up then sorry whoops

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.970 
would both up then sorry whoops
you<00:01:30.420> lock<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> skin<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
you lock that then to the skin off the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.220 
you lock that then to the skin off the
actual<00:01:32.370> door<00:01:32.610> itself<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.600> similar<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> that

one<00:01:34.440> as<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> idea<00:01:36.830> such<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.860> simple

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
one as well and the idea such a simple

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.000 
one as well and the idea such a simple
one<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.910> unique<00:01:41.690> comes<00:01:42.690> with<00:01:42.900> three<00:01:43.530> P's<00:01:43.800> our

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
one on unique comes with three P's our

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.860 
one on unique comes with three P's our
standard<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.550> lock<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.660> two

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
standard is this would then lock the two

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.840 
standard is this would then lock the two
halves<00:01:49.170> together

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.760 

like<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.540> can<00:01:56.780> imagine<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.380> now

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
like so so you can imagine that now

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.610 
like so so you can imagine that now
being<00:01:58.490> secured<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.230> what<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> would

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
being secured and that's what it would

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.460 
being secured and that's what it would
look<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:00.830> from<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.400> outside<00:02:02.470> absolutely
