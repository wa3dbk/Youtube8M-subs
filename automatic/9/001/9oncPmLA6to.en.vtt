all righty so I have all the screws up
bolts<00:00:03.650> and<00:00:04.759> this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.359> other<00:00:06.870> side<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
bolts and this is the other side this is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.580 
bolts and this is the other side this is
gonna<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> passenger<00:00:08.490> side<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.500> when<00:00:10.500> the

manual tells you just for reference this
is<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.470> considered<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.270> side

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
is going to be considered the right side

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.640 
is going to be considered the right side
this<00:00:19.740> will<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.430> considered<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.939> left<00:00:21.300> side

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
this will be considered the left side

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.750 
this will be considered the left side
when<00:00:22.650> you're<00:00:22.769> looking<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> though<00:00:23.580> it's

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
when you're looking at it though it's

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810 
when you're looking at it though it's
opposite<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.800> just<00:00:25.800> say<00:00:26.010> passenger<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:26.789> driver

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
opposite I just say passenger or driver

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
opposite I just say passenger or driver
because<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.930> makes<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.730> easier<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.920> like

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
because it makes it easier so just like

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
because it makes it easier so just like
the<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.899> cover<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.469> gonna<00:00:36.020> head<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> off

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the last cover we're gonna head it off

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.639 
the last cover we're gonna head it off
camera<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:40.620> pull<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:45.379> break<00:00:46.379> that

seal once again this bracket here is in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
seal once again this bracket here is in
the<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.940> again<00:01:08.659> gonna<00:01:09.659> force<00:01:10.020> anything

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

this<00:01:11.010> bracket<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.090> came<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this bracket the other one came off I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
this bracket the other one came off I
taped<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.380> them<00:01:13.549> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> board<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
taped it on them on the board but this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
taped it on them on the board but this
one<00:01:15.930> stays<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.890> wiring<00:01:17.100> harness<00:01:17.610> because

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
one stays on the wiring harness because

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.399 
one stays on the wiring harness because
there's<00:01:18.390> no<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.200> able<00:01:19.229> to

harnesses<00:01:22.950> pushpin<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:24.409> once<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> push

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
harnesses pushpin thing once you push

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.870 
harnesses pushpin thing once you push
them<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.400> never<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.759> enough<00:01:27.799> see<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
issues again with the wiring harness so

issues again with the wiring harness so
if<00:01:39.210> you're<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> point<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.380> back<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
if you're to this point your back is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
get the sealant off with the razor blade

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
get the sealant off with the razor blade
and<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.950> blade<00:01:53.399> you're<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.060> need<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and this blade you're gonna need one of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810 
and this blade you're gonna need one of
these<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.170> exactly<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> need<00:01:56.219> as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you can turn it like that and get that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can turn it like that and get that
angle<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.939> can't<00:02:00.210> gouge<00:02:00.570> anything<00:02:01.409> as

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
angle and you can't gouge anything as

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.469 
angle and you can't gouge anything as
well<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.030> can't<00:02:03.329> let<00:02:03.570> anything<00:02:03.960> fall<00:02:05.479> like

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
well you can't let anything fall like

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.529 
well you can't let anything fall like
there<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.350> pretty<00:02:07.710> much<00:02:07.799> like

there was you know pretty much like
right<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.050> corner<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.250> some

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
right on that corner like there was some

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.460 
right on that corner like there was some
sealant<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> seeped<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.569> there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
sealant that seeped in there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.230 
sealant that seeped in there
you<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.830> corner<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.090> to
