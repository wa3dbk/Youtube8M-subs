on target yeah yeah the way I look at it
Ryan<00:03:46.019> trigger<00:03:46.799> control<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.760> weapon<00:03:48.329> control

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
Ryan trigger control is weapon control

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.090 
Ryan trigger control is weapon control
and<00:03:48.989> let<00:03:49.230> me<00:03:49.350> make<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.650> little<00:03:49.680> bit<00:03:49.950> more

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and let me make it a little bit more

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.129 
and let me make it a little bit more
specific<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.910> lot<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.720> people<00:03:51.989> don't

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
specific a lot of people don't

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.150 
specific a lot of people don't
understand<00:03:52.620> trajectory<00:03:54.410> 1/16<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.739> inch<00:03:55.889> of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
understand trajectory 1/16 of an inch of

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.470 
understand trajectory 1/16 of an inch of
muzzle<00:03:56.639> movement<00:03:57.329> at<00:03:57.780> 20<00:03:58.260> feet<00:03:59.120> translates<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
muzzle movement at 20 feet translates to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.030 
muzzle movement at 20 feet translates to
a<00:04:00.510> Miss<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.139> point<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.500> aim<00:04:01.650> point<00:04:01.889> of

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
a Miss of the point of aim point of

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.940 
a Miss of the point of aim point of
impact<00:04:02.459> by<00:04:02.700> four<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.450> half<00:04:03.480> inches<00:04:04.139> okay

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
impact by four and a half inches okay

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.349 
impact by four and a half inches okay
well<00:04:05.190> maybe<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.519> should<00:04:05.670> put<00:04:05.850> some<00:04:05.880> rounds<00:04:06.120> on

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
well maybe we should put some rounds on

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.000 
well maybe we should put some rounds on
target<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.930> kind<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.380> see<00:04:07.530> what<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.769> looks

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
target and kind of see what that looks
