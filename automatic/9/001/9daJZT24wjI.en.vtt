premature but I guess yet and like bad
other<00:02:06.620> cart<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.160> he<00:02:07.340> didn't<00:02:07.520> really<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
other cart so he didn't really have a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.820 
other cart so he didn't really have a
choice<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.750> he<00:02:08.810> wants<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.170> keep<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.350> fantasy
