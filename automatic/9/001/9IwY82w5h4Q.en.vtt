the<00:02:31.000> head<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.480> bottom<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.590> first<00:02:32.890> thing<00:02:33.040> we're

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
the head and bottom so first thing we're

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.610 
the head and bottom so first thing we're
going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.939> are<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:34.569> sew<00:02:34.900> this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
going to do is we are going to sew this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.970 
going to do is we are going to sew this
top<00:02:36.040> triangle<00:02:36.939> top<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.900> top<00:02:38.260> triangle

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.119 

all<00:02:44.980> right<00:02:45.129> so<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.459> should<00:02:45.670> end<00:02:45.879> up<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.269> that

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
all right so it should end up like that

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.500 
all right so it should end up like that
now<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.640> important

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
now this is important

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.959 
now this is important
trust<00:02:49.840> me<00:02:49.959> outlets<00:02:50.290> or<00:02:50.469> hard<00:02:50.680> way<00:02:50.879> before<00:02:51.879> you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
trust me outlets or hard way before you

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.720 
trust me outlets or hard way before you
so<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.329> other<00:02:52.510> head<00:02:52.829> let's<00:02:53.829> match<00:02:54.069> them<00:02:54.280> up<00:02:54.400> so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
so the other head let's match them up so

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.819 
so the other head let's match them up so
that<00:02:54.939> we<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.420> mouthpieces<00:02:56.260> together

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
that we have the mouthpieces together

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.309 
that we have the mouthpieces together
now<00:02:57.819> remembering<00:02:58.329> that<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.659> sown<00:02:58.900> part<00:02:59.200> is

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
now remembering that the sown part is

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.479 
now remembering that the sown part is
always<00:02:59.530> going<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.799> in<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> inside<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
always going to be in the inside of the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.339 
always going to be in the inside of the
puppet<00:03:00.849> so<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:01.569> going<00:03:01.659> to<00:03:01.720> be<00:03:01.840> important<00:03:02.260> and

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
puppet so it's going to be important and

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.119 
puppet so it's going to be important and
we<00:03:02.439> match<00:03:02.650> up<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.980> head<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.189> then<00:03:05.129> you're

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
we match up the head and then you're

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.740 
we match up the head and then you're
going<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> sew<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.579> in<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.909> inside<00:03:07.299> imagine

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
going to sew it in the inside imagine

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.479 
going to sew it in the inside imagine
this<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:08.019> all<00:03:08.170> sewn<00:03:08.409> together<00:03:08.680> you're<00:03:09.400> going

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
this is all sewn together you're going

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.920 
this is all sewn together you're going
to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.639> something<00:03:09.970> inside<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.870> know

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
to be something inside so then I know

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.629 
to be something inside so then I know
that<00:03:11.319> our<00:03:11.469> triangle<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.010> going<00:03:12.219> to<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.459> like

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
that our triangle is going to be like

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.940 
that our triangle is going to be like
this<00:03:12.969> fold<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.959> towards<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.290> inside<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.769> so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
this fold it towards the inside and so

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.949 
this fold it towards the inside and so
that<00:03:15.159> top<00:03:15.879> part

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.539 

now<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.500> we<00:03:21.620> saw<00:03:21.799> on<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.920> top<00:03:22.159> triangle

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
now that we saw on the top triangle

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.970 
now that we saw on the top triangle
parts<00:03:22.909> let's<00:03:23.780> make<00:03:23.989> sure<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.319> we<00:03:24.500> didn't<00:03:24.769> sew

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
parts let's make sure that we didn't sew

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.820 
parts let's make sure that we didn't sew
them<00:03:25.190> backwards<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.330> again<00:03:26.599> putting<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.620> two

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
them backwards so again putting the two

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.330 
them backwards so again putting the two
seams<00:03:28.159> together<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:30.049> seems<00:03:30.349> inside<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:31.129> head

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
seams together it seems inside the head

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.460 
seams together it seems inside the head
your<00:03:32.150> should<00:03:32.450> still<00:03:32.750> be<00:03:32.930> matching<00:03:33.349> your

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
your should still be matching your

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.890 
your should still be matching your
puppet<00:03:33.830> like<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.670> next<00:03:34.940> part<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.870> are

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
puppet like so the next part we are

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.289 
puppet like so the next part we are
going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.620> reverse<00:03:37.040> these<00:03:37.340> pups<00:03:37.790> let's<00:03:38.120> put

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
going to reverse these pups let's put

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.600 
going to reverse these pups let's put
