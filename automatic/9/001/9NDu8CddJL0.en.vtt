00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.970 
me and I should have died but instead
I'm<00:02:45.810> able<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.320> right<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:46.680> because

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
I'm able to get right back up because

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
I'm able to get right back up because
the<00:02:47.220> special<00:02:47.430> ability<00:02:47.910> killed<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.300> person

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the special ability killed that person

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
the special ability killed that person
back<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.170> killed<00:02:49.440> multiple<00:02:49.800> people

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
back and then killed multiple people

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650 
back and then killed multiple people
like<00:02:50.310> instead<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.910> getting<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.209> death<00:02:51.420> I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
like instead of just getting a death I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
like instead of just getting a death I
add<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.860> my<00:02:53.010> score<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.580> end<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.300> getting<00:02:54.450> right

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
add to my score I end up getting right

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.300 
add to my score I end up getting right
back<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.230> killing<00:02:55.500> off<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.830> five<00:02:56.040> people

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
back up and killing off like five people

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.949 
back up and killing off like five people
so<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:56.850> would<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.090> been<00:02:57.239> one<00:02:57.450> death<00:02:57.660> form<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
so what would have been one death form a

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.540 
so what would have been one death form a
turns<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.530> plus<00:02:58.709> five<00:02:58.980> kills<00:02:59.310> with

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
turns out to be plus five kills with

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.370 
turns out to be plus five kills with
zero<00:02:59.760> deaths<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:01.080> way<00:03:01.320> too

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
zero deaths like it's it's way too

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.320 
zero deaths like it's it's way too
powerful<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.100> my<00:03:02.220> own<00:03:02.370> opinion<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.090> very

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
powerful in my own opinion it's very

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.540 
powerful in my own opinion it's very
annoying<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.810> go<00:03:03.959> against<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> by<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.100> way<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
annoying to go against and by the way so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.949 
annoying to go against and by the way so
I<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.000> ridiculously<00:03:06.690> powerful

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
I think it's ridiculously powerful

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.960 
I think it's ridiculously powerful
because<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.920> possible<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.670> shoot

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
because is possible if you shoot

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
because is possible if you shoot
somebody<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.570> see<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> big<00:03:10.019> smoke<00:03:10.260> come<00:03:10.380> out

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
somebody you see the big smoke come out

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.110 
somebody you see the big smoke come out
you<00:03:10.650> understand<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.280> they're<00:03:11.400> using<00:03:11.580> reject

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you understand that they're using reject

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.670 
you understand that they're using reject
that<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.630> wait<00:03:12.750> while<00:03:12.989> they<00:03:13.140> decided

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that you have to wait while they decided

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.750 
that you have to wait while they decided
whether<00:03:13.830> or<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.010> they're<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.430> revive

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
whether or not they're going to revive

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.070 
whether or not they're going to revive
themselves<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.390> they<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.570> they're<00:03:15.900> pretty

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
themselves if they do they're pretty

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.420 
themselves if they do they're pretty
easy<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.440> kill<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> be<00:03:16.830> perfect

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
easy to kill to be perfect

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.830 
easy to kill to be perfect
I'll<00:03:17.519> admit<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.850> they're<00:03:18.150> very<00:03:18.360> easy<00:03:18.600> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
I'll admit that they're very easy to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080 
I'll admit that they're very easy to
kill<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.829> an<00:03:19.920> annoyance<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.700> super

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
kill but it's an annoyance it's a super

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.850 
kill but it's an annoyance it's a super
annoying<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:21.750> very<00:03:21.930> similar<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> last<00:03:22.560> stain

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
it is instead of making some you're

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.090 
it is instead of making some you're
invincible<00:05:25.350> while<00:05:25.770> you're<00:05:25.919> down<00:05:26.040> there

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
invincible while you're down there

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.290 
invincible while you're down there
deciding<00:05:26.580> whether<00:05:26.729> or<00:05:26.790> not<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:26.940> revive

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
deciding whether or not to revive

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.760 
deciding whether or not to revive
yourself<00:05:27.450> making<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.050> people<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.410> shoot<00:05:28.590> you

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
yourself making so people can shoot you

yourself making so people can shoot you
but<00:05:28.889> at<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.190> point<00:05:29.490> it's<00:05:30.090> essentially<00:05:30.720> just

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
but at that point it's essentially just

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.260 
but at that point it's essentially just
last<00:05:31.290> stand<00:05:31.620> or<00:05:31.860> maybe<00:05:32.370> even<00:05:32.430> final<00:05:33.030> stands

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
last stand or maybe even final stands

last stand or maybe even final stands
but<00:05:33.510> with<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.630> new<00:05:33.870> smoke<00:05:34.530> effect<00:05:34.890> like<00:05:35.130> it's

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
but with a new smoke effect like it's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.770 
but with a new smoke effect like it's
something<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:36.030> don't<00:05:36.090> think<00:05:36.390> should<00:05:36.510> be<00:05:36.600> in<00:05:36.690> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780
