three I don't know what the deal is with

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.100 
three I don't know what the deal is with
that<00:04:06.000> oh<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.270> guess<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.780> three

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
that oh I guess it's just three

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.750 
that oh I guess it's just three
applications<00:04:07.620> i<00:04:08.070> was<00:04:08.220> i<00:04:08.370> was<00:04:08.460> thinking<00:04:08.700> it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
applications i was i was thinking it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.280 
applications i was i was thinking it
might<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.030> three-step<00:04:09.450> process<00:04:09.600> but<00:04:10.260> i

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
might be a three-step process but i

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.870 
might be a three-step process but i
think<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:10.680> three<00:04:10.950> applications<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.700> that's

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
think it's three applications so that's

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.150 
think it's three applications so that's
pretty<00:04:12.120> cool<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:13.290> says<00:04:13.440> award-winning<00:04:13.890> color

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
pretty cool it says award-winning color

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.670 
pretty cool it says award-winning color
