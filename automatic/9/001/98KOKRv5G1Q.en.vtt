charges the battery and it goes to the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.700 
charges the battery and it goes to the
timer<00:04:21.519> box<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.270> that's<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.990> adjust<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
timer box and that's to adjust the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.900 
timer box and that's to adjust the
nesting<00:04:24.190> box<00:04:24.430> gates<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:25.090> open<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.690> close<00:04:25.960> them

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
nesting box gates to open and close them

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.330 
nesting box gates to open and close them
so<00:04:27.910> birds<00:04:28.540> won't<00:04:28.930> sit<00:04:29.229> in<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> nesting<00:04:29.889> boxes

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
so birds won't sit in the nesting boxes

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.240 
so birds won't sit in the nesting boxes
at<00:04:30.520> night<00:04:31.260> here<00:04:32.260> at<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.919> chicken

Caravan<00:04:33.430> we<00:04:33.880> have<00:04:34.090> another<00:04:34.450> jockey<00:04:34.870> wheel

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229

Caravan we have another jockey wheel
this<00:04:35.889> acts<00:04:36.250> as<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.520> stabilizer<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.350> if<00:04:38.530> you

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
this acts as a stabilizer just so if you

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.500 
this acts as a stabilizer just so if you
walk<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> back<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> chicken<00:04:39.760> Caravan

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
you're not going to tip it up because it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.060 
you're not going to tip it up because it
is<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> smaller<00:04:43.030> model<00:04:43.510> also<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.500> little<00:04:44.950> bit

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070

is a smaller model also in a little bit
of<00:04:45.160> windy<00:04:45.550> conditions<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.300> acts<00:04:46.690> as<00:04:46.960> an<00:04:47.080> extra

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
of windy conditions it acts as an extra

of windy conditions it acts as an extra
stabilizer<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:49.030> reason<00:04:49.510> we've<00:04:49.690> used<00:04:49.990> a

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
stabilizer the reason we've used a

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.920 
stabilizer the reason we've used a
jockey<00:04:50.440> wheel<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:51.039> a<00:04:51.270> jack<00:04:52.270> stand<00:04:52.300> with<00:04:52.900> a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
solid leg is if you don't forget to wind

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.500 
solid leg is if you don't forget to wind
it<00:04:56.289> up<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.740> start<00:04:57.010> moving<00:04:57.310> along<00:04:57.880> you'll

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
it up and you start moving along you'll

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.360 
it up and you start moving along you'll
probably<00:04:58.780> feel<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.380> hit<00:04:59.620> and<00:04:59.830> all<00:04:59.950> just<00:05:00.130> roll

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
probably feel it hit and all just roll

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.879 
probably feel it hit and all just roll
along<00:05:00.580> rather<00:05:01.479> than<00:05:01.780> bending<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.440> leg<00:05:02.650> and

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
along rather than bending a leg and

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.300 
along rather than bending a leg and
doing<00:05:03.130> damage<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.820> unit<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.979> what

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
doing damage to the unit so this is what

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.860 
doing damage to the unit so this is what
it<00:05:06.400> was<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.580> farm<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:07.030> Jericho<00:05:07.539> New<00:05:07.720> South

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
it was to farm in Jericho New South

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.440 
it was to farm in Jericho New South
Wales<00:05:08.139> it's<00:05:08.650> quite<00:05:08.860> hilly<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.030> guess<00:05:10.270> I

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
Wales it's quite hilly and I guess I

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.239 
Wales it's quite hilly and I guess I
wasn't<00:05:10.900> sure<00:05:11.139> about<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.710> chip

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:12.249 
wasn't sure about the chip

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.309 
wasn't sure about the chip
when<00:05:12.579> I<00:05:12.609> first<00:05:12.819> up<00:05:12.999> that<00:05:13.359> wasn't<00:05:13.599> overseen

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
when I first up that wasn't overseen

passively<00:05:14.979> over<00:05:15.339> in<00:05:15.459> you<00:05:15.579> need<00:05:15.759> with<00:05:15.999> these

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:16.179 
passively over in you need with these

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.749 
passively over in you need with these
crazy<00:05:16.599> struts<00:05:17.229> as<00:05:17.529> the<00:05:17.739> rollaway<00:05:18.669> nesting

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759

really well thought out I just I love
the<00:05:28.629> fact<00:05:28.929> that<00:05:28.989> it's<00:05:29.469> cut<00:05:29.709> our<00:05:29.829> egg<00:05:29.979> washing

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
the fact that it's cut our egg washing

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.949 
the fact that it's cut our egg washing
time<00:05:30.519> down<00:05:30.789> enormously<00:05:31.299> so<00:05:31.509> we<00:05:31.599> don't<00:05:31.749> have<00:05:31.869> to

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:31.959 
time down enormously so we don't have to

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.859 
time down enormously so we don't have to
watch<00:05:32.079> it<00:05:32.289> anymore<00:05:32.619> and<00:05:33.389> it's<00:05:34.389> just<00:05:34.599> it's<00:05:34.779> a

watch it anymore and it's just it's a

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.529 
watch it anymore and it's just it's a

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:38.559 
design we love it

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:41.819

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
couple of days and it's just it's so

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.869 
couple of days and it's just it's so
simple<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.439> well-built<00:05:59.860> and<00:06:00.129> it<00:06:00.339> just<00:06:00.579> works

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:00.879 
simple and well-built and it just works

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.509 
simple and well-built and it just works
wonderfully
