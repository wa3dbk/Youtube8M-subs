00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.040 
could get out I was in a very precarious
position<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:55.830> head<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:57.030> down<00:02:57.270> under<00:02:57.300> my<00:02:57.840> right

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
position my head was down under my right

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.100 
position my head was down under my right
thigh<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:59.240> for<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> minute<00:03:00.570> there<00:03:00.780> he<00:03:00.810> thought

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
thigh and for a minute there he thought

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.860 
thigh and for a minute there he thought
possibly<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.370> had<00:03:02.520> been<00:03:02.760> decapitated<00:03:03.060> but

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
possibly that I had been decapitated but

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.500 
possibly that I had been decapitated but
we<00:03:04.710> came<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.430> quite<00:03:05.760> well<00:03:07.100> then<00:03:08.510> when

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
we came out of that quite well then when

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.110 
we came out of that quite well then when
you<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.960> back<00:03:10.350> on<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.100> possibly<00:03:11.490> right

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you think back on it and possibly right

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.950 
you think back on it and possibly right
at<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.420> time<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> crew<00:03:15.300> hadn't

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
at the time that we as a crew hadn't

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.770 
at the time that we as a crew hadn't
really<00:03:16.440> ever<00:03:16.670> volunteered<00:03:17.670> or<00:03:17.940> signed<00:03:18.209> up<00:03:18.510> for

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
really ever volunteered or signed up for

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.430 
really ever volunteered or signed up for
any<00:03:18.959> space<00:03:20.209> exploration<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:22.170> felt

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
any space exploration but it sure felt

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.410 
any space exploration but it sure felt
like<00:03:22.709> somebody<00:03:22.980> fired<00:03:23.459> up<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.850> rockets<00:03:24.270> and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
like somebody fired up the rockets and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.820 
like somebody fired up the rockets and
