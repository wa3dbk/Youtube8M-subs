00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
car today uh I mean we did some running

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
car today uh I mean we did some running
and<00:00:15.199> tried<00:00:16.199> two<00:00:16.859> different<00:00:16.890> tires<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.850> set<00:00:18.390> up

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and tried two different tires and set up

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.250 
and tried two different tires and set up
some<00:00:18.810> pretty<00:00:19.710> normal<00:00:19.949> stuff<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.670> vatsim<00:00:21.260> it

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
some pretty normal stuff on vatsim it

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.470 
some pretty normal stuff on vatsim it
should<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> car<00:00:23.220> well<00:00:23.460> guys<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.240> car

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
should not be the car well guys the car

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
should not be the car well guys the car
but<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> data<00:00:25.199> logging<00:00:25.619> system<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.279> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
but it's the data logging system and we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
but it's the data logging system and we
lose<00:00:26.580> their<00:00:26.849> time<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.449> run<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.960> that's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
lose their time we can run so that's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.250 
lose their time we can run so that's
that's<00:00:28.769> really<00:00:28.920> dimension<00:00:30.140> basically<00:00:31.140> we've

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's really dimension basically we've

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.760 
that's really dimension basically we've
established<00:00:31.650> its<00:00:32.340> quick<00:00:33.290> yeah<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.440> course

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
established its quick yeah of course

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
established its quick yeah of course
it's<00:00:34.980> hard<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> say<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.450> teams

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's hard to say what what other teams

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
it's hard to say what what other teams
are<00:00:36.960> doing<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.410> they're<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.800> happy<00:00:38.160> i<00:00:38.190> was

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
are doing but they're pretty happy i was

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160 
are doing but they're pretty happy i was
there<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.239> issues<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there are some issues that we have to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.700 
there are some issues that we have to
fix<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:42.090> definitely<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.200> faster<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
fix and we can definitely go faster but

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.080 
fix and we can definitely go faster but
i<00:00:44.520> mean<00:00:45.170> not<00:00:46.170> too<00:00:46.410> bad<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> temperatures

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
i mean not too bad with the temperatures

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
i mean not too bad with the temperatures
today<00:00:48.270> being<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.960> cool<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> hard

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
today being a little bit cool is it hard

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.240 
today being a little bit cool is it hard
to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.920> decent<00:00:50.160> our<00:00:50.460> data<00:00:50.730> um<00:00:51.510> well<00:00:52.379> maybe<00:00:52.739> we

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to get decent our data um well maybe we

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
to get decent our data um well maybe we
had<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.699> short<00:00:54.000> runs<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
had to do short runs because the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.119 
had to do short runs because the
problems<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> data<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.489> had<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:58.129> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
problems with the data we had but it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
problems with the data we had but it
wasn't<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.609> bad<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.570> seems

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
wasn't too bad I think this time seems

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
wasn't too bad I think this time seems
to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:02.039> easy<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> work<00:01:02.820> with

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to be a bit more easy to work with

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.870 
to be a bit more easy to work with
Nicole<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> conditions<00:01:04.170> tyndall<00:01:04.500> Oster's<00:01:04.880> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Nicole the conditions tyndall Oster's is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
Nicole the conditions tyndall Oster's is
this<00:01:06.090> circuit<00:01:06.570> overall<00:01:07.080> still<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> good<00:01:07.650> guide

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this circuit overall still a good guide

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
this circuit overall still a good guide
to<00:01:08.159> where<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> first<00:01:09.150> half

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to where you might be in the first half

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.679 
to where you might be in the first half
of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> season<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.159> where<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.549> are

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
of the season I don't know where we are

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.940 
of the season I don't know where we are
in<00:01:12.689> terms<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.020> learning<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> have

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
in terms of learning from what you have

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.210 
in terms of learning from what you have
here<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:15.630> full<00:01:15.840> list<00:01:16.229> by<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.500> hair<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
here for full list by the hair and it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010 
here for full list by the hair and it
was<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.610> her<00:01:17.729> ass<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.330> we're<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.750> race

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
was in her ass because we're gonna race

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.350 
was in her ass because we're gonna race
here<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> definitely<00:01:20.460> gives<00:01:20.850> us<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> good

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
here so it definitely gives us a good

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240 
here so it definitely gives us a good
better<00:01:21.600> idea<00:01:21.990> but

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.530 

usually<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.580> really<00:01:25.820> last<00:01:26.150> year<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:26.509> saw

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
usually it was really last year we saw

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.390 
usually it was really last year we saw
the<00:01:26.750> car<00:01:27.080> was<00:01:27.259> pretty<00:01:27.560> good<00:01:27.680> everywhere<00:01:28.159> i'm

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
the car was pretty good everywhere i'm

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.820 
the car was pretty good everywhere i'm
now<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.970> don't<00:01:29.750> say<00:01:29.869> reason<00:01:30.259> why<00:01:30.380> we<00:01:30.619> couldn't

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
now I don't say reason why we couldn't

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.870 
now I don't say reason why we couldn't
be<00:01:31.180> pretty<00:01:32.180> good<00:01:32.420> over<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.380> car<00:01:33.680> but<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.640> it

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
be pretty good over this car but is it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.600 
be pretty good over this car but is it
good<00:01:35.060> enough<00:01:35.409> nada<00:01:36.409> just<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> final<00:01:37.430> word

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
good enough nada just the final word

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
good enough nada just the final word
this<00:01:37.820> your<00:01:37.939> hunger<00:01:38.360> for<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.659> second<00:01:39.110> title<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
this your hunger for a second title the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.539 
this your hunger for a second title the
same<00:01:39.770> as<00:01:39.920> your<00:01:40.040> hunger<00:01:40.340> was<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> first

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.200 

that's<00:01:46.549> very<00:01:47.240> not<00:01:47.750> okay<00:01:48.670> there<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.820> go<00:01:49.970> I

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's very not okay there you go I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.109 
that's very not okay there you go I
think<00:01:51.049> maybe<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.039> answer<00:01:52.369> itself<00:01:52.729> may<00:01:52.970> be<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
think maybe the answer itself may be a

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.639 
think maybe the answer itself may be a
bit<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.360> disrespect<00:01:53.930> with<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.259> question

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
bit of disrespect with that question

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.710 
bit of disrespect with that question
from<00:01:55.009> kimi<00:01:55.280> raikkonen<00:01:55.759> obviously<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.390> hunger

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
from kimi raikkonen obviously the hunger

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.719 
from kimi raikkonen obviously the hunger
still<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.140> there<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.830> second<00:01:58.280> title<00:01:58.429> well

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
still is there for a second title well
