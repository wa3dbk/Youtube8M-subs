00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.560 
the frame rate and all that stuff so I
think<00:01:44.380> it'll<00:01:44.500> it'll<00:01:44.770> it'll<00:01:45.520> be<00:01:45.670> really<00:01:45.940> work

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
think it'll it'll it'll be really work

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.889 
think it'll it'll it'll be really work
really<00:01:46.720> well<00:01:46.810> here<00:01:47.110> here<00:01:47.860> we<00:01:48.009> go<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:49.270> look

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
really well here here we go now look

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.240 
really well here here we go now look
into<00:01:50.020> my<00:01:50.110> right<00:01:50.350> left<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.740> have<00:01:50.860> no<00:01:50.979> opponents

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
into my right left I have no opponents

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.950 
into my right left I have no opponents
to<00:01:51.610> race<00:01:51.759> with<00:01:51.970> which<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.330> little<00:01:52.479> sad<00:01:52.780> at

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
to race with which is a little sad at

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.010 
to race with which is a little sad at
this<00:01:53.110> stage<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.820> also<00:01:55.210> no<00:01:55.360> jump<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:55.930> you

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
this stage but and also no jump so you

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.130 
this stage but and also no jump so you
can't<00:01:56.229> do<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.470> awesome<00:01:56.920> slide<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.780> we<00:01:58.930> all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
can't do that awesome slide that we all

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.260 
can't do that awesome slide that we all

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
and this is what I remember so as I

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.520 
and this is what I remember so as I
cover<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.720> corner<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.110> will<00:02:17.290> kind<00:02:17.380> of

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
cover on this corner this will kind of

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.190 
cover on this corner this will kind of
show<00:02:17.680> why<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.510> these<00:02:19.630> games<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:20.019> so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
show why you know these games are so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.960 
show why you know these games are so
awesome<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.010> rift<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> mean<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.519> can<00:02:21.670> really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
awesome on the rift I mean I can really

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.020 
awesome on the rift I mean I can really
just<00:02:22.180> look<00:02:22.780> around<00:02:22.989> lean<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:24.610> see<00:02:24.820> where

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
just look around lean really see where

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.660 
just look around lean really see where
my<00:02:25.269> wheels<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.400> don't<00:02:27.549> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
my wheels are now we don't have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.009 
my wheels are now we don't have
positional<00:02:28.150> tracking<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.630> don't<00:02:28.780> know<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:28.930> it's

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
positional tracking I don't know if it's

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.110 
positional tracking I don't know if it's
intended<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.500> sure<00:02:29.680> hope<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.580> course<00:02:30.880> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
intended I sure hope so of course the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
intended I sure hope so of course the
the<00:02:31.420> Crystal<00:02:31.750> Cove<00:02:31.930> version<00:02:32.380> does<00:02:33.040> have

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the Crystal Cove version does have

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.590 
the Crystal Cove version does have
positional<00:02:33.700> tracking<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.269> know<00:02:34.330> we're<00:02:34.570> all

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
positional tracking and I know we're all

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.220 
positional tracking and I know we're all
super<00:02:35.290> stoked<00:02:35.470> about<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:38.080> could

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
super stoked about that but you could

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.259 
super stoked about that but you could
really<00:02:38.380> see<00:02:38.470> why<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.370> these<00:02:39.670> racing

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
really see why you know these racing

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.680 
really see why you know these racing
games<00:02:40.420> are<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:40.720> compelling<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.680> platform

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
games are so compelling on this platform

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.210 
games are so compelling on this platform
to<00:02:43.690> be<00:02:43.870> able<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.230> rip<00:02:44.380> around<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.680> corner<00:02:44.950> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
to be able to rip around a corner and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.789 
to be able to rip around a corner and
actually<00:02:46.060> look<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.720> almost<00:02:47.380> lead<00:02:47.650> yourself

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
actually look and almost lead yourself

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.350 
actually look and almost lead yourself
around<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> corner<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:49.360> really

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
around the corner is really

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.840 
around the corner is really
I<00:02:50.450> mean<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.190> never<00:02:52.190> been<00:02:52.400> possible<00:02:52.580> before

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
I mean it's never been possible before

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.640 
I mean it's never been possible before
so<00:02:53.600> I'm<00:02:53.660> gonna<00:02:53.750> check<00:02:53.900> out<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.140> rear<00:02:54.380> view

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
so I'm gonna check out this rear view

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.020 
so I'm gonna check out this rear view
cam<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> little<00:02:55.280> bit<00:02:55.370> more<00:02:55.520> now<00:02:55.730> when<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.940> look

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
cam a little bit more now when I look

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.450 
cam a little bit more now when I look
down<00:02:56.810> at<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.260> look<00:02:57.410> behind<00:02:57.530> me<00:02:57.860> then

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
down at that and I look behind me then

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.920 
down at that and I look behind me then
quickly<00:02:58.670> before<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.060> slamming<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.540> wall<00:02:59.750> I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
quickly before I slamming this wall I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.470 
quickly before I slamming this wall I
look<00:03:00.080> behind<00:03:00.200> me<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:00.950> they<00:03:01.100> seem<00:03:01.340> pretty

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.150 

yeah<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.690> mean<00:03:07.990> yeah<00:03:08.990> that's<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.500> cool<00:03:09.710> all

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
yeah I mean yeah that's really cool all

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640 
yeah I mean yeah that's really cool all
right<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.400> focusing<00:03:10.820> on<00:03:11.000> Mario's<00:03:11.450> big<00:03:12.140> fat

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
right so focusing on Mario's big fat

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.320 
right so focusing on Mario's big fat
Shahs<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> minute<00:03:13.520> couple<00:03:13.850> things<00:03:14.000> come<00:03:14.210> to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
Shahs for a minute couple things come to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.390 
Shahs for a minute couple things come to
mind<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.020> first<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.980> acts<00:03:16.160> as<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
mind the first is it really acts as a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
mind the first is it really acts as a
bit<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.670> an<00:03:16.760> anchor<00:03:17.090> let<00:03:17.870> me<00:03:17.930> say<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.080> cockpit

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
bit of an anchor let me say a cockpit

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.320 
bit of an anchor let me say a cockpit
game<00:03:18.890> where<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.970> know<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.300> thing

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
game where you have you know one thing

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.730 
game where you have you know one thing
in<00:03:20.630> your<00:03:20.660> field<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.020> view<00:03:21.200> for<00:03:21.350> your<00:03:21.500> eyes<00:03:21.560> to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
in your field of view for your eyes to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.530 
in your field of view for your eyes to
focus<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.370> remains<00:03:22.670> constant<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.390> then

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
focus on there remains constant and then

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.720 
focus on there remains constant and then
the<00:03:23.720> background<00:03:24.140> changes<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.520> think

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
the background changes and I think

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.640 
the background changes and I think
arguably<00:03:25.940> at<00:03:26.209> least<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.570> would<00:03:26.750> lessen<00:03:27.020> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
arguably at least that would lessen the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.320 
arguably at least that would lessen the
likelihood<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:28.100> getting<00:03:28.280> any<00:03:28.550> sort<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.880> nausea

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
likelihood of getting any sort of nausea

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.630 
likelihood of getting any sort of nausea
or<00:03:29.360> VR<00:03:29.630> sickness<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.320> other<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:31.400> just

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
or VR sickness and the other it's just

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
ah so now our typical racing game on a

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.000 
ah so now our typical racing game on a
typical<00:04:38.150> monitor<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.960> mean<00:04:39.410> running<00:04:39.650> into<00:04:39.980> a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
typical monitor I mean running into a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.909 
typical monitor I mean running into a
wall<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.520> an<00:04:40.639> object<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.150> really<00:04:41.419> no<00:04:41.570> big<00:04:41.720> deal

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.290 
wall and an object is really no big deal
this<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.160> actually<00:04:43.580> gives<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.940> little<00:04:44.180> bit

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
this it actually gives you a little bit

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.600 
this it actually gives you a little bit
of<00:04:44.419> hesitation<00:04:45.139> or<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.770> reservation<00:04:46.520> about

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
of hesitation or a reservation about

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.140 
doing it there's something about an
object<00:04:48.440> comments<00:04:49.100> slamming<00:04:49.580> right<00:04:49.790> towards

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
object comments slamming right towards

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.590 
object comments slamming right towards
your<00:04:50.300> eyes<00:04:51.190> it's<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:52.820> weird<00:04:53.120> when<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.480> do

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
so here we are in another track now no

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.780 
so here we are in another track now no
engine<00:05:05.840> sounds<00:05:06.380> here<00:05:06.590> but<00:05:06.889> beyond<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.550> it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
engine sounds here but beyond that it

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.510 
engine sounds here but beyond that it
looks<00:05:08.000> awesome<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.650> these<00:05:12.740> ones<00:05:12.979> have<00:05:13.100> really

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
looks awesome and these ones have really

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.010 
looks awesome and these ones have really
big<00:05:13.700> banking<00:05:14.060> turns<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.510> can<00:05:14.630> really<00:05:14.810> make

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
big banking turns you can really make

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.870 
big banking turns you can really make
use<00:05:15.290> of<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:16.040> know<00:05:16.130> kind<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.460> looking<00:05:16.639> around<00:05:16.700> a

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
use of you know kind of looking around a

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.680 
use of you know kind of looking around a
corner<00:05:17.120> like<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.290> for<00:05:18.650> example<00:05:19.540> now<00:05:20.540> like

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
corner like that for example now like

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.120 
corner like that for example now like
this<00:05:20.870> Ridge<00:05:21.110> here<00:05:21.139> when<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.650> hit<00:05:21.919> it<00:05:22.010> with

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
this Ridge here when you hit it with

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.430 
this Ridge here when you hit it with
your<00:05:22.160> wheels<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.760> actually<00:05:23.180> does<00:05:24.110> kind<00:05:24.410> of

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
your wheels it actually does kind of
