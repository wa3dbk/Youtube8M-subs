00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
him when he does this just keep moving

I<00:04:20.750> recommend<00:04:21.620> coordinating<00:04:22.130> with<00:04:22.250> your<00:04:22.370> team

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
I recommend coordinating with your team

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.129 
I recommend coordinating with your team
so<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:22.910> get<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.180> as<00:04:23.419> spending<00:04:23.780> hits<00:04:23.960> as

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
so you can get in as spending hits as

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.950 
so you can get in as spending hits as
possible<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:26.270> about<00:04:26.479> covers<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.810> for
