my<00:01:49.030> definition<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.540> feminism<00:01:49.870> was<00:01:50.590> any<00:01:51.840> woman

who wanted equality between the sexes
one<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.760> biggest<00:01:57.970> concepts<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.570> learned

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
one of the biggest concepts we learned

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.090 
one of the biggest concepts we learned
in<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.050> class<00:01:59.260> was<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.740> idea<00:01:59.920> of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
in the class was this idea of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.330 
in the class was this idea of
intersectionality<00:02:02.280> intersectionality<00:02:03.280> is

intersectionality intersectionality is

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.550 
intersectionality intersectionality is
the<00:02:03.580> idea<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:03.940> feminism<00:02:04.690> goes<00:02:05.020> beyond<00:02:05.410> just

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the idea that feminism goes beyond just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
the idea that feminism goes beyond just
equality<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.370> women<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:07.720> equality<00:02:08.709> between

equality for women it's equality between
