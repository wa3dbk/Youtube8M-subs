00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
many different variations of this time

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.870 
many different variations of this time
today<00:00:10.950> how<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.370> supposed<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.670> go<00:00:11.759> back

and talk got something to do with

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.720 
and talk got something to do with
traveling<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> speed<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.040> light<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.519> gas

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
traveling at the speed of light or gas

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
traveling at the speed of light or gas
is<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.000> speed<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.330> life<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.809> then<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.020> happens

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is a speed of life so then what happens

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.349 
is a speed of life so then what happens
you<00:00:16.920> could<00:00:17.039> see<00:00:17.220> George<00:00:17.490> Washington<00:00:18.060> living

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
yeah it sounds stupid yes you would you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.990 
yeah it sounds stupid yes you would you
there's<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> particle<00:00:22.320> accelerators<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> they

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
there's a particle accelerators and they

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.950 
there's a particle accelerators and they
they<00:00:24.359> spin<00:00:25.760> particles<00:00:26.760> faster<00:00:27.689> than<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
they spin particles faster than the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
they spin particles faster than the
speed<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> light<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.340> opens<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
speed of light which then opens up a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.500 
speed of light which then opens up a
tunnel<00:00:30.710> which<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.850> through<00:00:33.270> and
