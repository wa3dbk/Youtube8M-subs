Matt from woodworking parts comm here
again<00:00:09.610> with<00:00:10.270> probably<00:00:10.750> one<00:00:11.020> of<00:00:11.050> our<00:00:11.260> most

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.470 
again with probably one of our most

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.779 
again with probably one of our most
confusing<00:00:12.129> and<00:00:12.490> often<00:00:13.559> miss<00:00:14.559> ordered<00:00:15.250> items

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:15.789 
confusing and often miss ordered items

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.680 
confusing and often miss ordered items
the<00:00:16.780> difference<00:00:17.230> between<00:00:17.440> clock<00:00:18.690> movements

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
the difference between clock movements

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.100 
the difference between clock movements
and<00:00:20.400> inserts<00:00:21.400> also<00:00:21.850> called<00:00:22.090> fit<00:00:22.360> ups<00:00:22.510> the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
and inserts also called fit ups the

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.400 
and inserts also called fit ups the
difference<00:00:23.530> is<00:00:23.740> these<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:25.480> movements<00:00:25.990> mount

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
difference is these the movements mount

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.970 
difference is these the movements mount
behind<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:27.160> board<00:00:28.260> through<00:00:29.260> a<00:00:29.320> smaller<00:00:29.650> hole

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
behind a board through a smaller hole

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.369 
behind a board through a smaller hole
and<00:00:30.280> just<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.000> shaft<00:00:31.270> sticks<00:00:31.600> through<00:00:31.840> then

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
and just the shaft sticks through then

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.270 
and just the shaft sticks through then
you<00:00:32.500> mount<00:00:32.649> all<00:00:32.920> your<00:00:33.070> hands<00:00:33.520> on<00:00:33.719> top<00:00:34.719> of<00:00:34.780> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you mount all your hands on top of that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.889 
you mount all your hands on top of that
the<00:00:36.280> inserts<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.679> bigger<00:00:39.309> hole<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.780> the

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
the inserts have a bigger hole and the

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.450 
the inserts have a bigger hole and the
entire<00:00:41.699> movement<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:43.030> encased<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.309> sits<00:00:45.309> in

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
entire movement is encased and sits in

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.799 
entire movement is encased and sits in
the<00:00:45.550> hole<00:00:46.019> so<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.739> problem<00:00:48.159> comes<00:00:48.489> in<00:00:48.809> what

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
the hole so the problem comes in what

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.979 
the hole so the problem comes in what
size<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.530> for<00:00:50.980> what<00:00:51.159> board<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:51.839> what<00:00:52.839> do<00:00:52.929> I

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
size is for what board and what do I

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.160 
size is for what board and what do I
need<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.319> order<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:54.190> for<00:00:54.519> example<00:00:54.969> this<00:00:55.569> is<00:00:55.809> an

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
need to order so for example this is an

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.910 
need to order so for example this is an
inch<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:57.030> 7/16<00:00:58.030> insert<00:00:59.019> which<00:00:59.319> is<00:00:59.499> measured

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
inch and 7/16 insert which is measured

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.939 
inch and 7/16 insert which is measured
from<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.879> outsides<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:01.839> bezel<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.620> bezel

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
from the outsides of the bezel the bezel

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.399 
from the outsides of the bezel the bezel
is<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.399> chrome<00:01:04.269> ring<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.839> outside<00:01:05.140> so

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
is this chrome ring on the outside so

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.060 
is this chrome ring on the outside so
from<00:01:05.620> edge<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.890> edge<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:07.090> an<00:01:07.390> inch<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.070> 7/16

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
from edge to edge is an inch and 7/16

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.880 
from edge to edge is an inch and 7/16
which<00:01:09.729> fits<00:01:10.060> into<00:01:10.509> an<00:01:10.780> inch<00:01:11.619> and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
which fits into an inch and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.690 
which fits into an inch and
three-eighths

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
three-eighths

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.560 
three-eighths
hole<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:15.040> pops<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.549> it's<00:01:15.820> kind<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.180> friction

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
hole it pops in it's kind of a friction

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.539 
hole it pops in it's kind of a friction
fit<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.710> if<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:17.979> drill<00:01:18.189> all<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.430> way<00:01:18.460> through

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
fit so if you drill all the way through

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.149 
fit so if you drill all the way through
you<00:01:18.850> can<00:01:19.000> poke<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.390> back<00:01:19.420> out<00:01:19.780> otherwise<00:01:20.170> you

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
you can poke it back out otherwise you

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.190 
you can poke it back out otherwise you
can<00:01:21.460> just<00:01:21.729> turn<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.030> over<00:01:22.390> whack<00:01:22.719> it<00:01:22.750> against

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
can just turn this over whack it against

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.660 
can just turn this over whack it against
your<00:01:23.289> palm<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.829> will<00:01:23.950> pop<00:01:24.159> back<00:01:24.189> out

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
your palm and it will pop back out

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.090 
your palm and it will pop back out
that's<00:01:25.329> for<00:01:25.719> adjusting<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.409> time<00:01:26.680> changing

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that's for adjusting the time changing

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's for adjusting the time changing
the<00:01:27.189> batteries<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.619> movements<00:01:30.130> are<00:01:30.250> a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
the batteries now the movements are a

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.389 
the batteries now the movements are a
little<00:01:30.909> bit<00:01:31.090> different<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.869> movements<00:01:32.469> this

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
little bit different the movements this

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.359 
little bit different the movements this
happens<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.939> be<00:01:33.969> a<00:01:34.090> seven<00:01:34.509> ace<00:01:34.890> movement<00:01:35.890> which

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
happens to be a seven ace movement which

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.830 
happens to be a seven ace movement which
is<00:01:36.490> measured<00:01:36.850> from<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.859> base<00:01:38.859> out<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.570> tip

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
is measured from the base out to the tip

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.310 
is measured from the base out to the tip
here<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.159> this<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> seven<00:01:43.359> ace<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:43.960> going

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
here so this is a seven ace it's going

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.950 
here so this is a seven ace it's going
into<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.619> half-inch<00:01:45.219> board<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:46.509> leaves<00:01:46.750> you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
into a half-inch board it leaves you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.169 
into a half-inch board it leaves you
just<00:01:47.250> enough<00:01:48.250> room<00:01:48.929> to<00:01:49.929> mount<00:01:50.140> your<00:01:50.500> hardware

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
just enough room to mount your hardware

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.480 
just enough room to mount your hardware
which<00:01:52.179> comes<00:01:52.420> all<00:01:52.600> prepackaged<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:54.399> a

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
spacer if you need it in here you'll

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.120 
spacer if you need it in here you'll
find<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.640> washer<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.560> locks<00:01:59.859> down

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
find a washer and then this locks down

hand there's a little cap
not<00:02:17.020> here<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:18.160> will<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:18.400> cover<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> end

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
not here that will then cover up the end

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.380 
not here that will then cover up the end
so<00:02:20.440> it'll<00:02:20.620> look<00:02:20.740> nice<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.160> finished<00:02:21.520> so

so it'll look nice and finished so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
so it'll look nice and finished so
there's<00:02:23.140> different<00:02:23.320> sizes<00:02:23.740> for<00:02:24.100> different

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
there's different sizes for different
