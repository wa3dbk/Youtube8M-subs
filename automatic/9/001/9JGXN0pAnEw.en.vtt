some<00:00:53.719> extra<00:00:54.719> walls<00:00:55.020> down<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.920> side<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:57.270> side

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
some extra walls down the side this side

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.750 
some extra walls down the side this side
on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> other<00:00:58.410> side<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.010> also<00:00:59.940> fenced<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
on the other side I also fenced off this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
on the other side I also fenced off this
careful<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.199> harder<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
careful at the back to make it harder to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.300 
careful at the back to make it harder to
get<00:01:05.040> into<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:06.350> cannons<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.619> also<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:08.130> the

get into the cannons and also down the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
get into the cannons and also down the
side<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.920> did<00:01:11.549> move<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:12.060> lightning

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
side as well I did move my lightning

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.249 
side as well I did move my lightning
tower<00:01:12.979> one<00:01:13.979> Square<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.869> any

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
tower one Square back this is so any

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
tower one Square back this is so any
trips<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> try<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.430> take<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.150> lightning

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
trips that try to get take my lightning

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.060 
trips that try to get take my lightning
tower<00:01:18.810> down<00:01:19.049> first<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tower down first we'll have to go

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.060 
tower down first we'll have to go
through<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.810> archer<00:01:21.810> towers<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:22.470> since

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
through my archer towers first since

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.020 
through my archer towers first since
they<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> closer<00:01:25.070> they<00:01:26.070> could<00:01:26.400> use<00:01:26.610> ramps

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they will be closer they could use ramps

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
they will be closer they could use ramps
to<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.479> through<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> wall<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> then

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to get in through this wall and then

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
to get in through this wall and then
break<00:01:28.829> into<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.220> wall<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.450> well<00:01:30.570> our

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
break into this wall and well our

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.219 
break into this wall and well our
archers<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:31.500> still<00:01:31.909> target<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:33.229> archer

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
archers would still target these archer

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.340 
archers would still target these archer
towers<00:01:34.470> before<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.220> lightning<00:01:35.430> tower<00:01:36.350> now

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
towers before the lightning tower now

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.219 
towers before the lightning tower now
I've<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:39.560> planned<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:42.229> Alliance

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I've also planned it so my Alliance

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
I've also planned it so my Alliance
troops<00:01:43.470> will<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.860> come<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.149> until<00:01:45.149> they've

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
troops will not come out until they've

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.510 
troops will not come out until they've
entered<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.350> radius<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.340> will

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
entered this radius here so they will

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
entered this radius here so they will
need<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.000> past<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> Archer<00:01:48.869> tower<00:01:49.079> first

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
need to get past this Archer tower first

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
need to get past this Archer tower first
they<00:01:50.159> may<00:01:50.399> commit<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.970> lot<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> troops<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:52.290> get

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
they may commit a lot of troops to get

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
they may commit a lot of troops to get
that<00:01:52.619> far<00:01:52.890> before<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.579> troops<00:01:53.939> come<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that far before my troops come out to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.800 
that far before my troops come out to
defend

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
defend

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
defend
what<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> done<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.280> placed<00:01:59.640> my

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
what have I done here I have placed my

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.300 
what have I done here I have placed my
extra<00:02:00.299> wall<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> middle<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:02.010> make<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
extra wall in the middle here to make it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
extra wall in the middle here to make it
look<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.940> may<00:02:03.150> be<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.690> traps<00:02:04.049> here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
look as if there may be some traps here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.020 
look as if there may be some traps here
but<00:02:05.130> there's<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:06.890> let's<00:02:07.890> discuss<00:02:08.580> why<00:02:08.850> I've

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
but there's not let's discuss why I've

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
but there's not let's discuss why I've
done<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.600> side<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:11.220> want

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
done this on the side here I don't want

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.050 
done this on the side here I don't want
my<00:02:11.700> freeze<00:02:12.090> tower<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.630> taken<00:02:13.020> down

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
my freeze tower to be taken down

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
my freeze tower to be taken down
straightaway<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.390> hoping<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:15.930> would<00:02:16.140> have

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
straightaway I'm hoping they would have

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.340 
straightaway I'm hoping they would have
to<00:02:16.560> target<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.190> our<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.489> towers<00:02:17.730> first<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.200> if

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
to target my our two towers first so if

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.640 
to target my our two towers first so if
they<00:02:19.530> were<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.830> use<00:02:20.100> troops<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:22.230> target

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
they were to use troops that to target

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.000 
they were to use troops that to target
that<00:02:22.880> they<00:02:23.880> were<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.180> drop<00:02:24.390> troops<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:25.080> they

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that they were to drop troops here they

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
that they were to drop troops here they
would<00:02:26.250> path<00:02:26.760> around<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.450> attack<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> yard

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
would path around and attack the yard

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.449 
would path around and attack the yard
two<00:02:28.260> towers<00:02:28.470> first<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:29.010> they<00:02:29.160> were<00:02:29.220> using

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
two towers first if they were using

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.600 
two towers first if they were using
commanders<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.680> other<00:02:31.680> trips<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.160> draw<00:02:32.310> into

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
commanders and other trips to draw into

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.750 
commanders and other trips to draw into
my<00:02:32.730> defensive<00:02:33.209> towers<00:02:33.830> also<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.250> ram<00:02:35.489> was

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
my defensive towers also if a ram was

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.860 
my defensive towers also if a ram was
dropped<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.739> they<00:02:37.739> may<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.450> too<00:02:39.450> close<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
dropped here they may be too close to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.530 
dropped here they may be too close to
the<00:02:39.959> wall<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.350> might<00:02:40.500> hit<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> wall<00:02:41.150> or<00:02:42.150> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the wall and it might hit the wall or it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.259 
the wall and it might hit the wall or it
will<00:02:42.830> maybe<00:02:43.830> target<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:44.489> two<00:02:44.760> walls<00:02:44.970> here

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
will maybe target these two walls here

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.150 
will maybe target these two walls here
and<00:02:45.300> miss<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.720> corner<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.350> will<00:02:46.890> be

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and miss the corner I will be

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.290 
and miss the corner I will be
strengthening<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.019> there's<00:02:49.019> corners<00:02:49.620> first

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
strengthening that there's corners first

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.040 
strengthening that there's corners first
these<00:02:51.300> three<00:02:51.690> walls<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:53.250> prevent<00:02:53.489> that

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
these three walls here to prevent that

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.930 
these three walls here to prevent that
also<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:56.280> hidden<00:02:57.090> wall<00:02:57.390> behind<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:58.940> if

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
also I have a hidden wall behind this if

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.150 
also I have a hidden wall behind this if
a<00:03:00.299> ram<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:00.900> dropped<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.590> may<00:03:01.799> hit<00:03:01.980> this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
a ram was dropped here it may hit this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160 
a ram was dropped here it may hit this
wall<00:03:02.430> first<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.150> prevent<00:03:04.019> them<00:03:04.140> from

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
wall first and prevent them from

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.340 
wall first and prevent them from
reaching<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.160> intersection<00:03:06.140> likewise<00:03:07.140> on

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
reaching the intersection likewise on

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.380 
reaching the intersection likewise on
the<00:03:07.380> other<00:03:07.590> side<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.579> same<00:03:08.820> over<00:03:09.090> here

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the other side I have the same over here

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.759 
the other side I have the same over here
so<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.810> also<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:15.079> reinforced<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.200> walls<00:03:16.440> here

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
so I also have reinforced the walls here

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.550 
so I also have reinforced the walls here
so<00:03:17.010> trips<00:03:17.280> may<00:03:17.670> be<00:03:17.730> forced<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.480> walk<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:19.260> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so trips may be forced to walk into this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.440 
so trips may be forced to walk into this
freeze<00:03:19.980> trap<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:22.370> likewise<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.239> front

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
freeze trap and likewise with in front

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
freeze trap and likewise with in front
of<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.720> cannon<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.380> put<00:03:25.829> them<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
of the cannon I put them there so it

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.050 
of the cannon I put them there so it
prevents<00:03:28.739> troops<00:03:29.130> from<00:03:29.340> getting<00:03:29.760> into<00:03:29.880> my

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
prevents troops from getting into my

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.080 
prevents troops from getting into my
blind<00:03:30.359> spot<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:34.170> us<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.799> think<00:03:35.700> there<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.030> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
blind spot with us I think there was a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.140 
blind spot with us I think there was a
few<00:03:36.390> other<00:03:36.540> things<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:37.260> planned<00:03:38.220> ahead<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.940> I

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
few other things I planned ahead here I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.069 
few other things I planned ahead here I
have<00:03:40.109> my<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:41.730> trips<00:03:42.000> were<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.540> try<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.930> get

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
have my your trips were to try and get

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.140 
have my your trips were to try and get
into<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.650> our<00:03:43.799> two<00:03:43.980> towers<00:03:44.370> down<00:03:44.549> below<00:03:44.880> they

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
into the our two towers down below they

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.430 
into the our two towers down below they
may<00:03:45.709> trigger<00:03:46.709> off<00:03:46.950> these<00:03:47.220> bomb<00:03:47.910> traps<00:03:48.440> on

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
may trigger off these bomb traps on

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.600 
may trigger off these bomb traps on
either<00:03:49.650> side

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.080 

and<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.150> think<00:03:53.330> that's<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.630> for<00:03:53.810> now<00:03:53.960> I<00:03:54.490> do<00:03:55.490> have

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
and I think that's it for now I do have

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.560 
and I think that's it for now I do have
one<00:03:56.450> defense<00:03:57.170> replay<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> show<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.070> already

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
one defense replay to show you already

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.720 
one defense replay to show you already
which<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.690> quite<00:03:59.990> good<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:01.310> let's<00:04:01.490> quickly

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
which is quite good so let's quickly

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:13.490 
which is quite good so let's quickly
bring<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.240> up<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.400> show<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.750> how<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.990> went

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.160 

now<00:04:14.040> let<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.220> go<00:04:14.340> quite<00:04:15.090> heavily<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
now let it go quite heavily on the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.699 
now let it go quite heavily on the
troops<00:04:16.650> there's<00:04:16.920> 200<00:04:17.700> housing<00:04:18.209> there<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:19.590> a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
troops there's 200 housing there it's a

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.590 
troops there's 200 housing there it's a
revenge<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.579> must<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:20.970> really<00:04:21.360> hit<00:04:21.450> this

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
revenge so I must have really hit this

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.020 
revenge so I must have really hit this
guy<00:04:21.930> hard<00:04:22.230> for<00:04:22.440> him<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.710> want<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.030> retaliate

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
guy hard for him to want to retaliate

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:34.280 
guy hard for him to want to retaliate
like<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.860> level<00:04:25.860> for<00:04:26.310> troops<00:04:33.260> luckily<00:04:34.260> I

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
like that level for troops luckily I

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.460 
like that level for troops luckily I
didn't<00:04:34.710> need<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.100> essence<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:37.080> yet<00:04:39.350> so<00:04:40.350> he's

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
didn't need the essence just yet so he's

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.910 
didn't need the essence just yet so he's
gone<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.740> hard<00:04:40.980> with<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.280> Sam<00:04:41.520> your<00:04:41.670> eyes<00:04:41.850> I

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
gone in hard with the Sam your eyes I

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.910 
gone in hard with the Sam your eyes I
think<00:04:43.920> I'd<00:04:44.040> been<00:04:44.220> offline<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:44.610> four<00:04:44.970> hours

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
think I'd been offline for four hours

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.710 
think I'd been offline for four hours
so<00:04:46.920> he's<00:04:47.070> chosen<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.490> use<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.790> rams<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.510> go<00:04:48.660> to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
so he's chosen to use the rams to go to

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.780 
so he's chosen to use the rams to go to
the<00:04:48.900> sides<00:04:49.200> didn't<00:04:50.010> fall<00:04:50.250> for<00:04:50.460> any<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.700> my

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
the sides didn't fall for any of my

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.340 
the sides didn't fall for any of my
traps<00:04:52.790> my<00:04:53.790> trips<00:04:54.120> have<00:04:54.300> been<00:04:54.450> activated<00:04:54.900> down

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
traps my trips have been activated down

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.650 
traps my trips have been activated down
here<00:04:58.670> they're<00:04:59.670> helping<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.060> lot<00:05:00.210> now<00:05:00.390> with<00:05:00.420> a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
here they're helping a lot now with a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.310 
here they're helping a lot now with a
lightning<00:05:00.930> tail<00:05:01.290> hitting<00:05:01.620> them<00:05:03.140> same<00:05:04.140> with

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
lightning tail hitting them same with

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.490 
lightning tail hitting them same with
the<00:05:04.410> lightning<00:05:04.740> tower<00:05:04.950> here<00:05:05.370> it's<00:05:05.669> really

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
the lightning tower here it's really

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.080 
the lightning tower here it's really
stalling<00:05:07.500> them<00:05:07.620> for<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> while<00:05:08.070> when<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.430> can<00:05:09.060> I

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
stalling them for a while when I can I

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.150 
stalling them for a while when I can I
hit<00:05:09.360> them

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.689 

if<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.310> get<00:05:14.520> two<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.880> my<00:05:15.030> storage

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
if you get two of my storage

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.670 
if you get two of my storage
luckily<00:05:17.699> my<00:05:18.120> coin<00:05:18.479> storage<00:05:18.960> was<00:05:19.139> quite<00:05:19.380> low<00:05:19.560> at

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
luckily my coin storage was quite low at

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.240 
luckily my coin storage was quite low at
the<00:05:19.800> time<00:05:20.009> I<00:05:21.050> need<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.080> reinforce<00:05:22.470> those<00:05:22.889> walls

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
the time I need to reinforce those walls

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.249 
the time I need to reinforce those walls
to<00:05:23.430> prevent<00:05:23.910> them<00:05:24.090> from<00:05:24.120> doing<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:24.960> with

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
to prevent them from doing that with

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.890 
to prevent them from doing that with
ramps<00:05:28.520> so<00:05:29.520> now<00:05:29.669> he's<00:05:29.820> left<00:05:30.000> with<00:05:30.180> arches<00:05:30.600> which

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
ramps so now he's left with arches which

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.719 
ramps so now he's left with arches which
are<00:05:31.110> going<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.590> last<00:05:31.800> very<00:05:32.070> long<00:05:32.280> with<00:05:32.520> my

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
are going to last very long with my

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:44.950 
are going to last very long with my
cannons

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.350 

so<00:05:45.530> it's<00:05:45.680> good<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:46.039> have<00:05:46.190> those<00:05:46.430> cannons

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
so it's good to have those cannons

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.320 
so it's good to have those cannons
around<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.870> castle<00:05:48.729> they're<00:05:49.729> really<00:05:49.970> hard<00:05:50.180> to

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
around the castle they're really hard to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.870 
around the castle they're really hard to
take<00:05:50.479> down

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
take down

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.340 
take down
fortunately<00:05:52.880> my<00:05:53.120> drum<00:05:53.600> gun<00:05:53.870> is<00:05:53.990> in<00:05:54.139> range

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
fortunately my drum gun is in range

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.810 
fortunately my drum gun is in range
there<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.830> it's<00:05:54.919> still<00:05:55.100> taking<00:05:55.310> them<00:05:55.490> out<00:05:55.669> as

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
there and it's still taking them out as

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.520 
there and it's still taking them out as
well<00:05:56.470> that's<00:05:57.470> defending<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:59.410> cannon<00:06:00.410> which

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
well that's defending the cannon which

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.770 
well that's defending the cannon which
got<00:06:00.740> taken<00:06:01.100> down<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.639> as<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.210> can<00:06:02.330> see<00:06:02.570> he

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
got taken down and as you can see he

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.999 
got taken down and as you can see he
just<00:06:02.810> missed<00:06:03.470> out<00:06:03.710> on<00:06:03.740> my<00:06:03.919> castle

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
just missed out on my castle

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.390 
just missed out on my castle
so<00:06:07.009> that<00:06:07.190> was<00:06:08.590> lucky<00:06:09.590> there<00:06:09.889> I<00:06:09.949> didn't<00:06:10.220> lose

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
so that was lucky there I didn't lose

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.159 
so that was lucky there I didn't lose
the<00:06:10.550> loop<00:06:13.060> so<00:06:14.060> there<00:06:14.150> you<00:06:14.210> have<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.419> it's<00:06:14.960> not

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
the loop so there you have it it's not

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.689 
the loop so there you have it it's not
too<00:06:15.350> bad<00:06:16.000> considering<00:06:17.000> 200<00:06:17.690> troops<00:06:18.699> up

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
too bad considering 200 troops up

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.330 
too bad considering 200 troops up
against<00:06:20.180> me<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.479> he<00:06:21.199> took<00:06:21.770> half<00:06:22.039> of<00:06:22.160> my

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
against me and he took half of my

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.680 
against me and he took half of my
storage<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:24.020> handled<00:06:24.349> that<00:06:24.440> pretty<00:06:24.650> well<00:06:25.690> and

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
storage and handled that pretty well and

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.629 
storage and handled that pretty well and
I<00:06:26.780> have<00:06:26.960> one<00:06:27.169> upgrading<00:06:27.800> cannon<00:06:28.220> over<00:06:28.430> there

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
I have one upgrading cannon over there

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.180 
I have one upgrading cannon over there
and<00:06:29.180> in<00:06:29.300> my<00:06:29.479> second<00:06:30.410> lightning<00:06:30.770> tower<00:06:31.009> is

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
and in my second lightning tower is

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.820 
and in my second lightning tower is
being<00:06:31.400> built<00:06:31.669> so<00:06:32.289> I'll<00:06:33.289> bring<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.620> more

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
being built so I'll bring you more

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.670 
being built so I'll bring you more
replays<00:06:34.430> as<00:06:34.699> what<00:06:35.090> when<00:06:35.449> I<00:06:35.479> have<00:06:35.750> them<00:06:35.930> stay

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
replays as what when I have them stay

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.029 
replays as what when I have them stay
tuned<00:06:36.949> for<00:06:37.160> that<00:06:37.190> and<00:06:38.410> let<00:06:39.410> me<00:06:39.440> know<00:06:39.560> what<00:06:39.949> you

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
tuned for that and let me know what you

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.680 
tuned for that and let me know what you
think<00:06:40.190> of<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.520> new<00:06:40.789> design<00:06:41.090> in<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.330> comments

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
think of the new design in the comments

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.129 
think of the new design in the comments
