I

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:18.590 

right

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.780 

hi<00:00:19.200> this<00:00:19.440> is<00:00:19.470> Dan<00:00:19.710> Moskowitz<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.580> video

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
hi this is Dan Moskowitz in this video

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.550 
hi this is Dan Moskowitz in this video
will<00:00:21.120> show<00:00:21.150> off<00:00:21.450> our<00:00:21.600> new<00:00:21.780> simulation<00:00:22.410> engine

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
will show off our new simulation engine

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
will show off our new simulation engine
glass<00:00:23.070> box<00:00:23.370> and<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.030> using<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.450> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
glass box and how we're using it to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600 
glass box and how we're using it to
simulate<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.200> basic<00:00:25.560> economic<00:00:26.100> loop<00:00:26.310> between

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
simulate the basic economic loop between

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.490 
simulate the basic economic loop between
residential<00:00:27.540> industrial<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.380> commercial

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
residential industrial and commercial

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200 
residential industrial and commercial
buildings<00:00:28.920> keep<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.700> mind<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
buildings keep in mind that this

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.180 
buildings keep in mind that this
demonstration<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.990> showing<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:31.470> simulation

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
demonstration is showing off simulation

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.850 
demonstration is showing off simulation
behavior<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.030> graphics<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.770> I've

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
behavior and not graphics so here I've

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.790 
behavior and not graphics so here I've
got<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> small<00:00:35.430> town<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.879> I<00:00:35.970> built<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
got a small town that I built it has a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
got a small town that I built it has a
pretty<00:00:38.460> small<00:00:38.700> residential<00:00:39.150> neighborhood

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
pretty small residential neighborhood

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.440 
pretty small residential neighborhood
and<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.920> block<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.370> industrial<00:00:41.850> buildings<00:00:42.210> over

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and a block of industrial buildings over

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.960 
and a block of industrial buildings over
here<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:43.440> almost<00:00:43.680> 6am<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.489> city<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
here it's almost 6am in my city and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.400 
here it's almost 6am in my city and
that's<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.570> industrial<00:00:46.080> buildings

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that's when the industrial buildings

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
that's when the industrial buildings
turn<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.040> for<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> day<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.150> thing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
turn on for the day the first thing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
turn on for the day the first thing
their<00:00:48.449> rules<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.230> tell<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.830> they

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
their rules do is tell them that they

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200 
their rules do is tell them that they
don't<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.190> any<00:00:50.309> workers<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.879> need<00:00:51.089> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
don't have any workers so they need to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
don't have any workers so they need to
send<00:00:51.330> out<00:00:51.540> some<00:00:51.780> help<00:00:52.019> wanted<00:00:52.379> requests<00:00:53.040> these

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
send out some help wanted requests these

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
send out some help wanted requests these
are<00:00:54.030> agents<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.629> are<00:00:54.690> invisible<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.170> the

look for residential buildings to

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.380 
look for residential buildings to
basically<00:01:00.870> knock<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.470> door<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.239> send<00:01:03.239> out

the rules that produce the goods are the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.270 
the rules that produce the goods are the
same<00:01:28.020> rules<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> produce<00:01:28.770> air<00:01:29.130> pollution

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
same rules that produce air pollution

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
same rules that produce air pollution
the<00:01:32.280> simulation<00:01:32.789> rules<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.210> create<00:01:33.479> the

the simulation rules that create the

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
goods are also creating air pollution

goods are also creating air pollution
here<00:01:37.289> we<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.619> buildings<00:01:38.310> writing<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.880> air

here we see buildings writing to the air
pollution<00:01:39.420> map<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.860> same<00:01:41.039> rule

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
pollution map and it's the same rule

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that triggers the smoke effect and here

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.430 
that triggers the smoke effect and here
we<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.679> debug<00:01:43.979> visualization<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.939> map
