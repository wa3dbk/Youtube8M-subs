Canucks right all right let's talk
equipment<00:00:11.070> obviously<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> most<00:00:12.090> amount<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
equipment obviously the most amount of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.730 
equipment obviously the most amount of
equipment<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:12.929> any<00:00:13.049> player<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> expect

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
equipment for any player I expect

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.950 
equipment for any player I expect
exactly<00:00:14.389> first<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> talk

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
exactly first up we're going to talk

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.870 
exactly first up we're going to talk
about<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.260> pads<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.250> most<00:00:17.430> important

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
about the pads it is the most important

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.070 
about the pads it is the most important
piece<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.029> equipment<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.660> probably<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
piece of equipment and probably the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.050 
piece of equipment and probably the
biggest<00:00:19.199> change<00:00:19.619> well<00:00:20.340> you've<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.910> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
biggest change well you've got on is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880 
biggest change well you've got on is
called<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> hybrid<00:00:21.689> pad<00:00:21.900> okay<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.619> more<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
called the hybrid pad okay it's more of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
called the hybrid pad okay it's more of
a<00:00:22.949> fitted<00:00:23.369> pad<00:00:23.580> okay<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> be

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a fitted pad okay so it's going to be

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
a fitted pad okay so it's going to be
tighter<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.439> leg<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.609> you'll<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
tighter on your leg so that way you'll a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
tighter on your leg so that way you'll a
little<00:00:27.029> bit<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.359> secure<00:00:27.779> we've<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.050> some

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
little bit more secure we've got some

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.419 
little bit more secure we've got some
breaks<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
breaks in here for it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
breaks in here for it
so<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:29.970> it'll<00:00:30.119> sit<00:00:30.420> more<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> little

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so that way it'll sit more is a little

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.190 
so that way it'll sit more is a little
bit<00:00:31.439> easier<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> move<00:00:32.160> around<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:33.020> our<00:00:34.020> goals

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
bit easier to move around in our goals

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.030 
bit easier to move around in our goals
but<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.010> necessarily<00:00:35.510> silent<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.040> time

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
but not necessarily silent at this time

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
but not necessarily silent at this time
one<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.420> open

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
one we have here is more of an open

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440 
one we have here is more of an open
channel<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.399> does<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> it'll<00:00:41.790> roll<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
channel so what it does is it'll roll to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.610 
channel so what it does is it'll roll to
the<00:00:42.480> ice<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:43.020> upper<00:00:43.260> boys<00:00:43.440> they

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the ice a little bit upper boys they

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
the ice a little bit upper boys they
like<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.340> butterfly<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.180> means

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
like to be in a butterfly what it means

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
like to be in a butterfly what it means
when<00:00:45.480> they're<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> ice<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
when they're on the ice and also to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
when they're on the ice and also to
it'll<00:00:47.640> seal<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> ice<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.870> well<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it'll seal to the ice very well and a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
it'll seal to the ice very well and a
lot<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> gold<00:00:50.340> tenders<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:51.090> actually

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
lot of gold tenders now they actually

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.119 
lot of gold tenders now they actually
move<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> ice<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> view<00:00:52.860> off

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
move on the ice as well as the view off

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
move on the ice as well as the view off
the<00:00:53.340> ice<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:53.760> important<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> note<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.600> we

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the ice that's important to note now we

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
the ice that's important to note now we
have<00:00:54.899> course<00:00:55.230> different<00:00:55.920> goalies<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
have course different goalies here we

awesome yeah let's talk skates they are
a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.140> different<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.680> are

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a little bit different right they are

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.139 
a little bit different right they are
very<00:01:02.250> different<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> again<00:01:02.820> big

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
very different and again big

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690 
very different and again big
advancements<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.470> goaltending<00:01:05.070> skates<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.519> got

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
advancements in goaltending skates I got

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390 
advancements in goaltending skates I got
the<00:01:05.820> newest<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.420> CCM<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.250> what<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the newest one from CCM here what it's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
the newest one from CCM here what it's
done<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.330> they've<00:01:09.479> done<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
done is now what they've done is more of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
done is now what they've done is more of
a<00:01:10.290> molded<00:01:10.680> boot<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.189> okay<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> used<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
a molded boot here okay it used to be a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
a molded boot here okay it used to be a
lot<00:01:12.390> bigger<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> again<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.340> we

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
lot bigger and also to again what we

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
lot bigger and also to again what we
talked<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.820> earlier<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:16.020> goaltender's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
talked about earlier was goaltender's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
talked about earlier was goaltender's
have<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.280> able<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> move<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> ice

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
have to be able to move on the ice

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
have to be able to move on the ice
really<00:01:18.630> well<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.259> demonstrate<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really well we will demonstrate that a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
really well we will demonstrate that a
little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.159> later<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> they've<00:01:21.180> cut<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
little bit later and they've cut this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
little bit later and they've cut this
out<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.680> skates<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> ice

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
out so you can get the skates of the ice

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
out so you can get the skates of the ice
that<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.509> easier<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.140> when<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.470> down

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that much easier so when they go down

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
that much easier so when they go down
you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.070> flatter<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> padding<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you can get flatter to the padding of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
you can get flatter to the padding of
flatter<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.290> push<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> ice<00:01:29.040> how

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
flatter and you can push on the ice how

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
flatter and you can push on the ice how
much<00:01:29.400> better<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.540> weight<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> decrease

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
much better and the weight is decrease

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
much better and the weight is decrease
probably<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.070> half<00:01:32.400> oh<00:01:33.079> well<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.380> I'm

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
probably about half oh well you know I'm

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.810 
probably about half oh well you know I'm
gonna<00:01:34.740> continue<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.280> geared<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.610> let's

as well they tell me Jodi I don't have
to<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.400> flexible<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.690> goalie<00:01:45.990> even<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
to be flexible to be a goalie even to

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.230 
to be flexible to be a goalie even to
butterfly<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.280> we're<00:01:47.400> gonna<00:01:47.490> find<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:48.030> I'm

gonna<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> ice<00:01:48.810> coming<00:01:49.050> up<00:01:49.229> next<00:01:49.440> Oh

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
gonna get on the ice coming up next Oh

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.859 
gonna get on the ice coming up next Oh
looking<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> part<00:01:51.030> doesn't<00:01:51.210> mean<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> am<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
looking the part doesn't mean I am the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.430 
looking the part doesn't mean I am the
part

Joey<00:01:53.280> skating<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.180> an<00:01:54.450> important<00:01:54.810> aspect<00:01:55.080> for

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
Joey skating is an important aspect for

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.490 
Joey skating is an important aspect for
goalie<00:01:55.619> yes<00:01:56.310> absolutely<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.900> thought<00:01:58.410> in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
goalie yes absolutely it was thought in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
goalie yes absolutely it was thought in
the<00:01:58.590> past<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.009> skin<00:01:59.280> wasn't<00:01:59.490> huge<00:01:59.820> aspect

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the past that skin wasn't huge aspect

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030 
the past that skin wasn't huge aspect
but<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> matter<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.690> fact<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.650> goal<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
but a matter of fact it is as a goal you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.109 
but a matter of fact it is as a goal you
get<00:02:02.130> 30<00:02:02.369> shots<00:02:02.610> 30<00:02:02.909> seconds<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
get 30 shots 30 seconds and with that

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.550 
get 30 shots 30 seconds and with that
for<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.180> after<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.600> 59<00:02:07.110> minutes<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.350> 30

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
for the after than 59 minutes and 30

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.870 
for the after than 59 minutes and 30
seconds<00:02:07.830> were<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.160> moving<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.759> need

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
seconds were actually moving so we need

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.460 
seconds were actually moving so we need
to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.119> new<00:02:09.300> hot<00:02:09.509> escape<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.020> got<00:02:10.170> three

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
to do new hot escape so we got three

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
to do new hot escape so we got three
skating<00:02:10.860> techniques<00:02:11.250> show<00:02:11.400> us<00:02:11.520> quickly<00:02:11.730> never

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
skating techniques show us quickly never

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.550 
skating techniques show us quickly never
exceed<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.690> first<00:02:12.930> ones<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> eagle-eyed

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
exceed the first ones that eagle-eyed

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.810 
exceed the first ones that eagle-eyed
it's<00:02:13.680> used<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:13.950> long<00:02:14.100> distances<00:02:14.640> when

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
it's used for long distances when

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's used for long distances when
goalies<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> move<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> long<00:02:15.690> distance

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
goalies have to move a long distance

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
goalies have to move a long distance
which<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.350> spike<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.790> with<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> nice<00:02:18.060> strong

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
which will spike this with a nice strong

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
which will spike this with a nice strong
powerful<00:02:19.080> push<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.739> your<00:02:19.830> crease

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
powerful push to get from your crease

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.680 
powerful push to get from your crease
back<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.670> we'll<00:02:20.910> demo<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> goalies

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
back and we'll demo with the goalies

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.040 
back and we'll demo with the goalies
here

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
here

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.650 
here
okay<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.440> again<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:23.730> particular<00:02:24.000> move<00:02:24.480> they

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
okay so again this particular move they

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
okay so again this particular move they
would<00:02:24.750> use<00:02:24.930> him<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.980> would<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.250> used<00:02:26.430> for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
would use him how this would be used for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
would use him how this would be used for
moving<00:02:26.850> when<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> demon<00:02:27.510> passes<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.260> too

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
moving when a demon passes to be too

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.590 
moving when a demon passes to be too
deep<00:02:28.530> or<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.130> player<00:02:29.340> moves<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> from<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
deep or if a player moves it from the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.449 
deep or if a player moves it from the
blue<00:02:30.750> line<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.320> corner<00:02:31.739> essentially

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
blue line down to the corner essentially

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.350 
blue line down to the corner essentially
when<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> goalie<00:02:32.880> has<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> make<00:02:33.330> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
when the goalie has to make a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.880 
when the goalie has to make a
long-distance<00:02:33.900> movement<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.650> would<00:02:34.769> use

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
long-distance movement they would use

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.080 
long-distance movement they would use
this<00:02:35.040> technique<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.519> get<00:02:35.610> there<00:02:35.790> efficiently

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
this technique to get there efficiently

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.340 
this technique to get there efficiently
the<00:02:39.090> next<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.540> we're<00:02:39.660> gonna<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.140> called

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the next one we're gonna do is called

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
the next one we're gonna do is called
the<00:02:40.380> butterfly<00:02:40.560> slide<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.340> techniques<00:02:41.760> use

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the butterfly slide this techniques use

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
the butterfly slide this techniques use
when<00:02:42.450> goalies<00:02:42.720> need<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.019> move<00:02:43.230> across<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.829> net

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
when goalies need to move across the net

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.150 
when goalies need to move across the net
or<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.910> make<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> scene<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.860> we'll<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
or to make a scene so we'll have the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.410 
or to make a scene so we'll have the
goalie<00:02:47.340> through<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.640> butterfly<00:02:48.000> flight<00:02:48.269> as

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
goalie through the butterfly flight as

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.410 
goalie through the butterfly flight as
well<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.829> again<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.700> would<00:02:50.850> be<00:02:50.910> used<00:02:51.180> when

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
well so again this would be used when

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.060 
well so again this would be used when
it's<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.690> quick<00:02:51.930> pass<00:02:52.170> across<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.769> net<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
it's a quick pass across the net you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.890 
it's a quick pass across the net you
would<00:02:53.160> use<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.519> slide<00:02:53.790> across<00:02:54.090> either<00:02:54.630> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
would use it to slide across either to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.750 
would use it to slide across either to
get<00:02:55.079> there<00:02:55.320> or<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.040> actually<00:02:56.340> make<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.700> save

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
get there or to actually make the save
