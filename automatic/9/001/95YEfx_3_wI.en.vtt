00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Greetings dear friend is 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.290
 final lesson on farming simulator 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.670
 2015 and in it we will talk about 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.120
 how to make money on static objects 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 such as windmills or greenhouses and so 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 next we start with the hives and understand nothing 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.160
 easier just buy them and put in those 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 places where they will interfere less 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.330
 just let yourself buzz more from you 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.010
 do not need anything the income itself will be 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.010
 come to your wallet every day 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.940
 however if you donâ€™t like constant 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.250
 buzzing near the house or you are afraid to be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.540
 stung ass you can fork and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 buy solar panels 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.860
 they are put absolutely similar 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.150
 way back except they can not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.059
 turn as they will 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.530
 turn to the sun 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.910
 income from them will also be reasonable 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.910
 enter your bank account 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.900
 but if you're already a wealthy guy from 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.640
 could knock myself some state 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.220
 you can put on the joy of local 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.379
 residents of several wind turbines they 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.420
 will generate electricity from 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.690
 wind and you will receive for it 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.310
 good income 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.479
 it's better to put them away from home for 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.680
 there will be an infection very loudly but we are 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.650
 time go to the most interesting 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.930
 to greenhouses here have a little bit 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.070
 work to start have to buy 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.869
 wheel loader 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.700
 unless of course you have him except 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.369
 addition we need a water tank 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.909
 for greenhouses to give decent 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.630
 the harvest 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.340
 they need solid manure and water water in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.170
 the tank can be dialed from various 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.049
 sources that are spread across 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.780
 the map after which the tank should bring 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.799
 close to the reservoir near the greenhouse and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.799
 pour water 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.200
 also strongly required in the greenhouse manure 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.540
 considering this when you make 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370
 your greenhouses so that you donâ€™t have to go far 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.690
 ride 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.910
 front loader with special 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.310
 grab for solid manure recruit and 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.340
 we take it directly to the greenhouse where 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.290
 in the appropriate box pour greenhouses 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.120
 only then will it be understood when both 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.750
 resource will be supplied in sufficient 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.330
 the amount and on this I finish the series 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.060
