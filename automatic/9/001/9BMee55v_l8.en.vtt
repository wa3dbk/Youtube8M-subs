at the same time so we're going to start

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.399 
at the same time so we're going to start
with<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.189> half<00:01:50.399> pulls<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.970> believe<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.630> low

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
with some half pulls I believe at low

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
with some half pulls I believe at low
levels<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.670> swimming<00:01:54.329> ability<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> lot

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
levels of of swimming ability for a lot

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
levels of of swimming ability for a lot
of<00:01:55.290> novice<00:01:55.710> swimmers<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.219> coach<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.790> have

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
of novice swimmers that I coach I have

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
of novice swimmers that I coach I have
them<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> lot<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.899> exercises<00:01:58.649> using<00:01:59.070> stretch

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
them do a lot of exercises using stretch

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.249 
them do a lot of exercises using stretch
sports<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> build<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> coordination<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
sports to build the coordination that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
sports to build the coordination that
I'm<00:02:01.409> talking<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.700> keep<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:03.630> flat

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I'm talking about so keep that back flat

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
I'm talking about so keep that back flat
slight<00:02:04.409> bend<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> knee<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.640> start<00:02:06.030> with

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
slight bend in the knee we start with

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
slight bend in the knee we start with
some<00:02:06.360> half<00:02:06.630> pulls<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> again<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.190> he

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
some half pulls and again what is he

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.600 
some half pulls and again what is he
training<00:02:08.670> he

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
training he

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.960 
training he
the<00:02:09.880> coordination<00:02:10.950> okay<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.400> build<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.820> that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the coordination okay to build in that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
the coordination okay to build in that
effective<00:02:13.480> catch<00:02:13.690> okay<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.040> something

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
effective catch okay this is something

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.410 
effective catch okay this is something
you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.490> do<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:15.640> your<00:02:15.910> own<00:02:15.940> with<00:02:16.210> stretch

you can do on your own with stretch

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.700 
you can do on your own with stretch
cords<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.840> do<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.140> front<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.470> mirror

stand in front of their mirror and just

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.060 
stand in front of their mirror and just
watch<00:02:19.600> yourself<00:02:20.110> doing<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.620> because

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
watch yourself doing this because

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.470 
watch yourself doing this because
remember<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.360> do

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
remember this is what you have to do

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.260 
remember this is what you have to do
repeatedly<00:02:23.170> over<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.800> over<00:02:24.100> again<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.730> the

the<00:02:26.230> idea<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.190> literally<00:02:27.640> reach<00:02:27.940> over<00:02:28.330> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the idea is to literally reach over that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.260 
the idea is to literally reach over that
barrel<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.380> put<00:02:29.590> pressure<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.430> handle<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
barrel to put pressure on the handle to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.600 
barrel to put pressure on the handle to
engage<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.900> upper<00:02:32.170> part<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.920> muscles<00:02:33.520> of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
engage the upper part of the muscles of

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.180 
engage the upper part of the muscles of
the<00:02:33.670> upper<00:02:33.760> back<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.870> build<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the upper back to build in the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610 
the upper back to build in the
coordination<00:02:36.820> that's<00:02:37.240> required<00:02:37.660> we'll<00:02:38.410> go

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
coordination that's required we'll go

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.020 
coordination that's required we'll go
through<00:02:38.830> ten<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.130> fifteen<00:02:39.550> then<00:02:39.730> he's<00:02:39.880> going

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
through ten to fifteen then he's going

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.380 
through ten to fifteen then he's going
to<00:02:40.120> jump<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.660> ERG<00:02:40.780> door<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.070> one<00:02:42.400> he's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
to jump on the ERG door is that one he's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.680 
to jump on the ERG door is that one he's
going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.290> warm<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.740> 100<00:02:45.550> meters<00:02:45.730> okay

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
going to just a warm up 100 meters okay

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.900 
going to just a warm up 100 meters okay
then<00:02:47.680> we're<00:02:47.800> going<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.950> move<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.340> door<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.700> two

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
then we're going to move the door to two

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.330

some<00:03:09.610> external<00:03:10.120> rotation<00:03:10.660> exercises<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
some external rotation exercises that I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.340 
some external rotation exercises that I
like<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.880> athletes<00:03:13.330> do<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> improve<00:03:14.110> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
like to have athletes do to improve the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.410 
like to have athletes do to improve the
strength<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> external<00:03:15.519> rotators<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.299> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
strength of the external rotators of the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.170 
strength of the external rotators of the
shoulder<00:03:16.780> again<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.110> protect<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.650> shoulder

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
shoulder again to protect the shoulder

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.460 
shoulder again to protect the shoulder
then<00:03:19.180> he's<00:03:19.299> going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:19.630> some<00:03:19.840> power<00:03:20.019> wheel

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
then he's going to do some power wheel

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.340 
then he's going to do some power wheel
rollouts<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> going<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.750> get<00:03:22.870> back<00:03:23.049> on<00:03:23.230> the

the focus is on a high elbow Todd you're

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
the focus is on a high elbow Todd you're
dropping<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.560> elbow<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.250> little<00:03:30.489> bit

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.160 

keep<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.910> elbow<00:03:36.090> high<00:03:36.300> remember<00:03:36.750> there<00:03:37.050> we

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
keep that elbow high remember there we

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.650 
keep that elbow high remember there we
go<00:03:37.320> yeah

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.350 

so<00:03:44.200> again<00:03:44.500> going<00:03:45.130> through<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.430> process<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.090> on

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
so again going through a process of on

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360 
so again going through a process of on
the<00:03:46.630> earth<00:03:46.810> off<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.380> earth<00:03:47.530> what's<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the earth off the earth what's the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.680 
the earth off the earth what's the
advantage<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.090> kind<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.390> session

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
advantage in this kind of session

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.420 
advantage in this kind of session
because<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.020> can<00:03:50.170> always<00:03:50.650> monitor<00:03:51.250> your

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
because you can always monitor your

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.910 
because you can always monitor your
stroke<00:03:51.730> quality<00:03:52.300> how<00:03:52.930> am<00:03:53.170> i<00:03:53.290> effectively

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
stroke quality how am i effectively

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.980 
stroke quality how am i effectively
catching<00:03:54.310> water<00:03:54.550> you're<00:03:55.180> building<00:03:55.750> swimming

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
catching water you're building swimming

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.960 
catching water you're building swimming
specific<00:03:56.680> strength<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.850> never

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
specific strength here so you never

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.400 
specific strength here so you never
think<00:03:58.270> about<00:03:58.420> swimming<00:03:58.930> from<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.170> strength

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
think about swimming from a strength

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.710 
think about swimming from a strength
standpoint<00:03:59.710> do<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.250> but<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.850> reality<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.420> it's

standpoint do we but the reality is it's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.410 
standpoint do we but the reality is it's
usually<00:04:01.870> important<00:04:02.530> when<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.100> meet<00:04:03.580> the

what they should do they usually can't

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.100 
what they should do they usually can't
do<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.490> because<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.480> soon<00:04:13.600> as<00:04:13.690> they<00:04:13.810> get<00:04:13.930> into

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
do it because as soon as they get into

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.729 
do it because as soon as they get into
water<00:04:14.440> what<00:04:14.710> happens<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.940> elbow<00:04:16.239> drops<00:04:16.739> takes

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
water what happens the elbow drops takes

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.260 
water what happens the elbow drops takes
a<00:04:17.830> lot<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.040> strength<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.670> be<00:04:18.790> able<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.060> keep

thousands hundreds of thousands of yards
you've<00:04:29.440> built<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.860> correct<00:04:30.700> strength<00:04:31.120> okay

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
you've built that correct strength okay

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.420 
you've built that correct strength okay
that's<00:04:32.230> what<00:04:32.500> we're<00:04:32.620> trying<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.950> build<00:04:33.100> on<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
that's what we're trying to build on the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.480 
that's what we're trying to build on the
earth

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.120 

close<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.120> 100<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:44.380> actually<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.740> display<00:04:44.950> I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
close to 100 and actually the display I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.890 
close to 100 and actually the display I
think<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:47.560> on<00:04:47.760> average<00:04:48.760> isn't<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.090> on<00:04:49.780> the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
think is it's on average isn't it on the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.260 
think is it's on average isn't it on the
wrong<00:04:50.050> display

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.779 

we<00:04:53.780> go<00:04:53.900> there<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.169> go<00:04:54.320> yeah<00:04:54.680> okay<00:04:55.430> he's<00:04:55.550> five

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
we go there you go yeah okay he's five

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.350 
we go there you go yeah okay he's five
meters<00:04:57.820> okay<00:04:58.820> what's<00:04:59.030> next

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
meters okay what's next

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.740 
meters okay what's next
okay<00:05:00.320> fifty<00:05:00.830> more<00:05:01.009> nor<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.940> now<00:05:02.570> we're

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
okay fifty more nor is it to now we're

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.390 
okay fifty more nor is it to now we're
going<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.900> raise<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.380> intensity<00:05:03.860> slightly

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
going to raise the intensity slightly

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.439 
going to raise the intensity slightly
he's<00:05:04.520> going<00:05:04.699> through<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.940> little<00:05:05.180> bit<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.300> a

he's going through a little bit of a

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.010 
he's going through a little bit of a
warm-up<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.580> again<00:05:07.580> he's<00:05:08.389> dropping<00:05:08.930> his

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
warm-up and again he's dropping his

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.900 
warm-up and again he's dropping his
elbow<00:05:09.380> every<00:05:09.860> stroke<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.340> he<00:05:10.400> takes<00:05:10.729> now

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
elbow every stroke that he takes now

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.969 
elbow every stroke that he takes now
he's<00:05:11.120> got<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.389> focus<00:05:11.630> on<00:05:11.990> perfect<00:05:12.410> form<00:05:12.680> you

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
he's got to focus on perfect form you

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.490 
he's got to focus on perfect form you
can<00:05:13.160> monitor<00:05:13.759> it<00:05:13.910> yourself<00:05:14.419> this<00:05:14.990> is<00:05:15.259> how<00:05:15.440> you

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
can monitor it yourself this is how you

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.890 
can monitor it yourself this is how you
build<00:05:15.860> correct<00:05:16.400> technique<00:05:16.880> by<00:05:17.449> doing<00:05:17.810> it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
build correct technique by doing it

correctly over and over again a
progressive<00:05:19.940> resistance<00:05:20.090> levels<00:05:20.860> now<00:05:21.860> this

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
progressive resistance levels now this

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.770 
progressive resistance levels now this
is<00:05:22.190> only<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.490> door<00:05:22.699> level<00:05:23.060> or<00:05:23.150> -<00:05:23.300> we<00:05:23.419> got<00:05:23.570> seven
