00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.289
 I think that at this moment 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.230
 there have already been dialogues with the mamos coi 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.910
 and with the chapter because it was missing that 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.790
 were the wiwas that were the 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.730
 jobs I think this is already complete 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.129
 the team that should be today then 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.970
 now at this moment it becomes something 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.230
 decisive not of us analyzing 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.100
 the project that you have 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.530
 It is viable because it does not harm anything 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.559
 contrary 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.300
 and you were talking at the moment with Julian 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.329
 say I think it becomes more none 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 school how to protect nature and 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:00.100
 the active culture that is so much fought 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.899
 of the protection of nature and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 the culture in Colombia as I said 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.390
 Roger I want 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.479
 that is to say that when there is agreement when 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.130
 dialogue when it is a dialogue with 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.590
 Respect and trust can be 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600
 You can talk quietly 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.539
 can come to results this is a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.550
 result of that kind of dialogue when 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.920
 there is that kind of dialogue 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 the government has to know the dialogue 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.250
 that we have developed and the agreement to 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.450
 that we have arrived what you want to say 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.770
 that you do not need a process of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.299
 query 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.310
 a consultation process is necessary 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.140
 when there are threats when there is no 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.600
 possibility of dialogue when there is no 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.420
 approaches when there are differences in 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.630
 this case there are no differences we think that 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 the project 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 is compatible to our way of thinking 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 and you have proposed it they have said that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 These are learning labs 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.550
 What I 'm seeing this month 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.909
 grateful sense grateful here in this 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.369
 here 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.069
 then I as the living people I 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.400
 I will reach my organization and there is a 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.180
 explained the agreement that the water here 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.370
 others more or equal I will tell you I arrived 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.650
 until the site comes this agreement and 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.420
 I got this agreement from me soon 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.420
 next we are going to come more 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.969
 this comes an authority 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.599
 we are already arriving more agreement let's go 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:41.989
 talking more deeper this the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:46.219
 My decision of the Wiwa people as Mom 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.950
 resentful within the project that 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:53.109
 I know what I think in this 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.260
 We need to make a record 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.920
 where it is clear that the project that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.620
 you have 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.660
 the villages of the sierra the three magicians 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.300
 who are here at this moment and the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.300
 councils agree on a project
