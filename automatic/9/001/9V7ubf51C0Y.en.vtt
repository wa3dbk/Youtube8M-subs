00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
yeah we a moog area really fast track

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.259 
yeah we a moog area really fast track
between<00:00:09.690> Saturday<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:10.740> quite<00:00:11.429> flat<00:00:11.700> that's

the finished chump before we have a left

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.070 
the finished chump before we have a left
turn<00:00:14.730> where<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.150> take<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> inside<00:00:15.839> rat

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
turn where you can take the inside rat

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230 
turn where you can take the inside rat
or<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> outside<00:00:16.580> you<00:00:17.580> pass<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> pit<00:00:18.210> lane

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
or the outside you pass the pit lane

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.599 
or the outside you pass the pit lane
like<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.170> fast<00:00:19.410> rate<00:00:19.800> which<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.310> small

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
like really fast rate which was small

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.570 
like really fast rate which was small
breaking<00:00:21.090> bump<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:22.199> hand<00:00:22.529> turn<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:23.279> of

breaking bump right hand turn out of
jump<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.390> difficult<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> make<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.439> path

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
jump really difficult to make a path

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.939 
jump really difficult to make a path

small<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.519> before<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> stop

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
small one before you have like a stop

brake<00:00:32.780> tabletop<00:00:33.780> nice<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.910> quite<00:00:35.910> fast

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
brake tabletop nice one quite fast

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
brake tabletop nice one quite fast
left-hand<00:00:36.809> turn<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> single<00:00:38.790> channel

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
left-hand turn it like a single channel

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.470 
left-hand turn it like a single channel
then<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> big<00:00:39.930> triple<00:00:40.379> apps<00:00:40.559> step<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:42.239> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
then a big triple apps step up you can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
then a big triple apps step up you can
really<00:00:42.719> tie<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> left<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really tie it on the left you have a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.779 
really tie it on the left you have a
nice<00:00:44.370> step<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.890> now<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
nice step down and now this right in you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
nice step down and now this right in you
have<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.030> three<00:00:48.390> options<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.050> inside

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
have like three options to go inside

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
have like three options to go inside
middle<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:49.980> outside<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:51.239> need<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> take<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> lot

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
middle or outside you need to take a lot

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.610 
middle or outside you need to take a lot
of<00:00:51.960> speed<00:00:52.320> before<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.340> hill<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> really

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
of speed before the hill this is really

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
of speed before the hill this is really
tight<00:00:55.860> left<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.760> deep<00:00:56.940> ruts<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
tight left and turn with deep ruts you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
tight left and turn with deep ruts you
have<00:00:57.750> another<00:00:57.960> step<00:00:58.350> down<00:00:58.760> he<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> like

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
have another step down he is like

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
have another step down he is like
difficult<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> find<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.350> breaking<00:01:01.530> point

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
difficult to find good breaking point

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600 
difficult to find good breaking point
and<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.760> again<00:01:03.000> inside<00:01:03.480> outside<00:01:04.070> some<00:01:05.070> small

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and go again inside outside some small

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539 
and go again inside outside some small
hooks<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> hill<00:01:07.159> inside<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
hooks up the hill inside you have like a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
hooks up the hill inside you have like a
small<00:01:09.000> breaking<00:01:09.390> pump<00:01:09.630> left<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> have

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
small breaking pump left then you have

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
small breaking pump left then you have
like<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.310> long<00:01:11.610> whoop<00:01:11.850> section<00:01:12.260> where<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
like a long whoop section where you can

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
like a long whoop section where you can
make<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.830> double<00:01:14.189> double<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
make like double double or you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.039 
make like double double or you can
really<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> break<00:01:16.860> inside

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
really them you break inside

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
really them you break inside
acceleration<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.259> nice<00:01:19.650> tabletop<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:21.479> one

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
acceleration like nice tabletop this one

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
acceleration like nice tabletop this one
is<00:01:21.750> difficult<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.100> watch<00:01:23.280> out

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is difficult because you to watch out

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999 
is difficult because you to watch out
you<00:01:23.580> don't<00:01:23.610> lose<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> front<00:01:24.420> coming<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you don't lose the front coming down and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
you don't lose the front coming down and
two<00:01:26.670> right-hand<00:01:27.119> turn<00:01:27.360> another<00:01:27.840> whoop

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
two right-hand turn another whoop

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.190 
two right-hand turn another whoop
section<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.509> yeah<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> stop

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
section up here yeah it's like a stop

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
section up here yeah it's like a stop
pumping<00:01:31.470> inside<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.640> left<00:01:32.939> another

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
pumping inside you can left another

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
pumping inside you can left another
stepped<00:01:34.170> away<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:34.860> double<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> hear

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
stepped away can make double or you hear

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
stepped away can make double or you hear
outside<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.750> trouble<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.890> hand

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
outside and you make trouble right hand

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.330 
outside and you make trouble right hand
turn

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
turn

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.149 
turn
nice<00:01:39.939> tabletop<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.619> take<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.859> lot<00:01:42.100> of

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
nice tabletop you can take a lot of

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.099 
nice tabletop you can take a lot of
speed<00:01:42.579> before<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:43.030> have<00:01:43.119> an<00:01:43.270> oven-like<00:01:43.600> step

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
speed before you have an oven-like step

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.399 
speed before you have an oven-like step
up<00:01:44.289> with<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.710> tabletop<00:01:45.250> lightning-fast

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
up with the tabletop lightning-fast

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039 
up with the tabletop lightning-fast
left-hand<00:01:47.409> turn<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.619> trooper<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:49.659> inside

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
left-hand turn a trooper and then inside

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.380 
left-hand turn a trooper and then inside
here<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> pig's<00:01:50.859> top<00:01:51.369> break<00:01:51.609> and<00:01:51.880> then<00:01:52.030> you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
here like a pig's top break and then you

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.510 
here like a pig's top break and then you
have<00:01:52.689> another<00:01:52.780> step<00:01:53.259> down<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.369> really

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
have another step down and it really

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.439 
have another step down and it really
fast<00:01:54.729> rate<00:01:55.090> before<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.750> again<00:01:55.959> on<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.170> finish
