what<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> saw<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.090> point<00:00:45.390> was<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
what you saw at this point was the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
what you saw at this point was the
dramatic<00:00:46.020> rise<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.489> amount<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> upsets

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
dramatic rise in the amount of upsets

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
dramatic rise in the amount of upsets
because<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.590> game<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.039> shorter<00:00:50.430> there's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
because the game was shorter there's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.270 
because the game was shorter there's
more<00:00:51.210> intense<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.890> no<00:00:52.920> downtime

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
more intense with little to no downtime

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
more intense with little to no downtime
at<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> score<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.260> those<00:00:55.440> two

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
at all and if the score of those two

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.639 
at all and if the score of those two
deuce<00:00:55.980> each<00:00:56.579> player<00:00:57.230> alternates<00:00:58.230> serves

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
deuce each player alternates serves

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:08.550 
deuce each player alternates serves
until<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.640> player<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.239> by<00:01:00.660> two<00:01:00.719> points

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.730 

so<00:01:09.560> if<00:01:10.010> someone<00:01:10.400> wants<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.140> make<00:01:12.140> five<00:01:12.410> serves

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
so if someone wants to make five serves

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.790 
so if someone wants to make five serves
or<00:01:13.130> play<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.490> game<00:01:13.610> u21<00:01:14.120> just<00:01:14.870> update<00:01:15.440> them<00:01:15.650> on
