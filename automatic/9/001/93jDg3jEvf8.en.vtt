rock through sobs I would like to say
that<00:00:20.189> number<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.060> scrambles<00:00:21.449> would<00:00:21.539> be

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that number one the scrambles would be

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.050 
that number one the scrambles would be
in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> description<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.650> number<00:00:23.189> two<00:00:23.430> that

on a certain puzzle every day this week
this<00:00:33.239> week<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:34.079> midterm<00:00:34.620> week<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> still

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this week is my midterm week but I still

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
this week is my midterm week but I still
wanted<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.059> videos<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.170> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
wanted to have videos going out so that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
wanted to have videos going out so that
is<00:00:38.250> what's<00:00:38.460> happening<00:00:38.969> they're<00:00:39.149> also<00:00:39.329> going

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is what's happening they're also going

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
is what's happening they're also going
to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.660> very<00:00:40.219> now<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> wouldn't<00:00:41.610> say<00:00:41.670> poorly<00:00:42.239> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to be very now I wouldn't say poorly but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.459 
to be very now I wouldn't say poorly but
very<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.290> edited<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.260> they're<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.350> gonna

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
very little edited so they're just gonna

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
very little edited so they're just gonna
be<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.950> simple<00:00:47.219> walk<00:00:47.489> through<00:00:47.760> saws

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
be some simple walk through saws

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
be some simple walk through saws
sometimes<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> might<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.770> three

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
sometimes it might be like three

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.290 
sometimes it might be like three
walkthrough<00:00:50.399> solves<00:00:50.610> sometimes<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> might<00:00:51.239> be

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
walkthrough solves sometimes it might be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.590 
walkthrough solves sometimes it might be
one<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.350> depends<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.699> today<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.329> going

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
one it all depends but today I'm going

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
one it all depends but today I'm going
to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.350> two<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.190> only<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to do two by two and it is only going to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.340 
to do two by two and it is only going to
be<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.420> it's<00:01:00.420> only<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.079> three

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
be on and it's only going to be three

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
be on and it's only going to be three
walked<00:01:01.649> ourselves<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:04.129> here's<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> first

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
walked ourselves so here's the first

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.880 
walked ourselves so here's the first
scramble<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.960> what<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.200> probably<00:01:10.380> do

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
scramble and what I would probably do

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.450 
scramble and what I would probably do
here<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.950> red<00:01:15.200> we've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.710> whole

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
here is the red we've got this whole

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
here is the red we've got this whole
chunk<00:01:17.820> done<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:19.290> Ortega<00:01:19.710> by<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> way

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
chunk done here I use Ortega by the way

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.660 
chunk done here I use Ortega by the way
so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.030> would<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.670> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so what I would do is go like that and I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330 
so what I would do is go like that and I
get<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.180> case<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> these

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
get this case why these two and these

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
get this case why these two and these
two<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.740> algorithm<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
two so I do that algorithm and then we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:41.200 
two so I do that algorithm and then we
have<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.579> it's<00:01:35.579> finished<00:01:37.909> next<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> have

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
have this and it's finished next we have

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
have this and it's finished next we have
this<00:01:43.159> scramble<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.350> what<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.560> probably

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
this scramble and what I would probably

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.660 
this scramble and what I would probably
do<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:49.250> green<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.399> piece

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
do here is green so we have this piece

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
do here is green so we have this piece
that<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> inserted<00:01:55.369> then<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that will be inserted then this one and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.819 
that will be inserted then this one and
we<00:01:59.700> will<00:01:59.729> get<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.240> easy<00:02:00.780> oh<00:02:01.820> ll<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.530> then<00:02:04.530> we

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
we will get an easy oh ll and then we

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.830 
we will get an easy oh ll and then we
have<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.250> case<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:05.850> which<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
have this case right here which is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.719 
have this case right here which is
probably<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.439> my<00:02:07.590> least<00:02:07.619> favorite<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.520> two

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
probably one of my least favorite on two

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.830 
probably one of my least favorite on two
by<00:02:08.879> two<00:02:10.280> then<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.520> last<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.150> have

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
by two then the last one we have

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.530 
by two then the last one we have
this<00:02:13.500> scramble<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.940> all<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.150> these<00:02:15.330> will<00:02:15.510> be

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
this scramble again all of these will be

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.070 
this scramble again all of these will be
in<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> description<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.599> let's<00:02:18.599> see<00:02:18.870> what

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
in the description and let's see what

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.370 
in the description and let's see what
we're<00:02:19.230> gonna<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:23.510> okay<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> would<00:02:25.290> do

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
we're gonna do okay so what I would do

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.910 
we're gonna do okay so what I would do
is<00:02:25.530> I'd<00:02:25.680> bring<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.130> piece<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:28.260> insert

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
is I'd bring this piece down then insert

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
is I'd bring this piece down then insert
that<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.599> get<00:02:30.810> another<00:02:31.110> easy<00:02:33.230> lll

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that one and you get another easy lll

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.770 
that one and you get another easy lll
and<00:02:34.550> then<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.910> my<00:02:36.150> least-favorite

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.400 

algorithm<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:41.040> 2x2<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:42.480> those<00:02:42.720> are<00:02:42.840> my<00:02:42.959> three

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
algorithm for 2x2 so those are my three

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.199 
algorithm for 2x2 so those are my three
very<00:02:43.769> quick<00:02:44.040> walk<00:02:44.340> through<00:02:44.370> solace<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.030> yet
