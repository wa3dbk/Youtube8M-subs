upgrade the OS on your phone most of the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.740 
upgrade the OS on your phone most of the
time<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.530> breaks<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> app<00:02:52.130> yeah<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.150> mean<00:02:53.420> at

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
time that breaks the app yeah I mean at

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330 
time that breaks the app yeah I mean at
least<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.050> not<00:02:54.140> working<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.830> way<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.160> was

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
least it's not working the way it was

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.950 
least it's not working the way it was
before<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.060> might<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.390> been<00:02:56.570> used<00:02:56.780> to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
before that you might have been used to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.110 
before that you might have been used to
until<00:02:57.350> they<00:02:57.470> make<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.830> fix<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.880> kind<00:02:59.090> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
until they make a fix and that kind of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.510 
until they make a fix and that kind of
thing<00:02:59.180> exactly<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> idea<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.860> simple<00:03:01.310> give

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
thing exactly so the idea is simple give

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.770 
thing exactly so the idea is simple give
me<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> good<00:03:01.760> example<00:03:02.270> then<00:03:02.420> what<00:03:02.540> would<00:03:02.630> be

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
me a good example then what would be

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.600 
me a good example then what would be
something<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.470> would<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.770> like<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.280> see<00:03:04.520> it
