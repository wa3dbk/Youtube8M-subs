photo viewer this is probably one of the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.800 
photo viewer this is probably one of the
more<00:02:48.050> funny<00:02:48.320> ones<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.710> pretty<00:02:49.630> frequent<00:02:50.630> member

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
more funny ones a pretty frequent member

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.990 
more funny ones a pretty frequent member
of<00:02:50.900> our<00:02:50.990> killed<00:02:51.260> data<00:02:51.620> there<00:02:51.980> being<00:02:52.310> naked

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
of our killed data there being naked

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.730 
of our killed data there being naked
which<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.300> brilliant<00:02:53.420> we<00:02:54.020> got<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> whole<00:02:54.560> bunch

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
which is brilliant we got a whole bunch

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.730 
which is brilliant we got a whole bunch
of<00:02:54.860> pixel<00:02:55.220> RT<00:02:55.460> style<00:02:55.760> ones<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:57.200> guess<00:02:57.590> it

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
think a few of these will start rolling

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.330 
think a few of these will start rolling
through<00:06:23.879> here<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.240> and<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.860> was<00:06:26.099> just<00:06:26.250> a

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
through here and and it was just a

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.589 
through here and and it was just a
really<00:06:26.370> really<00:06:26.669> cool<00:06:26.759> payoff<00:06:27.150> and<00:06:27.300> one<00:06:27.449> of<00:06:27.539> the

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
really really cool payoff and one of the

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:28.679 
really really cool payoff and one of the
nicest<00:06:27.750> sort<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.169> anniver

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:28.689
