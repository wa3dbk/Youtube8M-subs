go-to locking tuners which are a little

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160 
go-to locking tuners which are a little
bit<00:00:36.489> different<00:00:36.879> than<00:00:37.030> your<00:00:37.239> standard<00:00:37.270> locking

bit different than your standard locking

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.290 
bit different than your standard locking
tuners<00:00:38.350> because<00:00:39.250> most<00:00:39.489> locking<00:00:39.879> tuners<00:00:40.030> will

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.069 
down and I'm also going to hold the back
side<00:01:51.219> of<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.549> tail<00:01:52.119> piece<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.570> so<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:52.899> the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
side of the tail piece here so that the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.630 
side of the tail piece here so that the
ball<00:01:53.380> end<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.770> string<00:01:53.979> doesn't<00:01:54.159> go<00:01:54.340> flying

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
ball end of the string doesn't go flying

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.490 
ball end of the string doesn't go flying
out<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:55.539> worry<00:01:55.719> about<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.049> finish<00:01:56.320> here

out if you worry about the finish here

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.200 
out if you worry about the finish here
these<00:01:56.649> ball<00:01:56.890> ends<00:01:57.130> could<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.490> flying<00:01:57.789> out<00:01:58.000> at

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
these ball ends could go flying out at

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.639 
these ball ends could go flying out at
the<00:01:58.299> guitar<00:01:58.570> here<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:58.899> put<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> couple

it like this I'm going to just cut off
all<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.310> strings

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.990

once I cut them I'm going to remove this
tail<00:02:13.300> piece<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.500> will<00:02:14.590> actually<00:02:14.710> come

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
tail piece because it will actually come

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520 
tail piece because it will actually come
off<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.310> its<00:02:15.460> own<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.050> strings<00:02:17.350> are

I'll come back to that later and we'll

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.550 
I'll come back to that later and we'll
just<00:02:24.460> toss<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:24.910> strings<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.600> now<00:02:26.320> we're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
just toss these strings and now we're

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610 
just toss these strings and now we're
going<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:27.300> loosen<00:02:28.300> them<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.750> unlock<00:02:29.260> them<00:02:29.470> at

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
going to loosen them and unlock them at

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.130 
going to loosen them and unlock them at
the<00:02:29.740> headstock<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.340> we're<00:02:30.910> going<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.330> loosen

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the headstock and we're going to loosen

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.320 
the headstock and we're going to loosen
each<00:02:32.380> string<00:02:33.070> as<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.550> see<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.940> string<00:02:34.180> is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
each string as you can see the string is

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.880 
each string as you can see the string is
still<00:02:34.420> attached<00:02:34.930> every<00:02:35.320> string<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.710> still

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
still attached every string is still

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.200 
still attached every string is still
attached<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.430> tuner<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:36.910> it's

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
attached to the tuner because it's

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.990 
attached to the tuner because it's
locked<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.750> place<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.490> where<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.820> take

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
locked in place this is where we take

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.449 
locked in place this is where we take
our<00:02:40.180> penny<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.890> we'll<00:02:42.010> need<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.430> is

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
our penny and what we'll need to do is

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.370 
our penny and what we'll need to do is
you<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.030> keep<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.300> mind<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
you just have to keep in mind that the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.350 
you just have to keep in mind that the
way<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> string<00:02:44.920> tunes<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> way<00:02:46.209> it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
way the string tunes and the way it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750 
way the string tunes and the way it
wraps<00:02:46.600> around<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.170> post<00:02:47.440> you'll<00:02:48.280> notice<00:02:48.580> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
wraps around the post you'll notice that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
wraps around the post you'll notice that
on<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.090> headstock<00:02:49.600> you've<00:02:49.780> got<00:02:49.990> three<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
on this headstock you've got three and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.650 
on this headstock you've got three and
three<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.760> three<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.060> three<00:02:52.270> set<00:02:52.510> up

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
three that's a three and three set up

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.410 
three that's a three and three set up
for<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.050> tuning<00:02:53.709> keys<00:02:53.890> these<00:02:54.760> three<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.240> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
for the tuning keys these three on the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.880 
for the tuning keys these three on the
left<00:02:55.630> side<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.020> headstock<00:02:56.410> or<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> base

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
left side of the headstock or the base

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.070 
left side of the headstock or the base
side<00:02:57.130> they'll<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.270> different<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:59.050> of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
side they'll have a different way of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.900 
side they'll have a different way of
unlocking<00:02:59.800> basically<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.370> will<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
unlocking basically these will have to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.949 
unlocking basically these will have to
go<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:02.050> counterclockwise<00:03:02.860> direction<00:03:03.959> now

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
go in a counterclockwise direction now

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.600 
go in a counterclockwise direction now
when<00:03:05.170> you're<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.530> treble<00:03:05.830> side<00:03:06.100> or<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
when you're on the treble side or the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.850 
when you're on the treble side or the
right<00:03:06.970> side<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.510> headstock<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:08.620> going

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
right side of the headstock you're going

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.000 
right side of the headstock you're going
to<00:03:08.950> actually<00:03:09.400> go<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.390> clockwise<00:03:10.720> direction

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
to actually go in a clockwise direction

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.080 
to actually go in a clockwise direction
so<00:03:12.010> you're<00:03:12.130> always<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.580> unlock<00:03:12.940> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so you're always going to unlock the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.780 
so you're always going to unlock the
string<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.590> same<00:03:14.800> direction<00:03:15.100> as<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> goes

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
string in the same direction as it goes

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.090 
string in the same direction as it goes
around<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.390> tuning<00:03:16.780> key<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.830> we're<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.040> to

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
around the tuning key so we're going to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.280 
around the tuning key so we're going to
start<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.910> bass<00:03:19.060> side<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.630> we're<00:03:20.170> going

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
start with the bass side and we're going

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.620 
start with the bass side and we're going
to<00:03:20.410> unlock<00:03:20.800> these<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.090> takes<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.510> little

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
to unlock these it just takes a little

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.710 
to unlock these it just takes a little
bit<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.989> doesn't<00:03:23.230> take<00:03:23.380> much<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:24.850> just<00:03:25.030> go

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
bit it doesn't take much but we just go

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.250 
bit it doesn't take much but we just go
counterclockwise<00:03:26.230> until<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.600> loosens<00:03:29.140> up

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
counterclockwise until that loosens up

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.990 
counterclockwise until that loosens up
once<00:03:29.739> you've<00:03:29.890> got<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.190> loose<00:03:30.430> you're<00:03:30.790> able

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
once you've got that loose you're able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.259 
once you've got that loose you're able
to<00:03:31.180> actually<00:03:31.989> see<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.160> post<00:03:33.910> spin

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
to actually see that the post spin

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.960 
to actually see that the post spin
around<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> string<00:03:35.320> comes<00:03:35.560> right<00:03:35.860> out<00:03:35.970> so

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
around and the string comes right out so

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.420 
around and the string comes right out so
we're<00:03:37.060> going<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> do<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.510> with<00:03:37.720> these<00:03:38.430> pull

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
we're going to do that with these pull

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.620 
we're going to do that with these pull
the<00:03:39.519> strings<00:03:39.790> out<00:03:39.910> carefully<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:40.540> don't

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
the strings out carefully so we don't

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.360 
the strings out carefully so we don't
scratch<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.320> headstock<00:03:41.680> once<00:03:41.920> again<00:03:42.190> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
scratch the headstock once again and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.160 
scratch the headstock once again and
what<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> like<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.450> when<00:03:43.600> I'm<00:03:43.720> done<00:03:43.930> I'll

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
what I like to do is when I'm done I'll

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.590 
what I like to do is when I'm done I'll
release<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.580> bit<00:03:45.700> more<00:03:45.880> I'm

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
release it just a little bit more I'm

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.080

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
little bit so it has enough room to fit

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.890

out once these strings are out I'll just
wrap<00:04:02.500> them<00:04:02.680> up<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.100> they<00:04:03.220> don't<00:04:03.430> get<00:04:04.090> all<00:04:04.209> over

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
working my way up to the high e or the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.930 
working my way up to the high e or the
plain<00:05:00.930> strings<00:05:01.349> just<00:05:01.770> make<00:05:01.979> sure<00:05:02.340> when<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:02.729> do

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
plain strings just make sure when you do

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.360 
plain strings just make sure when you do
it<00:05:03.090> this<00:05:03.270> way<00:05:03.539> that<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.259> make<00:05:04.830> sure<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:05.129> are

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
it this way that you make sure you are

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.369 
it this way that you make sure you are
using<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:06.180> correct<00:05:06.449> gauge<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.900> string<00:05:07.139> you

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
using the correct gauge of string you

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.589 
using the correct gauge of string you
can<00:05:07.409> basically<00:05:07.919> know<00:05:08.129> which<00:05:08.370> gauge<00:05:08.699> a<00:05:09.060> string

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
can basically know which gauge a string

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.800 
can basically know which gauge a string
is<00:05:09.750> by<00:05:09.900> feeling<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.979> thickness<00:05:11.400> okay<00:05:12.060> I've

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
is by feeling the thickness okay I've

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.990 
is by feeling the thickness okay I've
got<00:05:13.050> them<00:05:13.199> all<00:05:13.319> in<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:14.159> tailpiece<00:05:14.550> it's<00:05:14.759> a<00:05:14.849> lot

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
got them all in the tailpiece it's a lot

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.369 
got them all in the tailpiece it's a lot
easier<00:05:15.180> for<00:05:15.419> me<00:05:15.479> now<00:05:15.659> to<00:05:15.690> put<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.199> the

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
easier for me now to put it on the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.379 
easier for me now to put it on the
guitar<00:05:16.469> another<00:05:17.279> reason<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.729> do<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.150> way

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
guitar another reason I do it this way

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.409 
guitar another reason I do it this way
is<00:05:18.659> because<00:05:19.500> if<00:05:20.009> I<00:05:20.310> had<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.699> on<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.090> guitar

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
is because if I had this on the guitar

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.809 
is because if I had this on the guitar
without<00:05:21.659> the<00:05:21.990> string<00:05:22.259> tension<00:05:22.529> it<00:05:23.219> may<00:05:23.430> tend

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
without the string tension it may tend

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.909 
without the string tension it may tend
to<00:05:23.879> fall<00:05:24.120> off<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.539> guitar<00:05:24.810> like<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.650> you

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
to fall off the guitar like this and you

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.320 
to fall off the guitar like this and you
may<00:05:26.039> also<00:05:26.219> scratch<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.759> guitar<00:05:27.029> when<00:05:27.210> you're

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
may also scratch a guitar when you're

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.149 
may also scratch a guitar when you're
putting<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.599> string<00:05:27.810> on<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.229> this<00:05:28.949> is<00:05:29.039> why<00:05:29.129> I

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
putting the string on so this is why I

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.920 
putting the string on so this is why I
do<00:05:29.279> it<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.580> way<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:30.270> once<00:05:30.449> it's<00:05:30.599> on<00:05:30.690> there

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
do it this way and once it's on there

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.390 
do it this way and once it's on there
and<00:05:31.139> you<00:05:31.199> have<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.680> strings<00:05:31.979> here<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.310> your

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
and you have the strings here and your

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.519 
and you have the strings here and your
other<00:05:32.520> hand<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.449> can<00:05:33.599> pull<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.080> tight<00:05:34.259> it's

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
other hand you can pull it tight it's

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:35.899 
other hand you can pull it tight it's
not<00:05:34.650> going<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.830> fall<00:05:34.949> off<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.190> guitar<00:05:35.520> now<00:05:35.849> we

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
not going to fall off the guitar now we

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.430 
not going to fall off the guitar now we
have<00:05:36.089> the<00:05:36.210> strings<00:05:36.509> on<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.810> tailpiece<00:05:37.199> and

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
have the strings on the tailpiece and

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.529 
have the strings on the tailpiece and
over<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> bridge<00:05:37.889> and<00:05:38.310> we're<00:05:38.639> ready<00:05:38.849> to<00:05:38.940> put

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
over the bridge and we're ready to put

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.909 
over the bridge and we're ready to put
them<00:05:39.719> onto<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.110> headstock<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:40.680> I'm<00:05:40.770> going<00:05:40.889> to

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
them onto the headstock so I'm going to

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.439 
them onto the headstock so I'm going to
show<00:05:41.069> you<00:05:41.129> how<00:05:41.310> to<00:05:41.339> put<00:05:41.639> them<00:05:41.789> through<00:05:41.819> the

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
show you how to put them through the

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.749 
show you how to put them through the
tuning<00:05:43.139> keys<00:05:43.319> now<00:05:43.529> go<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.830> locking<00:05:44.580> tuners

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
tuning keys now go to locking tuners

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.999 
tuning keys now go to locking tuners
have<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.479> specific<00:05:46.050> way<00:05:46.199> of<00:05:46.229> tuning<00:05:46.800> them<00:05:46.889> up

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
have a specific way of tuning them up

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.129 
have a specific way of tuning them up
you<00:05:47.190> don't<00:05:47.339> need<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.759> lock<00:05:48.360> down<00:05:48.629> on<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
you don't need to lock down on the

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.749 
you don't need to lock down on the
tuners<00:05:49.740> from<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.009> backside<00:05:50.370> like<00:05:50.580> other

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
tuners from the backside like other

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.999 
tuners from the backside like other
locking<00:05:51.330> tuners<00:05:51.479> will<00:05:51.810> do<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.589> basically<00:05:52.770> what

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
locking tuners will do so basically what

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.589 
locking tuners will do so basically what
you<00:05:53.099> want<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.310> do<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.699> send<00:05:54.180> each<00:05:54.270> string

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
you want to do is send each string

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.779 
you want to do is send each string
through<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.199> thread<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.680> through<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.069> post

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
through and thread it through the post

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.189 
through and thread it through the post
and<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.830> tuner<00:05:59.159> will<00:05:59.310> actually<00:05:59.610> lock<00:05:59.819> down

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
and the tuner will actually lock down

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.089 
and the tuner will actually lock down
automatically<00:06:01.199> what<00:06:01.529> I'm<00:06:01.620> going<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.770> do<00:06:01.889> here

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
automatically what I'm going to do here

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.980 
automatically what I'm going to do here
is<00:06:02.159> I'm<00:06:02.219> going<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.370> use<00:06:02.490> my<00:06:02.580> power<00:06:02.789> driver<00:06:03.240> with

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
is I'm going to use my power driver with

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.589 
is I'm going to use my power driver with
my<00:06:04.710> string<00:06:05.009> winder<00:06:05.190> attachment<00:06:05.879> and<00:06:06.210> I'm<00:06:06.509> just

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
my string winder attachment and I'm just

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.219 
my string winder attachment and I'm just
going<00:06:06.719> to<00:06:06.810> hold<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.080> string<00:06:07.379> tight<00:06:09.169> now<00:06:10.169> you

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
going to hold the string tight now you

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.769 
going to hold the string tight now you
can<00:06:10.409> see<00:06:10.650> once<00:06:10.919> once<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.610> post<00:06:12.000> gets<00:06:12.539> all<00:06:12.690> the

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
can see once once that post gets all the

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:14.439 
can see once once that post gets all the
way<00:06:12.870> down<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:13.349> threads<00:06:13.620> down<00:06:13.770> onto<00:06:14.129> the<00:06:14.219> key

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
way down and threads down onto the key

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.760 
way down and threads down onto the key
locks<00:06:15.449> down<00:06:15.659> on<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.900> string<00:06:16.110> so<00:06:16.349> it<00:06:16.469> starts

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
locks down on the string so it starts

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.700 
locks down on the string so it starts
automatically<00:06:17.699> tuning<00:06:18.509> and<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:19.379> string<00:06:19.589> is

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
automatically tuning and the string is

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.769 
automatically tuning and the string is
now<00:06:19.830> locked<00:06:20.099> I'm<00:06:21.089> going<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.300> do<00:06:21.419> that<00:06:21.599> for

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
now locked I'm going to do that for

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.659 
now locked I'm going to do that for
every<00:06:21.960> string<00:06:22.229> now<00:06:22.379> depending<00:06:23.129> on<00:06:23.219> how<00:06:23.430> much

every string now depending on how much

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.269 
every string now depending on how much
you<00:06:23.940> loosened<00:06:24.419> each<00:06:24.539> string<00:06:25.259> posts<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:25.860> could

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
you loosened each string posts it could

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.769 
you loosened each string posts it could
take<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.580> little<00:06:26.789> bit<00:06:27.029> more<00:06:27.419> than<00:06:27.539> a<00:06:27.569> couple

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
take a little bit more than a couple

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.990 
take a little bit more than a couple
whines<00:06:28.110> or<00:06:28.440> or<00:06:28.860> less<00:06:29.099> depending<00:06:29.610> on<00:06:29.669> how<00:06:29.849> much

you<00:06:30.149> loosened<00:06:30.539> it<00:06:30.630> so<00:06:30.870> that<00:06:31.169> first<00:06:31.380> one<00:06:31.589> I<00:06:31.620> did

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:31.709 
you loosened it so that first one I did

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:33.150 
you loosened it so that first one I did
was<00:06:31.889> a<00:06:32.339> little<00:06:33.000> bit

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
was a little bit

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.650 
was a little bit
looser<00:06:33.460> than<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.730> other<00:06:33.850> ones<00:06:34.090> and<00:06:34.420> we'll<00:06:34.510> see

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
looser than the other ones and we'll see

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.130 
looser than the other ones and we'll see
how<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:34.810> other<00:06:34.990> ones<00:06:35.140> work<00:06:35.320> here<00:06:36.900> it's<00:06:37.900> a<00:06:37.990> lot

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
how the other ones work here it's a lot

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.350 
how the other ones work here it's a lot
closer<00:06:38.410> now<00:06:38.830> when<00:06:38.980> we<00:06:39.070> move<00:06:39.280> around<00:06:39.550> to<00:06:39.730> the

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
closer now when we move around to the

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.120 
closer now when we move around to the
treble<00:06:40.720> side<00:06:40.900> we're<00:06:41.380> dealing<00:06:41.710> with<00:06:41.740> plain

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
treble side we're dealing with plain

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.010 
treble side we're dealing with plain
strings<00:06:42.520> here<00:06:42.850> should<00:06:43.270> go<00:06:43.480> in<00:06:43.630> a<00:06:43.720> little<00:06:43.840> bit

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
strings here should go in a little bit

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.620 
strings here should go in a little bit
easier<00:06:44.560> than<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:44.770> wild<00:06:45.580> strings<00:06:45.880> but<00:06:46.210> same

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
easier than the wild strings but same

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.690 
easier than the wild strings but same
method<00:06:47.080> and<00:06:47.260> we're<00:06:47.740> going<00:06:47.950> to<00:06:48.010> hold<00:06:48.550> the

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
method and we're going to hold the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.910 
method and we're going to hold the
string<00:06:48.970> like<00:06:49.150> this<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:50.640> turn<00:06:51.640> up<00:06:51.850> guitar

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920

string and started to tune it tuning the
pitch<00:07:06.010> up<00:07:06.300> so<00:07:07.300> we<00:07:07.480> know<00:07:07.630> that<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.900> strings<00:07:08.170> are

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
pitch up so we know that the strings are

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.370 
pitch up so we know that the strings are
locked<00:07:08.500> down<00:07:08.620> now<00:07:09.120> now<00:07:10.120> I'm<00:07:10.270> going<00:07:10.540> to<00:07:10.720> cut<00:07:11.230> the

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
locked down now now I'm going to cut the

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.020 
locked down now now I'm going to cut the
strings<00:07:11.650> off<00:07:11.830> so<00:07:12.340> that<00:07:12.490> they're<00:07:12.640> not<00:07:12.730> in<00:07:12.910> the

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
strings off so that they're not in the

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.000 
strings off so that they're not in the
way<00:07:13.150> what<00:07:13.450> I<00:07:13.480> like<00:07:13.660> to<00:07:13.780> do<00:07:13.930> is<00:07:14.170> I<00:07:14.500> like<00:07:14.680> to<00:07:14.740> bend

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
way what I like to do is I like to bend

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.860 
way what I like to do is I like to bend
each<00:07:15.220> string<00:07:15.520> down<00:07:15.730> so<00:07:16.390> it's<00:07:16.510> not<00:07:16.600> sticking

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
each string down so it's not sticking

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.140 
each string down so it's not sticking
straight<00:07:17.230> out<00:07:17.290> and<00:07:17.740> I'll<00:07:18.010> take<00:07:18.250> my<00:07:18.400> string

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
straight out and I'll take my string

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.700 
straight out and I'll take my string
cutters<00:07:19.480> and<00:07:19.750> I'll<00:07:19.870> get<00:07:20.020> in<00:07:20.110> there<00:07:20.200> very<00:07:20.470> close

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
cutters and I'll get in there very close

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.370 
cutters and I'll get in there very close
and<00:07:21.040> cut<00:07:21.730> every<00:07:22.210> string<00:07:22.480> as<00:07:22.690> close<00:07:23.170> as

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
and cut every string as close as

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.920 
and cut every string as close as
possible<00:07:23.410> to<00:07:24.130> that<00:07:24.160> string<00:07:25.060> post<00:07:25.300> you<00:07:25.750> don't

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
possible to that string post you don't

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.120 
possible to that string post you don't
have<00:07:26.020> to<00:07:26.140> worry<00:07:26.380> about<00:07:26.440> cutting<00:07:26.890> it<00:07:26.980> too<00:07:27.100> close

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
have to worry about cutting it too close

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.490 
have to worry about cutting it too close
because<00:07:27.670> it's<00:07:27.790> already<00:07:28.060> locked<00:07:28.300> inside<00:07:28.690> that

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
because it's already locked inside that

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.740 
because it's already locked inside that
shaft<00:07:29.770> do<00:07:30.520> the<00:07:30.640> same<00:07:30.850> thing<00:07:31.060> here<00:07:31.360> and<00:07:31.540> bend

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
shaft do the same thing here and bend

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.580 
shaft do the same thing here and bend
these<00:07:31.870> down<00:07:32.110> this<00:07:32.680> prevents<00:07:33.220> the<00:07:33.520> string<00:07:33.820> from

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.590 
these down this prevents the string from

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.080 
these down this prevents the string from
poking<00:07:35.590> me<00:07:35.710> if<00:07:36.220> you<00:07:36.370> leave<00:07:36.520> the<00:07:36.640> string<00:07:36.880> very

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
poking me if you leave the string very

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.870 
poking me if you leave the string very
long<00:07:37.300> like<00:07:37.570> this<00:07:37.750> it<00:07:38.620> could<00:07:38.770> poke<00:07:39.040> you<00:07:39.190> and<00:07:39.250> you

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
long like this it could poke you and you

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.310 
long like this it could poke you and you
don't<00:07:40.060> want<00:07:40.210> that<00:07:40.330> to<00:07:40.420> happen<00:07:40.570> so<00:07:40.870> I<00:07:41.050> bend

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:41.320 
don't want that to happen so I bend

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.200 
don't want that to happen so I bend
these<00:07:41.470> down<00:07:41.740> and<00:07:42.040> cut<00:07:42.340> them<00:07:42.460> off<00:07:42.610> nice<00:07:42.970> and

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
these down and cut them off nice and

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.320 
these down and cut them off nice and
close<00:07:43.690> it<00:07:44.410> looks<00:07:44.650> neat<00:07:44.890> and<00:07:45.040> it<00:07:45.670> also<00:07:45.820> serves<00:07:46.210> a

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330 
close it looks neat and it also serves a

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330 
close it looks neat and it also serves a
purpose<00:07:46.540> alright<00:07:47.320> we've<00:07:47.530> put<00:07:47.800> a<00:07:47.830> whole<00:07:48.130> new
