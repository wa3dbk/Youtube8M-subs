00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.960
 Hello and Felix today I want 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.530
 show a game called world racing 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.300
 2 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.050
 this game is higher than 2005 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.520
 popular, it is very special and not 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.040
 used and now is not particularly 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.380
 enjoys but do not know i saw the video 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.190
 Online in this game 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.580
 drift shaft and so I downloaded myself and 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.309
 very hard to go download it well, all the same 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.239
 found the ram you downloaded now I go 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.660
 free ride 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.730
 now a short race here as you can see well 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.730
 not very much but cities anyway 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.930
 a lot of cars such from the standard but I 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 I installed the same newer machine and now I want 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.700
 podriftovat little hour can someone 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.170
 and not taxed if you want well of course 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.379
 I will not scatter tons of sug 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.910
 You can find yourself do not know the name here 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.850
 I 'll throw off the rasengan and I'll throw it off to you 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.729
 fashion link video 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.610
 this game so now a little sound that 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.580
 pain and that burn anyway though on 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.490
 minimally the bartender is still something 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.770
 loud 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.399
 here in this game there are several types 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.420
 there is on stand-alone machine weighs 1 cao on 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.340
 there are no simple ones, that is, we change with the c button 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.399
 Here is how you see it is generally excellent what 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.830
 you can twist the steering wheel in general 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.500
 This game can be played not only on 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.330
 the keyboard but also on the joystick and on the steering wheel I 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.420
 wanted to play on a wheel well, I do not 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.789
 It will be very convenient to do so I am so 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.090
 I do not know how they did it of course 2005 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.119
 the year is still what it is released but here 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.190
 dashboard works as you can see 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.979
 what to jump right off my non-working 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.340
 tass picture gearbox and not 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.770
 switches but so not important to find 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.109
 here are a few kinds there is then a button in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.140
 she answers too look back a 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:13.140
 to make a screenshot we may not know 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.540
 go up and down 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.959
 I know left right you can watch to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.750
 take a screenshot so come back now 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.120
 back all but i want to paint a little bit 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.099
 and show how it all looks at all 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.739
 the car in the city has to teach them a little 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.440
 trudge here one to the music over 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.209
 the capital is here boats and all garbage 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.720
 such and this is how you can first like 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.170
 usually unsuccessful grandson noticed in a skid 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.799
 is well even possible 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.290
 awesome video shoot it I do not know much 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.980
 any garbage for this game from different 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.700
 I don’t know cards to carry missions, but who are they 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.560
 need in principle a lot of cars improvement 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.220
 graphics such as linkedin people 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.720
 despite me and so ok 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.340
 for then in the thousand and fifth year it's all the same 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 normally plays such a tick 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.569
 at all here I had a speedometer I chose 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.180
 so you do not record video so nothing 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.790
 it didn't hurt then everything is great what you 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.340
 see on top 2 I have a dummy card then 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.310
 I, too, can run just when it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.310
 single player just went like this to become 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.269
 such a race and I was uncomfortable crash not 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.280
 knew where to go that's how easy it is and 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.950
 I turn a little bit now, press the space bar and 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.989
 slowly under pressure account all the gas is not 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.720
 our background is something that is the car itself 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.489
 drifting 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.349
 damage but these 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.260
 machines they are awesome at all 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.220
 everything is so bad this wheels can fall away 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.889
 can be on wood this all cafes of course 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.260
 machines different control will be on 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.019
 side because you install but 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.349
 I have a 400 and when you brake and 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.870
 no matter how much it slows down 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.750
 mending and refueling mending machine 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.690
 refueling is not x by the way there is no and here too 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.420
 there is 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.910
 Only the shift button is pressed on this 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.840
 I don’t have any car animation 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.140
 exhaust pipe goes 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.650
 nitrogen say so oh well it's all 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.690
 garbage on this machine here I do not know, but I 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.300
 I 'll take off the site where she is that car of hers 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.150
 find a not very heavy lexus she is there in 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.820
 principle selling cars there is a lot there 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.120
 there gelendvageny you for all sorts of different 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.510
 facts from this did not notice the airship 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.510
 derweiss 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.580
 learn to drift it is not too hard 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.200
 there will be even a little steamed operatives 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.190
 but then got a taste and and generally 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.580
 excellent on standard machines 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.260
 you can also drift well there is no drift 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.030
 very speed comes at once 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 there on these machines on standard too 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.280
 I didn’t really like very quickly 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.840
 who are very fast on their management 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.710
 generally terribly empty you can't 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.260
 turn almost never necessary 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.060
 slow down and quietly go to 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.130
 Drift is generally excellent you can do here 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.210
 see the cars of course comes to me already 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.000
 unreal 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.830
 a blast but still it's very cool and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.800
 looks very nice 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.930
 still i'm not even cortex body now 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.150
 I will show the Miami filling card 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.930
 Most of all I don’t know why under 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.980
 who have 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.169
 Egypt Italy you don't know what it is 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.680
 I live on someone I still give you 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:42.040
 show another car about what let's vazik 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.290
 show of course on it we harder 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.580
 drift what she reads through hell 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.290
 Tanos well, I will say control 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.460
 the speed is a little bit better and 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.419
 it slows down even a little worse 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.150
 view from 5 years 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.380
 otsadny generally now show you later 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:06.960
 Salon under the machine itself 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.750
 I'll show you such a driver sitting in 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.380
 Suit outside not at all the same 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.700
 forza 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.840
 I helped that there is such a vazik 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:21.660
 tuned vaz 2114 so now 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.760
 return first-person view 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:30.150
 does not know and some general racing 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.110
 the car is already so here they are here too 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.300
 nitrogen can not be seen 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.120
 but there is a husband and a model on which there is 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.330
 this one is visible 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.510
 the suspension in this car is very low 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.830
 for drift the most I think even though she 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.870
 right constantly flies 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:50.370
