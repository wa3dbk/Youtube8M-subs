00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.650

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.800
hi I'm Kelsey mays for cars.com we're at
the 2013 new york international auto

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.570
show with he has all new next generation
soul a vehicle that Kia promises

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.939
delivers more room a lot more upscale
features and better drivability in the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.710
same boxy package

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.869
let's get right to it the new soul has
very boxy lines still like its

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.920
predecessor styling cues a lot of them
followed his tracks your concept which

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
was introduced in 2012 that was another
boxy looking car

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
it was supposed to have styling themes
that were similar to a bulldog

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
definitely new Kia wasn't going to
accept any shih tzu

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.160
after that he says the new soul rides a
chassis that is longer wider and stiffer

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.330
than before

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.470
overall structural rigidity is up about
thirty percent but dimensions haven't

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.580
changed all that much

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.060
wheelbase up about an inch with up about
half an inch

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.680
now you've seen the LED light accents up
front and back you've got continuous

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
light pipes now that frame the rear
taillights kind of a cool look

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.650
especially as it's driving away

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.710
definitely going to be very iconic let's
check out the cargo area

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
he says the hatch opening is about two
and a half inches wider than before and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.250
there's about 25 cubic feet of cargo
room here

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
that's a reasonably good number there's
a lot of space here if you open up the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.840
storage well kinda nice that they've got
this partition here because then you can

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
fold down the seats have a flat cargo
floor or you can have more height right

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.409
here if you open this up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
overall a lot better quality than before
you've got padding and important areas

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.440
where your arms and elbows fall even
along the dashboard you've got a vinyl

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.950
stitched vinyl top here atop the
instruments

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
even things like the headliner a lot
better than before

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
trim levels include the base the plus
and the exclaim souls

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.430
if you get up to the top trends you get
a ton of available features now things

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.780
like a panoramic moonroof heated and
ventilated seats for the front seats

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.870
heated steering wheel a power driver's
seat

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.510
definitely a ton of features there still
some features from the old soul carry

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.430
over things

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
like rings around the door speakers that
be along to music

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.379
we've always found that those work best
with bad music so cue up the nickelback

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.939
or creed or 30 seconds to mars or Chingy

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.859
one thing about boxy hatchbacks is that
they tend to preserve rear headroom and

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.609
that's definitely true in the soul
Headroom is excellent here like rooms

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.989
pretty good too

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.560
that's where i was set to drive home
about six feet tall seats it's nice and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.939
high off the ground so your knees are
dangling kind of elevated up in the air

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.269
some amenities here for backseat
passengers who have even got heated

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.159
seats with two stages back here

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:02.090
pretty nice for a compact hatchback last
Soul was a peculiar little car that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.250
turned out to be very popular for kia

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.450
its successor comes on sale this fall
there's no reason not to believe that it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.209
can't follow up on the first generations
sales success
