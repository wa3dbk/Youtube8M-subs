saw<00:00:07.799> online<00:00:08.150> we're<00:00:09.150> testing<00:00:09.570> now<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:10.050> seemed

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
saw online we're testing now it seemed

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.509 
saw online we're testing now it seemed
pretty<00:00:10.380> simple<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:10.950> by<00:00:11.300> mainline<00:00:12.300> brewers<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
pretty simple as by mainline brewers I

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.499 
pretty simple as by mainline brewers I
forget<00:00:14.519> where<00:00:14.670> they're<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.330> seemed

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
forget where they're out but it seemed

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.910 
forget where they're out but it seemed
like<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.690> very<00:00:15.900> straightforward<00:00:16.139> thing<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
like a very straightforward thing and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.790 
like a very straightforward thing and
since<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.279> always<00:00:17.460> looking<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.800> candy

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
since I'm always looking it's a candy

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380 
since I'm always looking it's a candy
sugar<00:00:20.039> seeing<00:00:20.520> how<00:00:20.640> expensive<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
sugar seeing how expensive it is I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.269 
sugar seeing how expensive it is I
figured<00:00:21.750> I'll<00:00:21.869> try<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.140> myself<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.920> seems<00:00:23.070> very

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
figured I'll try it myself it seems very

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.750 
figured I'll try it myself it seems very
simple

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

temperature<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
temperature you can see that the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
temperature you can see that the
temperature<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:57.500> Wow<00:00:58.530> let<00:00:58.739> me<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
temperature there Wow let me see if I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939 
temperature there Wow let me see if I
can<00:00:59.280> focus<00:01:00.109> it's<00:01:01.109> pretty<00:01:01.320> pretty<00:01:01.710> high<00:01:01.920> up

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
can focus it's pretty pretty high up

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.630 
can focus it's pretty pretty high up
there<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.239> below<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.799> 270<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.979> can't

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
there it's right below to 270 I can't

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
there it's right below to 270 I can't
really<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.650> 270<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.710> I'm

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
really see it too well but 270 and I'm

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
really see it too well but 270 and I'm
maintaining<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
maintaining that and you can see that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
maintaining that and you can see that
it's<00:01:10.680> starting<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> change<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> nice<00:01:11.520> golden

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it's starting to change a nice golden

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's starting to change a nice golden
color<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.409> figure<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
color and I figure it's gonna get a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.550 
color and I figure it's gonna get a
little<00:01:14.220> bit<00:01:14.369> darker<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.259> but<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
little bit darker here but I'm just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.770 
little bit darker here but I'm just
letting<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.330> letting<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.630> its

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
letting it go and letting it do its

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.330 
letting it go and letting it do its
thing<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.320> started<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:20.479> 7:25<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.650> 7:40
