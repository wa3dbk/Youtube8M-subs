00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
my hairline that's because I started a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
my hairline that's because I started a
look<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> didn't<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.670> ended<00:00:35.880> up

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
look that I didn't like and I ended up

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
look that I didn't like and I ended up
taking<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.510> next<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.079> use<00:00:37.110> graftobian<00:00:37.770> red

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
taking it off next I use graftobian red

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
taking it off next I use graftobian red
face<00:00:38.489> paint<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> paint<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> peppermint

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

swirls<00:00:40.050> around<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.440> eyes<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.950> found<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
swirls around the eyes I found that it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
swirls around the eyes I found that it
was<00:00:41.760> easier<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> paint<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> red<00:00:42.930> stripes

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
was easier to paint the red stripes

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
was easier to paint the red stripes
first<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.950> area<00:00:44.309> than<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.000> paint

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
first in this area than it is to paint

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
first in this area than it is to paint
the<00:00:45.329> White<00:00:45.480> Stripes<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.800> gives

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the White Stripes first it just gives

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
the White Stripes first it just gives
you<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.340> idea<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:48.030> everything<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you a better idea of where everything is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
you a better idea of where everything is
going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.140> placed<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.190> white

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
going to be placed you can use a white

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
going to be placed you can use a white
eyeliner<00:00:50.730> pencil<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.780> trace<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.170> everything

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
eyeliner pencil to trace out everything

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
eyeliner pencil to trace out everything
first<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> didn't<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
first but I didn't do this because I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
first but I didn't do this because I
didn't<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> sit<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.719> doing<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
didn't want to sit down doing that and I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
didn't want to sit down doing that and I
don't<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> patience<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
don't have the patience for that and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
don't have the patience for that and
then<00:00:57.660> paint<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.079> swirl<00:00:58.379> shape<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.309> nose

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
then paint a swirl shape around my nose

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
then paint a swirl shape around my nose
and<00:00:59.820> outline<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.420> mouth<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.840> decided<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> paint

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and outline my mouth I decided to paint

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
and outline my mouth I decided to paint
on<00:01:01.800> some<00:01:02.100> big<00:01:02.370> over-the-top<00:01:02.820> lips<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
on some big over-the-top lips and as you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
on some big over-the-top lips and as you
can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.739> didn't<00:01:05.129> bring<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> red<00:01:05.729> stripes

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can see I didn't bring the red stripes

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
can see I didn't bring the red stripes
all<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.659> down<00:01:06.930> onto<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.650> eyes<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> that's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
all the way down onto my eyes and that's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.679 
all the way down onto my eyes and that's
because<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.520> ended<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:08.909> painting<00:01:09.210> eyes<00:01:09.450> on

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
because I ended up painting eyes on

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
because I ended up painting eyes on
because<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.580> cosmetic

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because I don't like to use cosmetic

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
because I don't like to use cosmetic
context<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.420> they're<00:01:12.540> bad<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.869> guys

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
context because they're bad for you guys

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
context because they're bad for you guys
and<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.290> top<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.860> can't<00:01:14.130> even<00:01:14.250> give

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and on top of that I can't even give

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.420 
and on top of that I can't even give
them<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:15.060> eyes<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> ended<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.220> using

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
them in my eyes so I ended up using

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
them in my eyes so I ended up using
graph<00:01:17.790> Tobin's<00:01:18.330> black<00:01:18.630> face<00:01:18.960> paint<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
graph Tobin's black face paint to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.190 
graph Tobin's black face paint to
outline<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.830> eye<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.460> paint<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.570> pupil<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
outline my eye and paint on a pupil and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
outline my eye and paint on a pupil and
I<00:01:22.619> didn't<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> initial<00:01:23.850> design<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I didn't like the initial design I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
I didn't like the initial design I
painted<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:25.680> over<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
painted so I'm not going to go over that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
painted so I'm not going to go over that
I'm<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> skip<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.540> now

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I'm just going to skip it for right now

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.310 
I'm just going to skip it for right now
once<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.530> had<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.390> outlined<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
once I had the I outlined and all the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010
