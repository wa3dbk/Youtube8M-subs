00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you have a large variety of acorn trees

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.919 
you have a large variety of acorn trees
of<00:00:11.550> oak<00:00:12.000> trees<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.300> produce<00:00:12.540> different

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
of oak trees that produce different

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.169 
of oak trees that produce different
kinds<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.110> acorns<00:00:13.559> almost<00:00:14.519> all<00:00:14.639> acorns<00:00:15.089> are

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
kinds of acorns almost all acorns are

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.230 
kinds of acorns almost all acorns are
edible<00:00:15.800> typically<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.039> whiter<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.730> Acorn

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
edible typically the whiter the Acorn

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500 
edible typically the whiter the Acorn
the<00:00:18.539> less<00:00:19.529> tannin<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> more<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the less tannin is in it so the more the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
the less tannin is in it so the more the
less<00:00:21.660> bitter<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.710> eat<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:22.949> just

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
less bitter it is you can eat them just

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
less bitter it is you can eat them just
straight<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.720> call<00:00:24.960> cow<00:00:25.320> acorns

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
straight with what we call cow acorns

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.470 
straight with what we call cow acorns
but<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> think<00:00:26.580> really<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> real<00:00:27.090> name<00:00:27.269> for

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
but I think really the real name for

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.820 
but I think really the real name for
them<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> white<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> corner<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> swamp

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.630 
how to make in another video see this
one<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:21.300> good<00:02:24.030> no<00:02:25.030> worms<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.800> red<00:02:26.980> color<00:02:27.250> in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
one is good no worms the red color in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550 
one is good no worms the red color in
the<00:02:27.940> darker<00:02:28.390> acorns<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.080> inside<00:02:29.410> will<00:02:29.530> be

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the darker acorns the inside will be

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.900 
the darker acorns the inside will be
more<00:02:29.860> red<00:02:30.100> that's<00:02:30.310> because<00:02:30.519> they<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.730> more

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
more red that's because they have more

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.580 
more red that's because they have more
tan<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.360> that's<00:02:31.510> actually<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.050> process

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
tan and that's actually what you process

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.110 
tan and that's actually what you process
out<00:02:32.769> but<00:02:32.980> these<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.580> little<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.970> don't

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
out but these have so little you don't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
is that the kind you know take a look at

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.900 
is that the kind you know take a look at
the<00:02:45.820> content<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.010> porn<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.520> spotting

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
the content this is a porn is spotting

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.200 
the content this is a porn is spotting
directory<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.830> tree<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.400> swamp<00:02:57.730> oak<00:02:57.940> and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
directory this tree is a swamp oak and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.190 
directory this tree is a swamp oak and
these<00:02:59.020> are<00:02:59.700> much<00:03:00.700> sweeter<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.330> bit<00:03:01.570> bigger

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
these are much sweeter and bit bigger

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:16.680 
these are much sweeter and bit bigger
than<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> other<00:03:02.710> acorns<00:03:03.520> Tuppy<00:03:15.450> I'll<00:03:16.450> show

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
than the other acorns Tuppy I'll show

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.370 
than the other acorns Tuppy I'll show
you<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:16.990> these<00:03:17.140> look<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.440> you'll<00:03:17.800> see<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you what these look like you'll see the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.330 
you what these look like you'll see the
difference

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.670 

okay<00:03:31.340> if<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.030> notice<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:33.080> come<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.350> close<00:03:33.530> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
okay if you notice you come in close you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.860 
okay if you notice you come in close you
can<00:03:33.800> see<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.700> meat<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.090> these<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> lot

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
can see the meat on these is a lot

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.770 
can see the meat on these is a lot
lighter<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.910> other<00:03:38.030> ones<00:03:38.300> because

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
lighter then on the other ones because

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.330 
lighter then on the other ones because
that's<00:03:39.110> less<00:03:39.290> tannin<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:39.830> that's<00:03:40.130> why<00:03:40.280> these

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
that's less tannin and that's why these

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.640 
that's less tannin and that's why these
are<00:03:40.670> sweeter<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.810> much<00:03:41.960> cleaner<00:03:42.320> nut

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
are sweeter it's so much cleaner nut

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.650 
are sweeter it's so much cleaner nut
there's<00:03:43.280> more<00:03:43.520> meat<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.120> better<00:03:44.360> for

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
there's more meat so it's better for

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.110 
there's more meat so it's better for
cooking<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.710> problem<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.280> with<00:03:46.520> this

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
cooking the problem is with this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.180 
cooking the problem is with this
particular<00:03:47.450> kind<00:03:47.960> of<00:03:48.080> tree<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.770> growing

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
particular kind of tree the growing

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.910 
particular kind of tree the growing
cycle<00:03:49.610> on<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.060> goes<00:03:50.690> through<00:03:50.930> two<00:03:51.110> seasons<00:03:51.560> so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
cycle on it goes through two seasons so

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.610 
cycle on it goes through two seasons so
they<00:03:52.400> produce<00:03:52.670> less<00:03:53.300> than<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> others<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.410> it

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
they produce less than the others and it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:12.980 
they produce less than the others and it
takes<00:03:54.800> longer<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.310> produce<00:03:55.460> them<00:03:55.820> but
