project that I'll show you later on one
of<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> things<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> liked<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.710> let<00:00:25.920> me

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
of the things I liked about this let me

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.220 
of the things I liked about this let me
go<00:00:26.189> over<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.520> the<00:00:26.580> back<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
go over here to the back so I like the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.560 
go over here to the back so I like the
fact<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.619> where<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.040> Poli<00:00:29.610> drive<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
fact of where the Poli drive is for the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
fact of where the Poli drive is for the
rear<00:00:30.750> end<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.890> big<00:00:32.130> giant<00:00:32.400> pole<00:00:32.730> if

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
rear end you see this big giant pole if

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.550 
rear end you see this big giant pole if
i<00:00:33.000> zoom<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> belt<00:00:34.320> right

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
i zoom in for you can see the belt right

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.050 
i zoom in for you can see the belt right
here<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> pulley<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.910> either

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
here going on to the pulley on either

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.050 
here going on to the pulley on either
side<00:00:36.470> right<00:00:37.470> there<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
side right there and there I'm going to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.180 
side right there and there I'm going to
use<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.570> rear<00:00:39.840> end<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.440> its<00:00:40.620> belt<00:00:40.860> drive

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
use this rear end because its belt drive

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.490 
use this rear end because its belt drive
and<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.820> big<00:00:42.059> nice<00:00:42.300> poli<00:00:42.989> diameter

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and it's got that big nice poli diameter

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.750 
and it's got that big nice poli diameter
already<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> build

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
already on it so I'm going to build

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.939 
already on it so I'm going to build
something<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.270> holds<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.690> upright<00:00:46.320> wind

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
something that holds an upright wind

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.049 
something that holds an upright wind
generator<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.030> with

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
generator it's not going to be one with

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.700 
generator it's not going to be one with
a<00:00:48.210> bunch<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.480> blades<00:00:48.780> spinning<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
a bunch of blades spinning this

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
a bunch of blades spinning this
direction<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> typically<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
direction like we typically see this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
direction like we typically see this
will<00:00:52.019> be<00:00:52.140> blades<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> upright<00:00:53.670> shaft

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
will be blades all up a upright shaft

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.599 
will be blades all up a upright shaft
spinning<00:00:54.839> this<00:00:55.199> direction<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:56.339> will<00:00:56.489> give

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
spinning this direction which will give

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.430 
spinning this direction which will give
me<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> perfect<00:00:57.059> directional<00:00:57.690> spin<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> apply

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
me the perfect directional spin to apply

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
me the perfect directional spin to apply
the<00:00:58.469> belt<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.129> across<00:00:59.519> over<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.940> our<00:00:59.969> poli

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the belt right across over to our poli

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.209 
the belt right across over to our poli
right<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> should<00:01:01.620> give<00:01:01.739> us<00:01:01.890> drive

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
right there and I should give us drive

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.919 
right there and I should give us drive
to<00:01:02.489> drive<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> rear<00:01:03.120> end<00:01:03.359> we'll<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.870> how

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
to drive this rear end we'll look at how

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.740 
to drive this rear end we'll look at how
we<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.710> control<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> somehow<00:01:05.820> robotically

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
we can control this somehow robotically

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
we can control this somehow robotically
if<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> manual<00:01:08.430> robotic<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.180> low-tech

robotic way of controlling this out on
the<00:01:12.000> farm<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.170> there

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
the farm so I don't have to be out there
every<00:01:13.409> day<00:01:13.620> waiting<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.370> wind<00:01:14.550> it's<00:01:15.120> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
every day waiting for the wind it's just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
every day waiting for the wind it's just
any<00:01:15.420> time<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.810> wind<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.260> sun's<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.740> this

of that riding lawnmower I decided the
frame<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> extras<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.159> just

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
frame and all the extras on there just

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.889 
frame and all the extras on there just
far<00:01:35.640> too<00:01:35.670> heavy<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.390> project<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.840> start

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
far too heavy for this project to start

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.840 
far too heavy for this project to start
out<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> nice<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
out with to make it nice and easy to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
out with to make it nice and easy to
make<00:01:39.000> work<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.140> we've<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.770> rear

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
make work here so we've got is this rear

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
make work here so we've got is this rear
and<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.610> show<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.850> watch<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and I just want to show you watch this

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
and I just want to show you watch this
tire<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.289> here<00:01:43.469> rotate<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.520> takes<00:01:44.789> very

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
tire up here rotate this takes very

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
tire up here rotate this takes very
little<00:01:45.450> energy<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.469> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
little energy to get that thing to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
little energy to get that thing to
rotate<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> work

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
rotate and if I can get this to work

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
rotate and if I can get this to work
just<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.469> windmill<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.130> should

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just right with right windmill we should

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
just right with right windmill we should
be<00:01:50.399> able<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> move<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.939> pretty<00:01:51.240> efficiently

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
be able to move this pretty efficiently

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
be able to move this pretty efficiently
down<00:01:52.409> our<00:01:52.649> rows<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.969> said<00:01:54.149> we're<00:01:54.240> gonna

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
down our rows I like I said we're gonna

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
down our rows I like I said we're gonna
need<00:01:54.420> some<00:01:54.630> stability<00:01:54.780> things<00:01:55.590> probably

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
need some stability things probably

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.849 
need some stability things probably
wider<00:01:56.490> tire<00:01:56.789> stance<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.570> longer<00:01:58.500> track

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
wider tire stance than this longer track

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.080 
wider tire stance than this longer track
things<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> give<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> stability

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
things like that to give it stability

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
things like that to give it stability

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
once I screwed this on I bent it around

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.390 
once I screwed this on I bent it around
did<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.570> same<00:04:06.780> thing<00:04:06.989> over<00:04:07.109> here<00:04:07.400> with

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.560 
out in the field and see how well it
works<00:04:25.669> well<00:04:26.669> as<00:04:26.760> long<00:04:26.910> as<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.360> keeps

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
works well as long as it just keeps

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.560 
works well as long as it just keeps
working<00:04:27.780> like<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.320> folks<00:04:28.650> out<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.100> field

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
working like that folks out in the field

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.290 
working like that folks out in the field
that's<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.780> pretty<00:04:30.990> effective<00:04:31.169> little<00:04:31.770> machine

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
that's a pretty effective little machine

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.690 
that's a pretty effective little machine
just<00:04:33.300> slowly<00:04:33.510> cutting<00:04:33.960> its<00:04:34.169> way<00:04:34.289> across<00:04:34.700> under

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
just slowly cutting its way across under

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.210 
just slowly cutting its way across under
the<00:04:35.820> power<00:04:35.970> wind<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:37.409> a<00:04:37.470> small<00:04:37.740> amount<00:04:38.099> of

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
the power wind just a small amount of

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.420 
the power wind just a small amount of
robotics<00:04:38.760> added<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.150> their

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
robotics added to their

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.190 
robotics added to their
to<00:04:39.850> kind<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.120> guide<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.540> around<00:04:40.810> through<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
to kind of guide it around through the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200 
to kind of guide it around through the
fields<00:04:41.590> as<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.770> wind<00:04:41.980> turns<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:43.060> we've

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
fields as the wind turns it and we've

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.170 
fields as the wind turns it and we've
got<00:04:43.390> a<00:04:43.420> pretty<00:04:43.690> viable<00:04:43.990> system<00:04:44.380> here<00:04:45.180> just

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
got a pretty viable system here just

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.550 
got a pretty viable system here just
kind<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.360> walking<00:04:46.600> around<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.230> it's<00:04:47.410> moving

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
kind of walking around it as it's moving

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.910 
kind of walking around it as it's moving
here<00:04:48.120> giving<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.210> kind<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.480> an<00:04:49.600> idea<00:04:49.860> now<00:04:50.860> the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
here giving you kind of an idea now the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.770 
here giving you kind of an idea now the
winds<00:04:51.190> picking<00:04:51.400> up<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.670> bit<00:04:51.820> now<00:04:52.060> we'll

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
winds picking up a bit now we'll

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.440 
winds picking up a bit now we'll
actually<00:04:52.930> get<00:04:53.170> some<00:04:53.350> speed<00:04:53.620> out<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.860> this

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
actually get some speed out of this

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.580 
actually get some speed out of this
first<00:04:55.450> time<00:04:55.660> today<00:04:55.840> we've<00:04:56.110> actually<00:04:56.260> gotten

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
first time today we've actually gotten

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.840 
first time today we've actually gotten
some<00:04:56.800> speed<00:04:57.040> I'm<00:04:57.160> gonna<00:04:57.280> hold<00:04:57.370> still<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:57.760> you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
some speed I'm gonna hold still so you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.660 
some speed I'm gonna hold still so you
can<00:04:57.940> see<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.210> crawl<00:04:58.480> rate<00:04:59.460> now<00:05:00.460> that's

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
can see the crawl rate now that's

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.880 
can see the crawl rate now that's
awesome<00:05:01.180> folks<00:05:01.390> look<00:05:01.660> at<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.710> little

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
awesome folks look at that that little

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.890 
awesome folks look at that that little
blade<00:05:03.190> system<00:05:03.520> just<00:05:03.910> humming<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.480> circle

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
blade system just humming in a circle

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.710 
blade system just humming in a circle
this<00:05:05.830> was<00:05:06.010> our<00:05:06.130> last<00:05:06.190> test<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.940> evening<00:05:07.300> we

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
this was our last test of the evening we

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.120 
this was our last test of the evening we
wanted<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.050> give<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.500> test<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.950> all

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
wanted to give it a test in all

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.190 
wanted to give it a test in all
different<00:05:09.370> kinds<00:05:09.640> of<00:05:09.820> terrain<00:05:10.030> earlier<00:05:11.020> in

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
different kinds of terrain earlier in

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.780 
different kinds of terrain earlier in
the<00:05:11.320> video<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.590> saw<00:05:11.980> that<00:05:12.130> we<00:05:12.280> tested<00:05:12.670> this

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
the video you saw that we tested this

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.220 
the video you saw that we tested this
out<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.240> middle<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.570> rows<00:05:13.870> on<00:05:14.140> the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
out in the middle of the rows on the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.350 
out in the middle of the rows on the
field<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:14.800> actually<00:05:15.070> made<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> drive<00:05:15.790> over<00:05:15.820> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
field and actually made a drive over the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.790 
field and actually made a drive over the
crest<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.840> then<00:05:16.960> through<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.320> valley<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
crest and then through the valley of the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.250 
crest and then through the valley of the
row<00:05:18.070> going<00:05:18.790> sideways<00:05:19.090> over<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.660> Rose<00:05:19.930> was<00:05:20.230> a

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
row going sideways over the Rose was a

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.620 
row going sideways over the Rose was a
really<00:05:20.710> interesting<00:05:20.740> test<00:05:21.520> watch<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.450> see

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
really interesting test watch to see

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.210 
really interesting test watch to see
that<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:22.960> little<00:05:23.140> small<00:05:23.500> wind<00:05:23.770> generator

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
that that little small wind generator

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
good job moving right up the hill we're

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.920 
good job moving right up the hill we're
