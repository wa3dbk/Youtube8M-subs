00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 17 channel boxing and we 're going to do 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.269
 a boxing of a new TV and well then 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.550
 yes it was yes yes that has happened to me 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.160
 Pointin wrong because the camera costs him 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.730
 under a tripod so that it is there well 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.049
 focused and such 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920
 so well then let's go there 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.920
 let's do it 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.430
 good people, we have already removed 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.140
 all boxes all plastic all 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 the corks but cojones that always 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.200
 they are giving for ass all the boxing 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
 and here we have the interesting thing here 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.860
 we have the tele book support 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.860
 instructions the command and the cable for 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.210
 connect the fight what to do the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.190
 electricity so that it works so 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.170
 So, tell you the first thing that 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.460
 twitter when it's all ready when 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.229
 have everything already mounted on the desk 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.090
 with the winners and such I will put a photo 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.190
 by twitter with little has already built 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.720
 It's worth it if you want to see the I put it on u2 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.640
 interest the description to follow me and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 also tell you that recently a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.869
 meditation setup of how he recorded 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 so far with the big TV that I have 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 right now right behind me that does not 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.380
 I'm going to teach because that's what the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.000
 setup that I will also leave you in the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.229
 description a video in which he taught 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.270
 my room is worth as it was 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.790
 built so far then then 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 well I shot that undermine people in the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 description and he direct me neither when 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.619
 let's do another one, plugged pointed 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.060
 new play area with this TV and everything 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.040
 on the desk then when we get 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.899
 I saw myself at a figure of 20,000 30,000 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 40,000 50 thousand subscribers not when 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.070
 let's grow a little more and good 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230
 I will do a special and teach everyone 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.220
 my mushrooms as they were 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.140
 build or not that way I find 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.580
 much more comfortable to record since 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.080
 I have everything on my desk 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.340
 the other way then it would be good if 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.020
 be there lying on the bed recording in 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.400
 the bed and I found it very uncomfortable but 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.930
 well said of I will leave you the old one 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.550
 cover the description so well then let's go 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 with TV as you see here we are going to 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.730
 start by larrivey there and here we have 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 the mega instruction book that by 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.270
 true is pretty billet and I do not understand 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.940
 why the instruction book 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.860
 it takes to manage a pc or is it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.870
 turn on and off well here we have the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 TV stand which is quite 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.620
 high and it's quite good for me because I'm going 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.720
 to put the play and just below the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 tele and then to be the highest tele 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.020
 because the play does not prevent me from 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.790
 TV viewing obviously everything 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.310
 when we have me then cable 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 connect the TV to the electricity that 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.360
 certainly has this kind of input 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.520
 or exit as you want to take it which 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.230
 is similar to that of the playstation3 is 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.730
 totally the same with the two circuits 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.590
 this thing that has called me quite the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.780
 attention and good that we have after the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.130
 command of the TV as you see this is the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.720
 aspect of the bums I always say so 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.770
 before the TV had no command and there 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.240
 to get up to change channels 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.050
 but they already invented a command when 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.910
 you have to lift the sofa 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.920
 here you have the vato of the TV 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.000
 pretty simpleton like everyone here we have 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.860
 a ring 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.240
 this is a kind of plastic 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.830
 pouring what is the truth seems a 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.300
 ring the truth here we have also 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.640
 some screws that is like it will be for 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.900
 adjust the TV with the stand and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.490
 finally here we have the batteries 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.020
 obviously the command since if not the 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.700
 value does not work and finally that 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.530
 we have the TV that for our 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.140
 information is a samsung TV voucher is 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.210
 say that there is an affect on the offer 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.380
 that is enough or I will leave the offer 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.850
 in the description it's worth it because I do not know 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.350
 what is called the trade in which the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.310
 bought what is called apply or something 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.710
 Well I do not know the truth 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.540
 the one bought in the port of santa marÃ­a 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.220
 and that is that I do in the port of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.380
 SantamarÃ­a has bought then good 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.630
 well as you see a samsung a good 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.180
 well-known brand TV of 22 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.830
 inch true for you do not know 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.200
 also tell you that it is law and already be 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.250
 because they consume less energy than I do 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.810
 it comes quite well because as 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.760
 you know the light today with the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.350
 damn crisis is in the air and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.880
 Well, as you can see, he was not taken away 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.650
 the plastic now I will not mount as I have 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.970
 said I will put the photo by twitter and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.550
 nothing because the truth is a TV that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.010
 It cost 180 euros, it's worth for those who 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.700
 want to know 180 euro is pretty cheap 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.430
 and then it's full hd that you can see in 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.390
 1080p and nothing like that to put a photo by 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.950
 twitter of how everything will be 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.049
 you will have the old one is in the 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.459
 description thus is happy happy happy 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.140
 with this purchase with this acquisition 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.079
 for the channel because the truth is that 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.280
 Now I will be more comfortable at the time 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.739
 to record apart from that I'm also going to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.590
 to be able to do more 2.0 since as I had the 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.329
 old TV that was great and had it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.940
 very far away and I had to be in that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.289
 in bed I could not do 2.0 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.030
 therefore when they have the desk 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.449
 So keep going with this camera 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.650
 do more 2.0 before this I hope that 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.180
 be liked to leave a like if it has 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.740
 liked that there is a lot subscribe 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.120
 subscribe you are not yet 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.560

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.039
 that your friend is believed to see my 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.039
 new tele 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.500
 and then
