00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
what just happened now your start time

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.700 
what just happened now your start time
got<00:02:09.690> changed<00:02:10.050> because<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.379> trying<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
got changed because it was trying to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.200 
got changed because it was trying to
at<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.040> end<00:02:11.220> time<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:11.820> that's<00:02:11.970> why<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> always

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
at the end time so that's why you always

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.530 
at the end time so that's why you always
do<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> stop<00:02:13.470> time<00:02:13.800> first<00:02:14.340> before<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> start

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
do the stop time first before the start

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.670 
do the stop time first before the start
time<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.650> important<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.130> now

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
time that's not important for right now

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.810 
time that's not important for right now
so<00:02:19.680> let<00:02:19.800> me<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> other<00:02:20.370> clip<00:02:20.640> while<00:02:20.790> I
