have this edge with the green screen the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.539 
have this edge with the green screen the
problem<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.590> green<00:03:02.799> screen<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
problem with green screen is you get the

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.890 
problem with green screen is you get the
reflection<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> green<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:04.599> you're<00:03:04.810> always

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
reflection the green so you're always

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 
reflection the green so you're always
going<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.109> have<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.409> green<00:03:05.709> outline<00:03:05.980> unless

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
going to have this green outline unless

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.619 
going to have this green outline unless
you<00:03:06.519> have<00:03:06.609> a<00:03:06.639> huge<00:03:06.939> studio<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.329> can<00:03:07.510> stand

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
you have a huge studio I can stand

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.979 
you have a huge studio I can stand
really<00:03:07.900> far<00:03:07.989> back<00:03:08.379> from<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.879> but<00:03:09.989> ninety-nine

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
really far back from it but ninety-nine

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.479 
really far back from it but ninety-nine
percent<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.439> the<00:03:11.500> time<00:03:11.650> people<00:03:11.919> don't<00:03:12.250> stand

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
percent of the time people don't stand

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.520 
percent of the time people don't stand
far<00:03:12.700> enough<00:03:12.819> away<00:03:13.209> from<00:03:13.419> their<00:03:13.989> green<00:03:14.200> screen

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
far enough away from their green screen

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.089 
far enough away from their green screen
so<00:03:15.340> they<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.299> green<00:03:16.659> outline<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.620> don't<00:03:17.949> have

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
so they get green outline so don't have

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.920 
so they get green outline so don't have
a<00:03:18.129> green<00:03:18.370> outline<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.729> don't<00:03:19.060> see<00:03:19.389> any<00:03:19.629> green

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
a green outline I don't see any green

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.719
