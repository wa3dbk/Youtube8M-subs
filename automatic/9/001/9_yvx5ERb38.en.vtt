00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
in it which I have no idea what that is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.039 
in it which I have no idea what that is
but<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.159> hallux<00:01:53.610> ole<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.509> even<00:01:54.630> seeing

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
but the hallux ole if I'm even seeing

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.350 
but the hallux ole if I'm even seeing
that<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.320> reduces<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> puffiness<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that right reduces the puffiness and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.310 
that right reduces the puffiness and
shadows<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.729> dark<00:02:00.030> circles<00:02:00.930> under
