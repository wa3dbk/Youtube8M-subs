00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 the one so welcome to all web 88 in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.669
 this time we will learn to do the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.579
 timelapse effect in any version of 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.279
 sony vegas perfect for those who do not 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.320
 they know this effect of which is the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 union of several photographs 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 for example the video that you saw at 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 beginning of mario bros 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.730
 that video was made with 157 photographs 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.370
 you can have 10,000 thousand or the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 amount you want from photographs for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.290
 perform your timeline fortunately with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 sony vegas we can join all those 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.110
 photographs in less than 10 seconds ok 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.659
 For that, obviously, they should already have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 your photos and once you have your photos 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.759
 let's go then to the file option 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.799
 we go to where it says new and it's going to 

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.240
 leave then this template here 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 we just go to this icon that is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.420
 call match configuration 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 of medium there will open us for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 look for our photographs in this case 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.200
 I already have here in this folder that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.439
 llama mario here are the 157 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.659
 ok something very important all the 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.030
 photographs must be named in 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.950
 Accordingly mind what I mean 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.570
 with this if you realize here 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:40.549
 the first photo is called 4793 the second 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.310
 it's called 4794 and so on they should 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.100
 have an order for us to work 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.560
 effect after this we are simply going to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.759
 select with a click the first 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.970
 image and let's say open here we go 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.179
 to the accept button and we have done the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.490
 first part already to finalize we are going to 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.399
 go back to file and we go to the option that 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 it's called open here again we're going to 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.920
 select the first image and we will 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.980
 check the box that is called open 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.640
 sequence of still images we are going to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 select and we open it in this 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.760
 window, the only thing we are going to do is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 put a name 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.800
 and we are going to give it to accept and how they are given 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.319

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.220
