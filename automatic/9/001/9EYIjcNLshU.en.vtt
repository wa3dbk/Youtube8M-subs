00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
easing probes so it looks like he's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.679 
easing probes so it looks like he's
getting<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> range<00:01:24.030> upgrade<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> your

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
is just getting absolutely destroyed

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.920 
is just getting absolutely destroyed
seven<00:02:45.950> kills<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.300> templar<00:02:47.690> alone

be decorated want to rewrite the field
if<00:04:15.819> they<00:04:15.940> can<00:04:16.090> take<00:04:16.150> out<00:04:16.299> that's<00:04:16.450> for<00:04:16.660> colony

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
if they can take out that's for colony

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.270 
if they can take out that's for colony
those<00:04:17.049> dark<00:04:17.260> Kepler<00:04:17.530> might<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.829> able<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:18.040> cycle

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
those dark Kepler might be able to cycle

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.039 
those dark Kepler might be able to cycle
their<00:04:18.489> way<00:04:18.639> around<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.750> very<00:04:19.870> least

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
their way around but it's very least

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.750 
their way around but it's very least
even<00:04:20.320> if<00:04:20.380> this<00:04:20.560> attack<00:04:20.680> fails<00:04:21.220> completely

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760

even if this attack fails completely
that<00:04:22.150> three<00:04:22.360> thought<00:04:22.540> position<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.350> to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
that three thought position is going to

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.040 
that three thought position is going to
be<00:04:23.530> established<00:04:24.370> but<00:04:24.520> Elliott<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.540> really<00:04:25.930> bad

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
be established but Elliott in really bad

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.490 
be established but Elliott in really bad
shape<00:04:26.250> actually<00:04:27.250> going<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.580> call<00:04:27.700> latency<00:04:28.500> for

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
shape actually going to call latency for

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.840 
shape actually going to call latency for
yeah<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.860> actually<00:04:30.010> makes<00:04:30.340> sense<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.639> saying

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
yeah that actually makes sense is saying

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.659 
yeah that actually makes sense is saying
how<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.030> had<00:04:31.240> some<00:04:31.510> trouble<00:04:32.260> dodging<00:04:32.830> actually

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
how we had some trouble dodging actually

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.070 
how we had some trouble dodging actually
going<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.850> end<00:04:33.970> up<00:04:34.000> losing<00:04:34.389> all<00:04:34.600> of<00:04:34.630> his<00:04:34.750> main

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
going to end up losing all of his main

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.110 
going to end up losing all of his main
right<00:04:35.260> here<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:36.010> that's<00:04:36.280> going<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> be<00:04:36.490> GG<00:04:36.789> it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
right here so that's going to be GG it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.000 
right here so that's going to be GG it
looks<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.479> he's<00:04:37.600> going<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.780> call<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.350> just

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
looks like he's going to call it in just

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.230 
looks like he's going to call it in just
a<00:04:39.160> second<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:40.330> ya<00:04:40.570> Ali<00:04:40.870> does<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.200> lot<00:04:41.410> of
