round<00:00:09.870> pick<00:00:10.139> well<00:00:11.040> despite<00:00:11.519> what<00:00:11.730> my<00:00:12.170> partner

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
round pick well despite what my partner

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099

is<00:00:13.410> petitioning<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.340> every<00:00:14.910> day<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:15.960> on

is petitioning for every day to go on

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.170 
is petitioning for every day to go on
the<00:00:16.199> offensive<00:00:16.800> side<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> ball<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the offensive side of the ball with that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.750 
the offensive side of the ball with that
19th<00:00:18.630> pick<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.619> thinking<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.250> Thomas

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
19th pick I'm thinking that Thomas

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
19th pick I'm thinking that Thomas
Dimitroff<00:00:21.000> has<00:00:21.390> something<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:21.869> his<00:00:21.990> sleeve<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
Dimitroff has something up his sleeve I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.519 
Dimitroff has something up his sleeve I
believe<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> due<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> activity<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
believe that due to the activity the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.050 
believe that due to the activity the
people<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.980> they've<00:00:26.130> looked<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
people that they've looked at and the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.950 
people that they've looked at and the
way<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> they've<00:00:27.510> been<00:00:27.630> living<00:00:27.750> I'm

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
way that they've been living I'm

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
way that they've been living I'm
thinking<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.680> might<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:29.039> targeting

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
thinking that he might be targeting

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
thinking that he might be targeting
someone<00:00:30.269> higher<00:00:30.570> than<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> 19th<00:00:31.410> pick<00:00:31.650> which

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
someone higher than the 19th pick which

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.150 
someone higher than the 19th pick which
could<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.550> move<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> draft<00:00:33.750> or

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
could be a move up in the draft or

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.350 
could be a move up in the draft or
considerably<00:00:35.160> may<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> move<00:00:35.850> backwards

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
considerably may be a move backwards

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
considerably may be a move backwards
because<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.290> such<00:00:37.500> tremendous<00:00:37.739> value

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
because there's such tremendous value

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
because there's such tremendous value
and<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> Tony<00:00:39.420> Gonzalez<00:00:39.930> trade<00:00:40.170> last

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and with the Tony Gonzalez trade last

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
and with the Tony Gonzalez trade last
year<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.920> having<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> second<00:00:41.730> round

year and not having that second round

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.760 
year and not having that second round
pick<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.450> wouldn't<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:42.989> shocked<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.590> them

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pick I wouldn't be shocked to see them

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
pick I wouldn't be shocked to see them
move<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.940> move<00:00:45.120> down<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.809> any<00:00:46.170> point<00:00:46.410> in

maybe better than any we've seen in a
long<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.330> now<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.680> as

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
were a troublesome in 2009 but if this

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.850 
were a troublesome in 2009 but if this
team<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> compete<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.500> Saints

moving<00:01:29.159> forward<00:01:29.460> what's<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> key<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
moving forward what's the key if you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
moving forward what's the key if you
can't<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> opposing<00:01:31.320> quarterback<00:01:31.770> on

can't get the opposing quarterback on
their<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.579> think<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> have

made the NFC Championship game a few

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
made the NFC Championship game a few

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
years back before this administration

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
years back before this administration
came<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.320> did<00:01:43.500> such<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> great<00:01:43.950> job<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
came in they did such a great job of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
came in they did such a great job of
sacking<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> quarterback<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.140> got

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sacking the quarterback I think they got

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.810 
sacking the quarterback I think they got
to<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.500> much<00:01:46.799> better<00:01:47.040> quarterback<00:01:47.520> pressure

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to get much better quarterback pressure

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.950 
to get much better quarterback pressure
they're<00:01:48.030> gonna<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> better<00:01:48.659> push

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
they're gonna have to get a better push

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.719 
they're gonna have to get a better push
their<00:01:49.229> whether<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.159> outside<00:01:50.460> linebacker

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
their whether it's an outside linebacker

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
their whether it's an outside linebacker
whether<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> new<00:01:51.659> defensive<00:01:52.200> end<00:01:52.409> they're

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
whether it's a new defensive end they're

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.590 
whether it's a new defensive end they're
going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> find<00:01:53.939> ways<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.390> create

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
going to have to find ways to create

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.929 
going to have to find ways to create
that<00:01:54.720> plus<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.710> two<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.700> got<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
that plus I think two is is you got to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
that plus I think two is is you got to
take<00:01:57.060> pressure<00:01:57.299> off<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.689> secondary<00:01:58.229> because

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
take pressure off that secondary because

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.100 
take pressure off that secondary because
that<00:01:59.100> secondaries<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.850> as<00:01:59.969> bad<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.899> looked

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that secondaries not as bad as it looked

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
that secondaries not as bad as it looked
at<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.560> points<00:02:01.979> last<00:02:02.159> year<00:02:02.549> there's<00:02:03.060> talent

at some points last year there's talent
there<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.049> trust<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.159> Thomas<00:02:05.549> said<00:02:05.790> you

going<00:03:57.350> forward<00:03:57.680> like<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:57.860> year<00:03:58.250> they're

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
already seen that under Thomas and coach

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.120 
already seen that under Thomas and coach
that<00:04:22.510> they've<00:04:22.690> gone<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.290> route<00:04:23.500> before<00:04:23.740> you

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
that they've gone that route before you

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.530 
that they've gone that route before you
know<00:04:24.220> find<00:04:24.520> somebody<00:04:24.910> else<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.270> someone

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
know find somebody else that someone

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.570 
know find somebody else that someone
else<00:04:25.630> doesn't<00:04:25.930> have<00:04:26.170> used<00:04:26.350> for<00:04:26.590> bring<00:04:27.310> him<00:04:27.430> in

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.920 
else doesn't have used for bring him in
and<00:04:27.790> make<00:04:28.000> him<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.180> productive<00:04:28.570> member<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.840> the

and make him a productive member of the
Falcons<00:04:29.130> Falcons<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.250> think<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.600> benefit

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
Falcons Falcons I think it's a benefit

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.780 
Falcons Falcons I think it's a benefit
because<00:04:32.230> of<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.860> fact<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.220> they're<00:04:33.670> going

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
because of the fact that they're going

a lot of the decisions they've made and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.160 
a lot of the decisions they've made and
they're<00:05:03.520> going<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.670> be<00:05:03.820> blips<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.570> on<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
they're going to be blips and on the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.230 
they're going to be blips and on the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
radar and moves that are made that

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.450 
radar and moves that are made that
aren't<00:05:07.450> as<00:05:07.510> successful<00:05:07.630> but<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.620> truly<00:05:09.070> believe

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
aren't as successful but I truly believe

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.210 
aren't as successful but I truly believe
that<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.790> mission<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.600> plan<00:05:10.930> here<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.830> so

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
that the mission and the plan here is so

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.770 
that the mission and the plan here is so
uniform<00:05:12.790> from<00:05:12.910> top<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.180> bottom<00:05:13.360> in<00:05:13.690> this
