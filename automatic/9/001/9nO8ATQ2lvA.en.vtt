00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
stone I knows it's really soft metal

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.550 
stone I knows it's really soft metal
it's<00:02:17.970> stainless<00:02:18.300> steel<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.380> really

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it's stainless steel but it's really

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
it's stainless steel but it's really
soft<00:02:19.920> stainless<00:02:20.400> steel<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:23.280> thing<00:02:23.490> is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
soft stainless steel and one thing is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.250 
soft stainless steel and one thing is
really<00:02:23.730> good<00:02:23.970> about<00:02:24.090> soft<00:02:24.540> stainless<00:02:25.020> steel

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
really good about soft stainless steel

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the bad thing about soft stainless steel

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430 
the bad thing about soft stainless steel
is<00:02:28.640> up<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:30.030> dull<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:31.020> they're<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.230> so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
is up it's dull you know they're just so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.080 
is up it's dull you know they're just so
soft<00:02:31.830> they<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.250> don't<00:02:32.430> keep<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> real<00:02:32.910> good

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
soft they just don't keep a real good

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.970 
soft they just don't keep a real good
edge<00:02:33.270> okay<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.500> get<00:02:34.650> one<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.800> these

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
edge okay but you can get one of these

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.260 
edge okay but you can get one of these
little<00:02:35.040> things<00:02:35.459> here<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> really<00:02:36.120> like

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
little things here and I really like

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.360 
little things here and I really like
these<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.020> can<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.430> real<00:02:38.430> fast<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:41.250> can

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
these you can just real fast and you can

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.830 
these you can just real fast and you can
use<00:02:41.520> your<00:02:41.640> core<00:02:41.850> aside<00:02:42.120> your<00:02:42.330> fine<00:02:42.510> side<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
use your core aside your fine side and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.260 
use your core aside your fine side and
it<00:02:42.900> sharpens<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.410> fairly<00:02:43.980> quickly<00:02:44.340> because

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
it sharpens up fairly quickly because

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.910 
it sharpens up fairly quickly because
like<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.600> said<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.170> soft<00:02:46.410> stainless

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

have a bunch of them that hard steel

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410 
have a bunch of them that hard steel
takes<00:02:52.110> forever<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.920> put<00:02:53.160> an<00:02:53.280> edge<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
takes forever to put an edge on but it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.199 
takes forever to put an edge on but it
keeps<00:02:54.780> really<00:02:55.200> good<00:02:55.410> too<00:02:55.820> I'm<00:02:56.820> gonna<00:02:56.940> grab<00:02:57.180> a
