 cattle prod 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.080

 in this case we put the left picana and 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.629
 picanya right 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.570
 is that we are going to put our hand and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.199

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 let's cut our candles to go to 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.720
 please fiber and more or less we are going to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.930

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.930
 cut 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.250
 every two fingers we are cutting 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.670

 to go in the let's fit our 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.860
 chop in the wires in this way 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.020
 if it is already a donate they finished and 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 This is how our picaña is before 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 put it on the wires 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.310
 and insert our pike 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.520

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.750
