00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.580
 Directly now 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.709
 Adjust the adjustment here at 3 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.599
 Stage bolt of the first stage 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.290
 This second stage screw is placed 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.240
 The third step is the depth of this shot 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.750
 Set the width to capture immediately 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.990
 This way is prescribed here 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 Clear all nut extensions or 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.739
 Push lock nut 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.530
 Clear All 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.059
 If we twist the screw here or 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.260
 Here we share 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.179
 If we are distorted 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.800
 Socks or rise or if 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.729
 The opposite side will 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.860
 Fall 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.979
 But the adjustable angle of the attack is actually, we need 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.860
 Adjust this thing, we also 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 Analyze why we reverse and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.780
 The board changes its corner 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.740
 Now the opposite side will reverse 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.330
 This will be flattened 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.100
 This is the most important thing we adjust 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.160
 Plow clear 捻 screw and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.050
 share it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.420
 His movement is so adjustable and 4 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.960
 This adjustment 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.500
 Tooth shape 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.350
 Department, thus adjustable width 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.440
 What to capture here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.560
 Attention when we 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.200
 mobile 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.350
 The field plate is always positioned at the axis 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.290
 Tractor driving and it deviates 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 The cost of one side makes the frame 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.370
 Two square rings 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 He always keeps this board in parallel 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.130
 Tractor driving and parallel to the axis 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.110
 Tractor, it is very important that it still needs 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.200
 Remember, this adjustment 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 behavior 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.220
 Now plowing adjustment 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.659
 But it must be remembered that it is important 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.150
 This is very important when you will spend 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.629
 Any adjustment ditch or not 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.769
 Always ditch please remember, 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.670
 There is also a legion there. 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.209
 Rebound 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.329
 And before twisting 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.400
 The bolt we if these elevators 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.579
 Always clean because that 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.480
 Land will arrive and away 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.609
 respectively 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.250
 We need them, delete too, then 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.470
 Just this screw strike 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.370
 Depth required 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.989
 With this lever, you too 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.780
 Swipe width but you have to capture 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.030
 Choose not to play 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.710
 More than playing with bolts and playing it 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.160
 frame
