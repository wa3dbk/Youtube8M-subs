ran<00:00:00.240> out<00:00:00.329> of<00:00:00.359> memory<00:00:01.159> anyways<00:00:02.159> as<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.550> was

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
ran out of memory anyways as I was

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.230 
ran out of memory anyways as I was
saying<00:00:03.170> it's<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.259> really<00:00:04.529> rich<00:00:04.710> rich<00:00:05.700> setting

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
saying it's a really rich rich setting

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.290 
saying it's a really rich rich setting
so<00:00:06.870> everything<00:00:07.560> gets<00:00:07.770> warm<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:08.970> used<00:00:09.179> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
so everything gets warm and it's used to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.259 
so everything gets warm and it's used to
moving<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.950> the<00:00:10.950> full<00:00:11.219> entire<00:00:11.639> break-in

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
moving and the full entire break-in

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.359 
moving and the full entire break-in
period<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.200> five<00:00:13.620> old<00:00:14.070> tanks<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.580> fuel

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
period is about five old tanks of fuel

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.820 
period is about five old tanks of fuel
now<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.789> people<00:00:17.910> say<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.779> first<00:00:18.960> tank

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
now some people say for the first tank

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.470 
now some people say for the first tank
or<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.550> let<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> sit<00:00:21.000> there<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> idle

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
or two just let it sit there and idle

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570 
or two just let it sit there and idle
that<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> want<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.859> don't

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that is not what you want to do don't

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
that is not what you want to do don't
believe<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.470> let<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.800> sit

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
believe in that because you let it sit

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.419 
believe in that because you let it sit
here<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.340> idle<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.119> engine<00:00:27.599> has<00:00:27.840> no<00:00:27.869> air<00:00:28.830> like

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
here in idle this engine has no air like

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
here in idle this engine has no air like
if<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.300> moving<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> breeze<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
if when it's moving as a breeze and it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
if when it's moving as a breeze and it
cools<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> down<00:00:32.340> now<00:00:33.210> unless<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> windy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
cools it down now unless it's a windy

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
cools it down now unless it's a windy
day<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.140> guess<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.760> really<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
day I guess you can but really like the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
day I guess you can but really like the
first<00:00:36.870> tank<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> fuel<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.850> course

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
first tank of fuel you just of course

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.380 
first tank of fuel you just of course
start<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.980> just<00:00:40.980> let<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.210> slow

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
start it and just let it go not as slow

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
start it and just let it go not as slow
as<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.660> maybe<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.440> bit<00:00:43.559> faster

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
as this maybe just a little bit faster

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.369 
as this maybe just a little bit faster
and<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> take<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.870> circles

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and just kind of take it in like circles

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.420 
and just kind of take it in like circles
or<00:00:46.500> figure<00:00:46.710> eights<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:46.920> whatever<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> doesn't

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
or figure eights or whatever it doesn't

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000 
or figure eights or whatever it doesn't
really<00:00:47.730> matter<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.360> let<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> break<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really matter and let it break in and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
really matter and let it break in and
then<00:00:50.129> after<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> tank<00:00:51.000> second<00:00:51.809> tank<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
then after that tank second tank you can

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.240 
then after that tank second tank you can
just<00:00:52.379> give<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.770> bit<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
just give it a little bit more and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
just give it a little bit more and
gradually<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.239> by<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.539> you're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
gradually go in and by the time you're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.470 
gradually go in and by the time you're
in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> fifth<00:00:55.050> tank<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.280> able

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
in the fifth tank you should be able

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
in the fifth tank you should be able
actually<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> third<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.109> fourth<00:00:58.609> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
actually in like the third or fourth you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
actually in like the third or fourth you
can<00:00:59.760> lean<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> get

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can lean it out a little bit so you get

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.420 
can lean it out a little bit so you get
a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.590> more<00:01:01.800> speed<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.789> doggy<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
a little bit more speed not so doggy and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.050 
a little bit more speed not so doggy and
so<00:01:05.430> yeah<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:07.700> doesn't<00:01:08.700> mean

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so yeah you can do that doesn't mean

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
so yeah you can do that doesn't mean
it's<00:01:09.240> fully<00:01:09.420> brave<00:01:09.720> broken<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.920> don't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's fully brave broken in so don't

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's fully brave broken in so don't
completely<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.110> sounds

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
completely like just because it sounds

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
completely like just because it sounds
good<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.590> everything<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.220> keep<00:01:14.520> run<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
good and everything don't keep run it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200 
good and everything don't keep run it
like<00:01:15.180> extremely<00:01:15.900> full<00:01:16.560> throttle<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> know

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
like extremely full throttle you know

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.539 
like extremely full throttle you know
because<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.990> damage<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.740> internals<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
because it will damage the internals so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
because it will damage the internals so
don't<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> easy<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
don't do that just take it easy for the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.550 
don't do that just take it easy for the
first<00:01:22.979> few<00:01:23.159> tanks<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.689> gradually<00:01:25.290> kind

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
first few tanks and then gradually kind

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
first few tanks and then gradually kind
of<00:01:25.680> clean<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
of clean it out and then take it a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.460 
of clean it out and then take it a
little<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.810> fashioned<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
little bit fashioned by the time you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.069 
little bit fashioned by the time you
don't<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> go

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
don't think you're good to go

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.950 
don't think you're good to go
so<00:01:31.079> um<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.640> exceed<00:01:35.750> especially<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so um I know the exceed especially this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.700 
so um I know the exceed especially this
hyper<00:01:37.409> speed<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.460> beginner<00:01:38.939> version<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
hyper speed is a beginner version and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
hyper speed is a beginner version and
it's<00:01:40.710> cheaper<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.850> 130<00:01:42.479> 130<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it's cheaper it's like 130 130 so you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
it's cheaper it's like 130 130 so you
know<00:01:45.869> definitely<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.920> bad<00:01:47.130> price<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
know definitely not bad price and the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
know definitely not bad price and the
reason<00:01:48.750> why<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.500> most<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
reason why it is is because most of the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.710 
reason why it is is because most of the
stuff<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> plastic<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.659> said

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
stuff here is plastic and like I said

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.130 
stuff here is plastic and like I said
you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> upgrade<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.890> metal<00:01:53.149> but<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you can upgrade it and get metal but it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
you can upgrade it and get metal but it
is<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> good<00:01:55.649> beginners<00:01:56.159> car<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.700> easy<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
is a good beginners car it's easy to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.010 
is a good beginners car it's easy to
control<00:01:57.990> I've<00:01:58.670> had<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.240> other<00:02:00.420> version<00:02:00.869> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
control I've had the other version just

control I've had the other version just
it's<00:02:01.229> point<00:02:01.469> eight<00:02:01.649> teen<00:02:02.159> engine<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.110> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's point eight teen engine and I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.370 
it's point eight teen engine and I
wanted<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> try<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> smaller<00:02:04.979> size<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.570> had

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
wanted to try the smaller size and I had

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.050 
wanted to try the smaller size and I had
the<00:02:07.500> 18<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> sold<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.899> got<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> one

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the 18 and I sold it so got this one

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.960 
the 18 and I sold it so got this one
I<00:02:11.150> wanted<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> try<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:11.989> out<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.450> yeah<00:02:15.970> anyways

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
I wanted to try it out so yeah anyways

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.760 
I wanted to try it out so yeah anyways
oh<00:02:17.660> there's<00:02:18.290> something<00:02:18.470> else<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.739> should

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
oh there's something else I should

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.050 
oh there's something else I should
mention<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> don't<00:02:19.430> think<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.730> gonna<00:02:19.849> put

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
mention and I don't think I'm gonna put

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610 
mention and I don't think I'm gonna put
it<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.239> because<00:02:20.420> I'm<00:02:20.780> not<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> kind<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.260> person

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
it in because I'm not the kind of person

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620 
it in because I'm not the kind of person
that<00:02:21.650> would<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.920> dumb<00:02:22.130> enough<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.459> do<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.849> but

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
that would be dumb enough to do this but

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.130 
that would be dumb enough to do this but
if<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.290> open<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.930> course

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
if you open up this in here of course

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.420 
if you open up this in here of course
it'll<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.560> battery<00:02:27.890> pack<00:02:28.099> or<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.250> put

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it'll be that battery pack or you put

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
it'll be that battery pack or you put
all<00:02:28.519> those<00:02:28.640> double<00:02:28.970> A's<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.269> which<00:02:29.540> there's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
all those double A's in which there's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.360 
all those double A's in which there's
four<00:02:31.360> connected<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.290> wire<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.250> can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
four connected to that is a wire you can

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.400 
four connected to that is a wire you can
actually<00:02:34.580> slot<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.780> gets<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.989> slot<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
actually slot that gets a slot and you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.150 
actually slot that gets a slot and you
can<00:02:36.530> pull<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.830> off

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
can pull it off

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.699 
can pull it off
and<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.849> can<00:02:37.970> get<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.269> chip<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.440> put<00:02:39.590> it

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and you can get this chip and you put it

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.430 
and you can get this chip and you put it
in<00:02:39.830> there<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:40.880> chips<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.380> too

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in there and that chips so if you go too

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.690 
in there and that chips so if you go too
far<00:02:42.769> out<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:43.010> your<00:02:43.130> car<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.519> lose

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
far out with your car and you lose

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.729 
far out with your car and you lose
signal<00:02:43.880> well<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.750> car's<00:02:44.989> gonna<00:02:45.200> like<00:02:45.470> haul

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
signal well your car's gonna like haul

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.610 
signal well your car's gonna like haul
balls<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:46.549> go<00:02:46.670> wherever<00:02:46.850> at<00:02:47.060> once<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
balls and just go wherever at once so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.650 
balls and just go wherever at once so
with<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.400> thing<00:02:49.610> those<00:02:49.880> as<00:02:50.060> soon<00:02:50.390> as<00:02:50.540> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
with this thing those as soon as it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.710 
with this thing those as soon as it
loses<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.900> signal<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.799> engages<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.340> brakes<00:02:52.730> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
loses a signal it engages the brakes so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.839 
loses a signal it engages the brakes so
you<00:02:53.930> don't<00:02:54.049> have<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.260> chase<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.640> will

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
you don't have to chase it and that will

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.479 
you don't have to chase it and that will
happen<00:02:56.150> if<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.660> too<00:02:56.810> far<00:02:57.019> out<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.950> I

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
happen if you go too far out so and I

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.190 
happen if you go too far out so and I
mean<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:58.940> go<00:02:59.060> quite<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> distance<00:02:59.840> but

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
mean you have to go quite a distance but

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
mean you have to go quite a distance but
you<00:03:00.709> know<00:03:00.830> that's<00:03:01.400> why<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.610> don't<00:03:01.849> really<00:03:02.090> need

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
you know that's why I don't really need

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.320 
you know that's why I don't really need
it<00:03:03.049> but<00:03:03.349> you're<00:03:04.280> racing<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.790> I'd<00:03:04.910> probably<00:03:05.090> get

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
it but you're racing it I'd probably get

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.990 
it but you're racing it I'd probably get
one<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:06.290> isn't<00:03:06.470> really<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.830> racing<00:03:07.190> vehicle<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
one this isn't really a racing vehicle I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.270 
one this isn't really a racing vehicle I
guess<00:03:08.269> they're<00:03:08.840> RC<00:03:09.290> car<00:03:09.799> but<00:03:12.069> anyways

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
guess they're RC car but anyways

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.949 
guess they're RC car but anyways
most<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.790> its<00:03:13.910> plastic<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.599> not<00:03:14.690> really

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
most of its plastic so it's not really

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.289 
most of its plastic so it's not really
made<00:03:15.140> for<00:03:15.170> jumping<00:03:15.760> although<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.150> are

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
made for jumping although if you are

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.880 
made for jumping although if you are
going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.690> jump<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.079> I<00:03:18.320> would<00:03:18.620> put<00:03:18.970> those<00:03:19.970> uh

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
going to jump it I would put those uh

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.039 
going to jump it I would put those uh
these<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> top<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.940> your<00:03:24.400> suspension<00:03:26.049> they

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
these on the top of your suspension they

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.229 
these on the top of your suspension they
are<00:03:27.200> oil<00:03:27.500> filled<00:03:27.739> by<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> way<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.640> most<00:03:28.850> RC

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
are oil filled by the way like most RC

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.349 
are oil filled by the way like most RC
cars<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:32.920> anyways<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.280> guess<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.090> could<00:03:35.209> show<00:03:35.329> you

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
cars so anyways I guess I could show you

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.259 
cars so anyways I guess I could show you
the<00:03:35.450> bottom<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.079> really<00:03:36.260> matters<00:03:37.269> it's

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the bottom if it really matters it's

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.470 
the bottom if it really matters it's
blue<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:39.410> aluminum<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.819> one<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.239> few

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
blue it's aluminum it's one of the few

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.270 
blue it's aluminum it's one of the few
things<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:42.049> here<00:03:42.260> that's<00:03:42.470> actually<00:03:42.620> metal

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
things on here that's actually metal

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.990 
things on here that's actually metal
besides<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.600> engine<00:03:47.109> probably<00:03:49.000> throttle

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
besides the engine probably throttle

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.660 
besides the engine probably throttle
cable<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:50.420> everything<00:03:50.600> down<00:03:51.019> here<00:03:51.319> and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670
