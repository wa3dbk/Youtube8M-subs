00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.250 

so<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.090> while<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:09.480> drying<00:02:09.660> take<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
so now while that's drying take the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.380 
so now while that's drying take the
white<00:02:10.530> nail<00:02:10.890> polish<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> cut<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.090> entire

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.149 

so<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.959> next<00:02:20.080> step<00:02:20.349> we're<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.860> draw

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
so for the next step we're going to draw

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.839 
so for the next step we're going to draw
the<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:22.620> piggy<00:02:23.620> sign<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.220> middle<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:24.819> I

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
the little piggy sign in the middle so I

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.809 
the little piggy sign in the middle so I
take<00:02:25.060> another<00:02:25.269> drop<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.959> red<00:02:26.110> nail<00:02:26.319> polish

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and also take a drop of the blue nail

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.850 
and also take a drop of the blue nail
polish<00:02:30.840> basically<00:02:31.840> starting<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.560> red

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.390 
polish basically starting with the red
we're<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.060> draw<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> tiny<00:02:35.190> bottom<00:02:36.190> half

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
we're going to draw a tiny bottom half

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.229 
we're going to draw a tiny bottom half
of<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> circle<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.629> then<00:02:37.840> take<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.200> blue<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
of the circle and then take the blue and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:47.280 
of the circle and then take the blue and
draw<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.750> other<00:02:40.900> half<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.319> circle<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:47.140> can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
draw the other half a circle and you can

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.559 
draw the other half a circle and you can
leave<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:47.950> think<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.819> might<00:02:49.030> be<00:02:49.060> cool<00:02:49.510> to

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
leave it but I think it might be cool to

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.589 
leave it but I think it might be cool to
try<00:02:50.049> lining<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.980> french<00:02:51.280> tips<00:02:51.579> with<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:52.090> topi

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
try lining the french tips with a topi

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.479 
try lining the french tips with a topi
metallic<00:02:53.019> silver<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.709> we'll<00:02:53.890> give<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.250> go

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
metallic silver so we'll give that a go

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.369 
metallic silver so we'll give that a go
otherwise<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.599> keep<00:02:55.840> going<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.319> just

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
otherwise you can keep going and just

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.860 
otherwise you can keep going and just
simply<00:02:56.950> create<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.519> with<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.000> topcoat<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
simply create this with a topcoat the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.270 
simply create this with a topcoat the
same<00:02:59.049> as<00:02:59.170> usual<00:02:59.349> I'm<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.769> going<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> dip<00:03:00.129> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
same as usual I'm just going to dip it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.250 
same as usual I'm just going to dip it
in<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.000> brush<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.620> simply<00:03:02.620> line<00:03:02.799> it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160 

and<00:03:11.250> that's<00:03:12.209> what<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.450> looks<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:13.019> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and that's what it looks like with the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.750 
and that's what it looks like with the
silver<00:03:13.530> lining<00:03:13.860> I'm<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.370> liking<00:03:14.580> this

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
silver lining I'm really liking this

look so I finally just finished with a
top<00:03:16.830> coat<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.310> it'll<00:03:17.519> last<00:03:17.670> for<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.120> long<00:03:18.330> as

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
top coat so it'll last for as long as

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.820 
top coat so it'll last for as long as
