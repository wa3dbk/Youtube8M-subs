and I took these stalks and I cut them
at<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.450> various<00:00:37.260> lengths<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.760> cut

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
at very various lengths and I just cut

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
at very various lengths and I just cut
the<00:00:39.570> end<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.680> cut<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> brown<00:00:41.430> stuff

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the end you know cut all the brown stuff

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
the end you know cut all the brown stuff
barely<00:00:42.450> off<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> ends<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.530> these<00:00:43.710> stalks

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
barely off the ends of all these stalks

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
barely off the ends of all these stalks
and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.870> them<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.590> water<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.460> can

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and I put them in the water and you can

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
and I put them in the water and you can
see<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> longest<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
see that the one that's the longest is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
see that the one that's the longest is
the<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.039> taken<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> quickest

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the one that's taken off the quickest

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
the one that's taken off the quickest
but<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:53.309> new<00:00:54.050> green<00:00:55.129> growth<00:00:56.129> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
but all of them have new green growth on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.470 
but all of them have new green growth on
them<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.520> they're<00:00:59.520> actually<00:00:59.820> getting

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
them and they're actually getting

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.770 
them and they're actually getting
started<00:01:01.230> again<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.180> let's<00:01:03.180> take<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.600> one

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
started again and let's take this one

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
started again and let's take this one
out<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
all the green stuff now we're waiting

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
all the green stuff now we're waiting
again<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.740> roots<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:15.299> coming<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
again for roots to start coming out of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.340 
again for roots to start coming out of
there

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
there

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
there
and<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.880> yet<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.570> when

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and and they're not there yet but when

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.270 
and and they're not there yet but when
the<00:01:18.810> roots<00:01:19.020> start<00:01:19.320> coming<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.130> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the roots start coming out then it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
the roots start coming out then it's
gonna<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.729> time<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> transplant<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> I'm

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
gonna be time to transplant and I'm

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
gonna be time to transplant and I'm
thinking<00:01:23.400> man<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.299> easy<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.080> start

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
thinking man if it's this easy to start

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.940 
thinking man if it's this easy to start
these<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:26.210> what<00:01:27.210> would<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.720> stopping<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.439> from

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
these up what would be stopping me from

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
these up what would be stopping me from
growing<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:29.909> inside<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.930> house

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
growing this stuff inside my house

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
growing this stuff inside my house
year-round<00:01:32.150> because<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.900> simple

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
year-round because this is pretty simple

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.859 
year-round because this is pretty simple
I<00:01:34.680> mean<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.100> find<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:36.540> place<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I mean you just find a good place with

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
I mean you just find a good place with
plenty<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> sunlight<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.640> window<00:01:39.030> gets

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
plenty of sunlight and this window gets

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
plenty of sunlight and this window gets
sunlight<00:01:39.720> pretty<00:01:40.049> much<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.920> day<00:01:41.520> long<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:43.009> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sunlight pretty much all day long and of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
sunlight pretty much all day long and of
course<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> side<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.030> getting<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> most

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
course the side that's getting the most

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
course the side that's getting the most
sunlight<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.680> course<00:01:46.890> experiencing<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
sunlight is of course experiencing the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.630 
sunlight is of course experiencing the
most<00:01:48.119> growth<00:01:48.590> maybe<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:50.040> set<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.280> some

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
most growth maybe I could set up some

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.249 
most growth maybe I could set up some
kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> system<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.479> front<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.899> window

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
kind of system in front of this window

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
kind of system in front of this window
to<00:01:52.320> grow<00:01:52.740> more<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.759> anyway<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.270> wanted<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
