00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
because I really don't remember where

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.039 
because I really don't remember where
the<00:00:11.219> circlings<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.660> there<00:00:13.019> are

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the circlings on I think that there are

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.450 
the circlings on I think that there are
brother<00:00:13.349> basic<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.860> how<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.219> either

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
brother basic and how do I get either

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
brother basic and how do I get either
and<00:00:15.120> who<00:00:15.210> cares<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.650> move<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.220> and

don't<00:00:33.270> even<00:00:33.420> remember<00:00:33.630> doing<00:00:34.110> visible<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
don't even remember doing visible like I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.750 
don't even remember doing visible like I
do<00:00:35.309> remember<00:00:35.820> doing<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.450> elderson<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
do remember doing this little elderson I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.959 
do remember doing this little elderson I
think<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.180> circuit<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.719> am

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
think that's the first circuit I am

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
think that's the first circuit I am
I<00:00:44.239> get<00:00:45.239> long<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:46.230> I'll<00:00:46.379> ruin<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I get long because then I'll ruin the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
I get long because then I'll ruin the
music<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:48.180> eardrums<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.930> let's<00:00:49.200> move<00:00:49.410> on

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
music and your eardrums so let's move on

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.660 
music and your eardrums so let's move on
and<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.820> believe<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.410> only<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.399> star

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and I believe that there's only one star

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
and I believe that there's only one star
coin<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.600> cut

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
coin that you can get down here cut

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.959 
coin that you can get down here cut
themselves<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.680> extra<00:00:55.949> item<00:00:56.550> area

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
themselves with a extra item area

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.720 
themselves with a extra item area
reeking<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.199> any<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> only<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.070> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
reeking from which any and only one so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.709 
reeking from which any and only one so
yeah<00:01:00.359> how<00:01:00.539> direct<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:00.899> doing<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.199> too<00:01:02.719> I'm

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
yeah how direct been doing that too I'm

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
yeah how direct been doing that too I'm
not<00:01:04.110> sure<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.379> there's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> secret<00:01:04.949> exit<00:01:05.280> either

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
not sure if there's a secret exit either

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
not sure if there's a secret exit either
I<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:05.970> believe<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:06.930> string<00:01:07.140> at

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I don't believe there is no string at

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
I don't believe there is no string at
the<00:01:07.320> start<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.869> alright

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the start and we can get it alright

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
the start and we can get it alright
let's<00:01:10.229> move<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> hope<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
let's move and hope there we put this to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.420 
let's move and hope there we put this to
use

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
use

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.820

up<00:01:31.550> these<00:01:31.670> pipes<00:01:31.940> go<00:01:32.090> anywhere<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.480> on<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:33.020> don't

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
up these pipes go anywhere it on I don't

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.910 
up these pipes go anywhere it on I don't
think<00:01:33.590> they<00:01:33.710> do<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:35.320> at<00:01:36.320> least<00:01:36.440> I<00:01:36.620> know<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
think they do but at least I know the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.190 
think they do but at least I know the
side<00:01:37.130> ones<00:01:37.340> probably<00:01:37.640> don't<00:01:37.910> but<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.900> don't

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
side ones probably don't but I don't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.890 
side ones probably don't but I don't
want<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.470> have<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.310> worry<00:01:40.550> because<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.240> don't
