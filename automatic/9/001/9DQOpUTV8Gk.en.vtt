00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello to all happy to meet you 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.910
 for this new flash and the information 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.369
 of the day it is of course the draw 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 of the hen phase of the europa league 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.990
 which took place at midday and the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.770
 girondins from Bordeaux who will be in the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.020
 group b and who will face liverpool 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.780
 rubin kazan and if we navy and 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.900
 white qualified so last night 1 despite 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.539
 the defeat in kazakhstan against the cairo 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.300
 ap almaty de buzeins the Bordeaux goal 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.579
 is signed enzo crivelli I propose you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.800
 to listen to the reaction of the president 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.589
 Bordeaux jean louis triaud and scorer 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.199
 Enzo and Crivelli just after the dress and 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.719
 his brothers who joined strong center 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.870
 in front of the goal and I take it back well 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.350
 it's basically what 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.960
 yeah I'm learning madjer and that's okay 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.000
 very quickly so it's good for the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.850
 first goal let's say that was the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.129
 same match since it was equal after 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.190
 they scored the second so yeah that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.960
 we worried a bit after the end of 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.700
 match we held as long as we are in the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.720
 big mast but so it's me I find 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.119
 these moods and beneficial 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.350
 it's better to play either 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.420
 was more in the match 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.399
 I get better in the match and it's 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.619
 better i think yeah are going to be order 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.090
 here it is that it is a match 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.860
 important also it's going to say it's 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.350
 for the fans it's important 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.009
 so we'll have to go to 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 on top of that win hoping to get 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.080
 qualify with Rome was with guibert 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.250
 a beret to help players leave 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 with time these flaws is not very 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 long time 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.319
 does it have any particular value 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 it's even better 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.069
 yeah that's for sure we're going to say we're 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.539
 know well so that's done 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.880
 long time we play in CFA together 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.229
 so we'll say we know each other well so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.490
 it's always fun to win with 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.079
 I did not find 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.970
 febrile a few times tactically we 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.970
 was not enough to work around 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.640
 the opposing defense we do not have enough 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.830
 recovered two second balloons which against 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.560
 large, slightly slow stems are the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.590
 best good it's true that center and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.910
 it's been good since 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.270
 at 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.670
 the 30 meters of the touch edge makes 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.110
 just shone the two boys who make 2 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 0 5 km 96 tactics board times ago 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 May 15th , the profession returns 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 a little inexperience 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.800
 in the context there has been in addition to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110
 alico 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.500
 two good resignations there have been mistakes 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:51.250
 techniques but that's still some 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.250
 young players always have the right choice 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.159
 a free player in the hallway good 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.120
 bedding in the focused is expected with 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.610
 experience 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 improves for those two reactions 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.930
 we recapture resumption of competition in 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.970
