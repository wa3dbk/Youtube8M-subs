because<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.520> stuff<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.420> pricey<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
because this stuff is kind of pricey I

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.399 
because this stuff is kind of pricey I
decided<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.250> pick<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.820> foundation<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
decided to pick up a foundation and I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
decided to pick up a foundation and I
got<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.040> Revlon<00:02:02.430> Photoready<00:02:02.659> airbrush

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.119 
got the Revlon Photoready airbrush
effect<00:02:04.340> foundation<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
effect foundation and I think this is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.669

the<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:08.819> lightest<00:02:09.479> shade<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:10.229> says<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> lot
