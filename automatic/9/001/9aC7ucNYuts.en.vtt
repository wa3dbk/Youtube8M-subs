00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hello everyone today such a semi-announcement 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.660
 semi unpacking chinese smartphone 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.110
 cubot 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 from 168 which was purchased in the store 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 gearbest on unpacking the parcel myself 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.550
 did not take pictures because it is somewhat 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 minutes of fighting with several meters 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 pimply film nothing interesting there 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 there would only be a drag 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.520
 the video so I will show in essence 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.590
 unpacking the extraction of the smartphone itself 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 characteristics can be seen here 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.360
 android 4 4 5 inch screen on and ps 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 matrix two 8 megapixel cameras 5 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 megapixel by and large such 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 budget option with decent but also 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.930
 time is very impressive 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 characteristics naturally difficult 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.239
 expect that for $ 100 offered 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:14.549
 smartphone with some amazing 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:18.619
 imagination characteristics like this 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.619
 looks like the smartphone itself 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:38.720
 also here it appears it seems 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:47.500
 protective film it seems 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 Protective cover to rag cable 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:00.080
 battery charger battery 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:08.450
 by the way on so here we are 1900 milliamps 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:11.540
 hour and there is a small instruction but 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.610
 I will share my assumptions I think 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.040
 what in general 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.560
 characteristics must be confirmed 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.049
 but how will this work show itself 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.880
 smartphone honestly predict 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.220
 I can not yet because Chinese 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.959
 smartphone attitude people have very 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.620
 ambiguous myself first time 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.680
 I encounter such a Chinese smartphone 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.970
 so I do not dare to predict 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.609
 positive or negative will be 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 Actually review but I hope that 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.019
 it will still work correctly 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.890
 confirm the characteristics of the test 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 will be successful but generally optimistic 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.620
 option will be such that the smartphone 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.530
 will justify your 100 dollars and honestly 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 will confirm the characteristics but not 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.030
 exclude and the fact that some will come out 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.510
 flaws any glitches in general this announcement 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.900
 I'll post it five days before I take off 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.350
 actually review already with conclusions so 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.660
 if you see this to the fact that somewhere through 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.660
 week wait for a review on this smartphone
