00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.970
 very good friends stalin to this is the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.970
 problem that I have 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 1 2013 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 I love it because it says that 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.810
 but what happens if they are in the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.750
 normal mode we do not click to 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.920
 to show 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 and we started watching the video 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.600
 you start to eat the frames 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.140
 for the frames it begins to swallow 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.140
 frames 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.739
 it was worth 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840
 My memory 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 at 81% 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.780
 and it's a little annoying video 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 do not 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.130
 and what about the processor 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.430
 completely saturated 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 very well we put pause 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.159
 so 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.159
 I said a breath 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.130
 begins to breathe and then what 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.130
 we do is this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.190
 we activate the turbo mode and it tells you 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370
 Turbo 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.150
 it sends me one last peak the processor of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.440
 who is doing this and 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.090
 and we are running normally as dr 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 it is assumed that with this the majority of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 processes fall to the background 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.240
 or good rather they are arrested or 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.320
 really they set out but is not 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 well now we will see again 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.660
 the process is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.660
 doing nothing running 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.780
 but good 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.480
 we begin to swallow press 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.480
 and my processor again explodes 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.800
 but good is what I have to endure 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.800
 being now friends of taringa 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 well in fuchsia they will know that you are my 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.160
 doubt what I have to do 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.160
 anyway 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.670
 and it will improve my problem increase from 2 to 8 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.100
 gigas will improve my problem or rather it will 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.090
 will solve 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.090
 that is my question
