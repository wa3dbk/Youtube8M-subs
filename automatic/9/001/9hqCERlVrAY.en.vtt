00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
pixel x' to build up an image sprites
seem<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.990> away<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.590> games<00:01:10.799> more

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
like this and I did it it's essentially

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.180 
like this and I did it it's essentially
like<00:02:36.510> drawing<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.560> mean<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.069> little

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
like drawing I mean it's a little

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
like drawing I mean it's a little
different<00:02:38.670> since<00:02:38.879> you're<00:02:39.209> using<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.659> bunch<00:02:39.810> of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
different since you're using a bunch of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.080 
different since you're using a bunch of
little<00:02:40.110> pixels<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.579> that's<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:41.909> as

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
little pixels and you know that's not as

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.880 
little pixels and you know that's not as
detailed<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:43.019> why<00:02:43.319> don't<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:43.620> pick

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
detailed to know why don't you just pick

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.589 
detailed to know why don't you just pick
up<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.099> pen<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.849> draw<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.239> if<00:02:45.480> you're

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
up a pen and actually draw it if you're

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.410 
up a pen and actually draw it if you're
gonna<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:45.930> art<00:02:46.109> well<00:02:47.090> spriting<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.299> my

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
it's fun it's more simplistic and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's fun it's more simplistic and
mathematic<00:02:53.519> than<00:02:53.640> normal<00:02:54.030> drawing<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.890> curved

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
mathematic than normal drawing I curved

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.979 
mathematic than normal drawing I curved

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
rather than with a recolor we're just

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.890 
rather than with a recolor we're just

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
or something to go off of however

scratching<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.830> going<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.220> be<00:04:28.370> just<00:04:28.820> pure<00:04:29.420> out

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
scratching is going to be just pure out

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.600 
scratching is going to be just pure out
your<00:04:29.930> own<00:04:30.080> creation<00:04:30.740> or<00:04:31.220> at<00:04:31.310> least<00:04:31.430> that's

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
your own creation or at least that's

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.430 
your own creation or at least that's
what<00:04:31.670> it's<00:04:31.910> supposed<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.330> be<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.840> that's<00:04:33.290> what

I'm<00:04:33.560> going<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.740> be<00:04:33.830> teaching<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.340> today

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
I'm going to be teaching you here today

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.960 
I'm going to be teaching you here today
I'm<00:04:34.639> gonna<00:04:34.730> tell<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.060> how<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.300> start<00:04:35.690> often

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
I'm gonna tell you how to start often

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.950 
I'm gonna tell you how to start often
basically<00:04:37.970> go<00:04:38.120> through<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.600> we're<00:04:38.840> gonna

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
basically go through that we're gonna

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.650 
basically go through that we're gonna
start<00:04:39.470> off<00:04:39.650> if<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.040> planning<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.360> making<00:04:41.570> a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
start off if this planning and making a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.420 
start off if this planning and making a
concept<00:04:42.200> for<00:04:42.380> said<00:04:42.590> sprite<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.100> we're<00:04:43.250> ready

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
concept for said sprite so we're ready

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
concept for said sprite so we're ready
when<00:04:43.639> we're<00:04:43.760> going<00:04:44.030> into<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.450> then<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.139> next

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
when we're going into it then the next

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.070 
when we're going into it then the next
step<00:04:45.560> will<00:04:45.800> be<00:04:45.830> basically<00:04:46.490> creating<00:04:47.150> um<00:04:47.419> its

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
step will be basically creating um its

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.590 
step will be basically creating um its
form<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.800> figure<00:04:49.070> then<00:04:49.850> we'll<00:04:50.030> be<00:04:50.180> doing

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
form and figure then we'll be doing

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.290 
form and figure then we'll be doing
stuff<00:04:50.960> like<00:04:51.110> adding<00:04:51.620> color<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.669> then

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
stuff like adding color to it and then

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.940 
stuff like adding color to it and then
finally<00:04:53.690> after<00:04:53.810> all<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.050> we'll<00:04:54.410> get<00:04:54.710> all<00:04:54.830> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
finally after all that we'll get all the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.820 
finally after all that we'll get all the
little<00:04:55.100> little<00:04:55.550> bits<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:55.850> pieces<00:04:55.910> of

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
little little bits and pieces of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.900 
little little bits and pieces of
perfecting<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.950> making<00:04:58.250> sure<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.550> looks<00:04:58.610> right

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
perfecting it making sure it looks right

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.240 
perfecting it making sure it looks right
and<00:04:59.330> then<00:04:59.960> finally<00:05:00.410> actually<00:05:00.830> taking<00:05:01.160> your

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
and then finally actually taking your

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.860 
and then finally actually taking your
sprite<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.790> displaying<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.480> for<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.690> world

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
sprite and displaying it for the world

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.710 
sprite and displaying it for the world
to<00:05:03.080> see<00:05:03.260> now<00:05:04.250> essentially<00:05:04.700> there's<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.060> lot<00:05:05.450> of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
to see now essentially there's a lot of

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.960 
to see now essentially there's a lot of
different<00:05:06.020> things<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.290> could<00:05:06.350> scratch<00:05:07.250> there's

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
however for the most part this is going

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.520 
however for the most part this is going
to<00:06:23.030> cover<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.300> fakemon<00:06:23.570> but<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:24.080> skills<00:06:24.380> you

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
to cover the fakemon but the skills you

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.409 
to cover the fakemon but the skills you
learn<00:06:24.710> here<00:06:25.010> can<00:06:25.070> definitely<00:06:25.729> be<00:06:25.850> translated

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
learn here can definitely be translated
