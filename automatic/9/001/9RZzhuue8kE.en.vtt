00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.849
 welcome to the adrada in brief 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.949
 instants we will begin a journey through 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.110
 of the time that will help them understand 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.700
 better the space in which now it 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.610
 find 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.920
 during the itinerary you can observe the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.180
 evolution of this emblematic place that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.790
 it became a fortress and palace church 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 a place that already has more than 550 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.040
 years of history settle down and enjoy 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.040
 of this peculiar trip 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.360
 our story begins in the 13th century 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.340
 the border between the Castilian kingdom 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.680
 leonese and al-andalus is what 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.379
 sufficiently far away so the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.620
 TiÃ©tar Valley is already a territory 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.620
 safe 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.990
 those people founded at that time 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 some towns while consolidating 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.640
 other populations of previous creation 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.369
 thanks to the preserved documentation 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 we know that in 1250 instead of the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.960
 Adrada owned a parish church 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 located at the top of the hill 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.570
 torrejÃ³n the same one on which we now 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.720
 we find 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.900
 this church had three ships one 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.890
 central and two lateral 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.390
 and had a semicircular head 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.490
 years later in 1309 the temple was 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.030
 complete with a tower next to 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 apse we know the date of this new 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.430
 construction by an uncovered tombstone 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.550
 during archaeological excavations 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.190
 made in the courtyard cistern 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.680
 the cemetery according to the custom of the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.080
 era extended to both the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.500
 interior of the temple as around the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.770
 same the graves were simple graves 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.050
 excavated in the rock and some are 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 they signaled with a circular wake of 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.660
 stone look well in this church and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.200
 that is the first protagonist of the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.760
 story of the castle rightly 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.540
 we could say that it was the true 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.520
 germ of the fortress let's advance now 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.110
 in time to place us between 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.720
 late 14th century and early 15th 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.480
 the people of the locality presided by 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.210
 the church to which we have referred 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.210
 attend an important change the king 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.380
 enrique third has elevated the adrada to 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.530
 category of villa 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.050
 shortly after it becomes the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.780
 capital of a manor 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.270
 the first lord of the tier the mighty 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.030
 Constable of Castile Ruy Lopez 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.000
 davalos decides to transform the primitive 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.400
 church in a castle showing with 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.450
 it its dominion over the territory 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.360
 for this the door of the temple is blinded 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.930
 the graveyard disappears and the tower 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 the church is toppled over the apse 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.310
 build the homage tower so 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.580
 representative in this type of 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.130
 defensive constructions in the same way 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.980
 several smaller dependencies are built 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.530
 around a patio that already had 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.410
 cistern and the interior ships of the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.040
 church is compartmentalized to adapt 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.280
 to the new function finally all the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.950
 enclosure is surrounded by a barrier 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.269
 completed with pit cubes and a door 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.269
 with legalized bridge 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.060
 the evolution of systems and tactics 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.020
 military also influenced in a way 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.870
 decisive in the structure of the building to 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.880
 throughout the 15th century the walls were 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.760
 reinforce in order to support 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.129
 enemy fire 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.620
 loopholes are then opened for 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.319
 artillery installation and available 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.500
 a front door in the access to the enclosure 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.620
 main emphasizing the character 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.680
 defensive 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.050
 In this stage, a 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.930
 advanced tower on the wall the 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.930
 called albarrana tower in the corner 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.270
 northwest of the primitive church also 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.479
 one of the old cubes of the wall 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.600
 It is reinforced to house weapons 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.540
 siege gunners and defense by 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.840
 last and also within this period 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.770
 of important transformations opens 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.620
 to the west a postern is to say a 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.320
 discreet door used to enter or 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.590
 leave the castle without raising suspicion 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.660
 some the outer barrier would already have the 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.270
 image that we can contemplate in the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.030
 present during this moment 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.760
 historical so decisive for the appearance 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.550
 of the enclosure will be two the main ones 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.039
 owners of the castle the first of 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.740
 they don Alvaro de Luna that was made with 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.919
 the property after the fall of ruiz lopez 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.770
 give them and don antonio from the cave who 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.430
 started a new phase of reforms 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.090
 tending to turn it into a palace 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.160
 in the 16th century the sturdy castle is going 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.970
 giving way to a comfortable residence 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.010
 stately the south nave of the church is 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.310
 transforms into a large palatial room 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.950
 that will be part of the patio the 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.010
 interiors are decorated very much to the taste of the 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.350
 era with plaster plastered walls with 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.530
 tiles and floors decorated with 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.050
 tiles and tiles with a space 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.200
 of these characteristics contributed to 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.080
 exhibit the ignoble ce even more the 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.400
 power of the Lord of the stands 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.300
 possibly when the manor is 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:08.230
 becomes marquisate in 1570 the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:12.180
 reform works would have been completed 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.590
 during the subsequent centuries 17 and 18 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.690
 seems to slow down the momentum of 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.750
 transformation that had been so 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.300
 present in previous centuries if 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.680
 we except a guard post that 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.040
 is built next to the entrance 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.450
 the castle's main grounds just 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.450
 presents alterations 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.710
 from the 19th century a 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.930
 period of decline for the tier 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.180
 war of independence that he faced 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.270
 to Spain against the French armies 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.060
 and the suppression of the dominions fruit of 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.400
 a new political and social order with 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.280
 they took their abandonment and ruin 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.949
 in our days we have been able to recover 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.250

 and towers or when they contemplate its walls 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.960
 centenarians will be trapped by their 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.350
