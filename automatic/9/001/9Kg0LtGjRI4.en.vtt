00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.850
 Claustrophobia year a year for German into the deep of the claustrophobia 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.930
 Hell marriages 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.779
 dangerous rooms and narrow corridors 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.230
 In this two game game, a player assumes the leadership of the game 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.939
 People and the other player controls the poppy in hell 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.259
 and so, of course, trying to make life as difficult as possible for man 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.630
 depending on the scenario, one player has to try this way 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.419
 for example, to follow a draft and find the exit 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.340
 and to escape the labyrinth 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.870
 and the other player just tries 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.350
 to prevent that with his four months 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.660
 Players have plenty of playing material at their disposal 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510
 such as the scenarios for example 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.729
 with which warriors the player on the one hand can go to battle 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.629
 and what timons the other player may have available 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.010
 In addition, the players also have the opportunity among others 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.620
 equipment cards 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.649
 GA and use their own tent to their advantage 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.030
 although the rules include a few pages the basic ones 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.659
 Game rules pretty easy 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.970
 the players roll the dice 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.659
 and then decide how they want to use the dice on their Pablos 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.260
 making a player 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.240
 for example, how fast does it decide how fast 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 and steadfast his warriors are 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.920
 Reason that allows other players to make their team and faster, for example 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 can draw nasty event cards 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 just let the warrior fall mean 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.210
 through successful already "Iceman" and great game material such as 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 These stable game board elements and the beautifully painted game characters 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 Claustrophobia succeeds year an exciting and above all 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.789
 Moody to create the environment 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.820
 what lives on a very interesting litters mechanism 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.909
 Claustrophobia save years that were great games 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.369
 for two adventurers, ages 14+ 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.850
 but the English language should be great fun 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.099
 play until next time
