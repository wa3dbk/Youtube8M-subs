Foster<00:04:49.230> here<00:04:49.440> pleased<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.890> go<00:04:50.040> out<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.490> a

Foster here pleased to go out of a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.580 
Foster here pleased to go out of a
weekend<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.270> canoe<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.870> grabbed<00:04:52.230> myself

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
weekend in the canoe I grabbed myself

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.860 
weekend in the canoe I grabbed myself
free<00:04:52.860> Louis<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.730> basically<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.330> went<00:04:54.690> out

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
free Louis I basically just went out

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.620 
free Louis I basically just went out
paddling<00:04:55.680> around<00:04:55.920> in<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.130> canoe<00:04:56.370> and

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
paddling around in the canoe and

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.570 
paddling around in the canoe and
self-taught<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.380> picked<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.220> up<00:04:59.310> as<00:04:59.490> I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
self-taught I just picked it up as I

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.580 
self-taught I just picked it up as I
went<00:04:59.700> along<00:04:59.790> the<00:05:00.660> most<00:05:00.870> important<00:05:01.380> thing<00:05:01.470> in

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
went along the most important thing in

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.320 
went along the most important thing in
my<00:05:01.740> fishing<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.340> suppose<00:05:02.700> is<00:05:02.970> probably<00:05:03.240> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
my fishing I suppose is probably a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.510 
my fishing I suppose is probably a
casting<00:05:03.840> accuracy<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.890> think<00:05:05.130> that's<00:05:05.340> just

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
casting accuracy and I think that's just

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.680 
casting accuracy and I think that's just
to<00:05:05.640> do<00:05:05.760> with<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:05.970> area<00:05:06.150> I've<00:05:06.420> grown<00:05:06.660> up

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
to do with the area I've grown up

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.140 
to do with the area I've grown up
fishing<00:05:07.290> Foster<00:05:07.830> all<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.070> time<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.970> you're

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
fishing Foster all the time if you're

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.000 
fishing Foster all the time if you're
not<00:05:09.210> within<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.990> couple<00:05:10.200> of<00:05:10.410> inches<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.740> where

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
not within a couple of inches of where

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.260 
not within a couple of inches of where
you<00:05:11.100> want<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.640> you're<00:05:11.970> not<00:05:12.060> going<00:05:12.210> to

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
you want it to be you're not going to

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.570 
you want it to be you're not going to
get<00:05:12.360> those<00:05:12.510> bites<00:05:12.870> time<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.860> water<00:05:14.100> is

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
get those bites time on the water is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.340 
get those bites time on the water is
probably<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:15.030> most<00:05:15.120> important<00:05:15.750> thing<00:05:15.900> when<00:05:16.320> I

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
probably the most important thing when I

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.530 
probably the most important thing when I
was<00:05:16.560> 16<00:05:16.980> 17<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.520> used<00:05:17.730> to<00:05:17.790> spend<00:05:18.030> hours<00:05:18.510> and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
was 16 17 I used to spend hours and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.050 
was 16 17 I used to spend hours and
hours<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.050> hours<00:05:19.440> out<00:05:19.650> perfecting<00:05:20.640> different

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
hours and hours out perfecting different

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.300 
hours and hours out perfecting different
techniques<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.870> practicing<00:05:22.830> little<00:05:23.100> things

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
techniques and practicing little things

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.560 
techniques and practicing little things
that<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.550> could<00:05:23.730> do<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:23.880> get<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.270> competitive

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
that I could do to get that competitive

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.870 
that I could do to get that competitive
edge<00:05:24.930> now<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:26.010> guess<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.370> just<00:05:26.520> becomes<00:05:26.790> a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
edge now I guess it just becomes a

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.730 
edge now I guess it just becomes a
second<00:05:27.240> nature<00:05:27.270> after<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.870> while<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.380> go<00:05:28.500> into

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
second nature after a while you go into

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.770 
second nature after a while you go into
a<00:05:28.770> tournament<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.550> you've<00:05:30.270> just<00:05:30.420> got<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.570> pick

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
a tournament and you've just got to pick

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.180 
a tournament and you've just got to pick
up<00:05:30.930> those<00:05:31.080> little<00:05:31.410> tricks<00:05:31.590> as<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.890> go<00:05:32.040> along

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
up those little tricks as you go along

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.070 
up those little tricks as you go along
then<00:05:32.550> whether<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.880> be<00:05:33.000> a<00:05:33.030> little<00:05:33.330> skip<00:05:33.630> casting

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
then whether it be a little skip casting

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.050 
then whether it be a little skip casting
under<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.380> wharf<00:05:34.680> or<00:05:35.070> whether<00:05:35.820> you're<00:05:35.970> not

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
under a wharf or whether you're not

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.670 
under a wharf or whether you're not
actually<00:05:36.390> casting<00:05:36.930> at<00:05:37.050> fish<00:05:37.230> you're<00:05:37.440> throwing

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
actually casting at fish you're throwing

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.710 
actually casting at fish you're throwing
pass<00:05:38.070> fish<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:38.760> don't<00:05:39.000> spook<00:05:39.330> them<00:05:39.540> and

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
pass fish so you don't spook them and

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.360 
pass fish so you don't spook them and
pulling<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.140> back<00:05:40.170> to<00:05:40.500> them<00:05:40.650> just<00:05:41.220> those

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
pulling it back to them just those

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.350 
pulling it back to them just those
little<00:05:41.520> things<00:05:41.670> can<00:05:42.000> make<00:05:42.120> all<00:05:42.270> the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
little things can make all the

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:51.220 
little things can make all the
difference<00:05:49.190> just<00:05:50.190> twenty<00:05:50.490> five<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:50.910> half
