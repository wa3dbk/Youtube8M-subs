00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
sexier speaking of game modes we

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
sexier speaking of game modes we
decrease<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> point<00:01:45.810> values<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.409> defense<00:01:46.799> on

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
decrease the point values for defense on

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
decrease the point values for defense on
hard<00:01:47.280> point<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> capture<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> flag<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.110> guys

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hard point and capture the flag you guys

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.469 
hard point and capture the flag you guys
are<00:01:49.500> farming<00:01:49.979> score<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.790> hard<00:01:51.180> point

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
are farming score like it was hard point

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
are farming score like it was hard point
from<00:01:51.659> black<00:01:51.899> ops<00:01:52.170> 2<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.070> dip<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.520> toe

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
from black ops 2 you just dip your toe

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.730 
from black ops 2 you just dip your toe
down<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> pool<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.689> grab<00:01:54.899> kill<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.439> extra

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
down in the pool and grab kill for extra

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.399 
down in the pool and grab kill for extra
score<00:01:56.040> plus<00:01:56.610> defense<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.780> easier<00:01:57.990> than

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
score plus defense is a lot easier than

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.319 
score plus defense is a lot easier than
offense<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.490> camp<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> fucking

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
offense you just camp in a fucking

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.230 
offense you just camp in a fucking
corner<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.560> descent<00:02:02.159> devises<00:02:02.729> camping

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
corner so this descent devises camping

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.690 
corner so this descent devises camping
even<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.590> lower<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> points<00:02:05.520> for

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
even more we also lower the points for

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
even more we also lower the points for
returning<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.210> flag<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> killing<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> flag

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
returning a flag and killing the flag

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
returning a flag and killing the flag
carrier<00:02:07.649> giving<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> even<00:02:08.520> less<00:02:08.910> incentive

to ptfo on capture the flag capture the
flag<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> shitty<00:02:12.900> game<00:02:13.140> oh

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
flag is a shitty game oh

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200 
flag is a shitty game oh
anyway<00:02:13.650> I'm<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.400> supposed<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.730> say<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.030> we

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
anyway I'm not supposed to say that we

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.850 
anyway I'm not supposed to say that we
also<00:02:15.390> made<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:15.900> changes<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.410> completely

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
also made some changes to the completely

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.040 
also made some changes to the completely
unnecessary<00:02:17.300> epilogue<00:02:18.300> sequence<00:02:18.840> by

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
unnecessary epilogue sequence by

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650 
unnecessary epilogue sequence by
modifying<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.770> dropship<00:02:20.580> apparently<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> was

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
modifying the dropship apparently it was

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.080 
modifying the dropship apparently it was
too<00:02:21.930> easy<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.710> kill<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.160> dropship<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.970> we

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
too easy to kill the dropship so we

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.060 
too easy to kill the dropship so we
reduced<00:02:24.450> cluster<00:02:24.900> missals<00:02:25.080> damage<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
reduced cluster missals damage to it and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.670 
reduced cluster missals damage to it and
it's<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:26.940> responsive<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.660> pilots<00:02:28.050> what's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's more responsive to pilots what's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's more responsive to pilots what's
that<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.370> dropship<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.030> almost<00:02:30.240> impossible

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that the dropship is almost impossible

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.900 
that the dropship is almost impossible
to<00:02:30.960> kill<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:31.770> fuck<00:02:32.100> me<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.520> looks<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.820> we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
to kill well fuck me it looks like we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.000 
to kill well fuck me it looks like we
got<00:02:33.030> another<00:02:33.390> thing<00:02:33.780> wrong<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.500> something<00:02:34.860> we

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
got another thing wrong but something we

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
got another thing wrong but something we
did<00:02:35.310> get<00:02:35.640> right<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> certain<00:02:36.600> burn<00:02:36.990> cards

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
did get right is that certain burn cards

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.980 
did get right is that certain burn cards
can<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.680> exploited<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.490> multiple<00:02:38.910> use<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.780> did

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
can be exploited for multiple use we did

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.870 
can be exploited for multiple use we did

shit<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.310> exploit<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> could<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.360> broken

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
shit to exploit if it could be broken

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.660 
shit to exploit if it could be broken
some<00:02:49.080> clown<00:02:49.410> will<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.070> post<00:02:50.250> videos

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
anything we patch the mega turret to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.800 
anything we patch the mega turret to
make<00:02:55.860> its<00:02:56.040> healthful<00:02:56.580> after<00:02:56.940> hacking<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.450> even

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
make its healthful after hacking it even

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
make its healthful after hacking it even
though<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.140> makes<00:02:58.320> no<00:02:58.530> fucking<00:02:58.740> sense<00:02:58.980> you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910

though that makes no fucking sense you
could<00:03:00.030> also<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:00.450> hack<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.930> properly<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.560> all

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
could also now hack it properly in all

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.310 
could also now hack it properly in all
instances<00:03:02.040> which<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> bug<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:03.300> fix<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:04.170> added

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.500 
instances which is a bug we fix we added
some<00:03:04.500> Titan<00:03:05.100> viagra<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.060> it'll<00:03:06.180> always

some map exploits so you little fucks
can't<00:03:11.850> glitch<00:03:12.210> inside<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> geometry<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
can't glitch inside of the geometry so

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.620 
can't glitch inside of the geometry so
you<00:03:13.980> probably<00:03:14.160> don't<00:03:14.400> know<00:03:14.460> geometry<00:03:14.940> anyways

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
