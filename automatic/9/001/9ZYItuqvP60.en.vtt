TV<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> acts<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> controller<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
TV so this acts like a controller and it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.460 
TV so this acts like a controller and it
becomes<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.260> know<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.820> console<00:02:17.820> for<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.090> TV

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
becomes a you know a console for your TV

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.450 
becomes a you know a console for your TV
so<00:02:19.470> anyway<00:02:19.710> let's<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.010> start<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
so anyway let's just start with the

so anyway let's just start with the
video<00:02:20.820> player<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.990> know<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
video player and like you know this is

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.900 
video player and like you know this is
your<00:02:25.500> typical<00:02:25.680> sun+<00:02:26.310> chipset<00:02:26.820> has<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.300> very

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
your typical sun+ chipset has like very

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.600 
your typical sun+ chipset has like very
ugly<00:02:29.910> UI<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.450> i<00:02:30.780> would<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> put<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.610> but

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
ugly UI as i would like to put it but

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.030 
ugly UI as i would like to put it but
for<00:02:33.300> video<00:02:33.870> playback<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.530> actually<00:02:34.890> has

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
for video playback this actually has

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.930 
for video playback this actually has
some<00:02:35.690> poise<00:02:36.690> oh<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:38.460> actually<00:02:38.730> quite<00:02:38.850> good

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
some poise oh it's actually quite good

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.960 
some poise oh it's actually quite good
for<00:02:39.240> video<00:02:39.510> playback<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.440> let's<00:02:40.680> say<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.640> TV

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
for video playback so let's say the TV

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.420 
for video playback so let's say the TV
out<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.300> actually<00:02:42.480> generally<00:02:43.260> quite<00:02:44.010> decent

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
out is actually generally quite decent

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.180 
out is actually generally quite decent
quality<00:02:45.320> let's<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> playbacks<00:02:46.890> quite

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
quality let's see the playbacks quite

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:08.130 
quality let's see the playbacks quite
smooth<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.030> fast<00:02:57.270> forward

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:17.410 

muted<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:12.250> because<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> volume<00:03:16.420> hearing

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
muted it because the volume hearing

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.610 
muted it because the volume hearing
angles<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:17.810> all<00:03:17.840> right<00:03:18.140> i<00:03:18.170> mean<00:03:18.349> just
