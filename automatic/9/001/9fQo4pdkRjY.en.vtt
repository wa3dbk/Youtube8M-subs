00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.090
 Buchmann Stosur Speed ​​- Hot Pursuit the top striker 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.569
 and Dieter Bohlen

 Cindy Pöschel bike right this program means here is uses and and 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.199
 and 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.230
 and do not come speak 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.689
 stands 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.019
 support there 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.960
 Anyway, this brings in the way of the connection 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 description 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.649
 then there is German Tom Boonen 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.659
 for download 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.820
 procontra the landlords 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 still no more questions Jefferies through 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 you have to install 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.740
 / compressed 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
 but only by the way what else Ska pays attention to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 Top earners that it's fast 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.230
 now is betting debt 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 not only on points second 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.690
 Irmscher Illertissen had been fit and able to do what Tiffert was able to do 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.520
 Berberoglu meant 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.510
 the camerata you have to speak 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 like Alexa 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.680
 Nevertheless, everyone comes across clearly 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.590
 what to say Homestory undergo now 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.110
 and more seriously the record 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.320
 Lyon is waiting 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200
 Separating back 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 that also looks like honey 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.560
 grows 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.960
 so now can Basel 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420
 Lopez to «Leo» 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 support 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 when we use it first corner 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.290
 the next summer party 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 did not use that 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.520
 you would have Schmuser Cheerful going on 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.130
 since this program Foster time I am 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.620
 in both sets Streetfighter will 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.990
 pulled up with the dome 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 and now 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.120
 would 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.130
 when it gets dark the centerpiece of the then approaching 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.240
 next 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 this Project IP Engine 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.749
 was next 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.059
 Hopsten 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.429
 It's important up here on the left 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:17.689
 the six percent 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.409
 Test duration super nice 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.869
 buy red-green vigorously 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.369
 after that, in 10 you would have to 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.379
 With this cliché the document became frustration the magazine 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.429
 finally he plays - like 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.329
 This should be the big ones fast 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.329
 very practical APA I recommend you 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.419
 upwind 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.819
 five years ago 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.979
 if we were thirsting for the Wehrmacht 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.239
 still fifth 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.669
 thickest Abdul Jalil 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.399
 the four weeks already that the 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.399
 now first Ex Transport here you see very fast 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.109
 everything happens so fast 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 and increased 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.869
 this is a bit slower 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.869
 that quickly filled the best 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.869
 which from the 8 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.129
 it is too fast 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.429
 So now I here German market at level 5 to 50 0 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.229
 Signed Franken 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.559
 what and yes what I wanted 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.579
 Customer loyalty or with ribbons 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.539
 so impressive the tables 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.729
 Science system wall unit what is love 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.659
 and that is the tangent 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.139
 36 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.419
 Send school hours of blocking to the power-play source 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.589
 I hope 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 legally Gulbis continue Wolfen and Co 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.650
 and yet zero number continues course to the Dieter Zetsche warship 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.509
 recent 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.509
 Rosenthal has over 1000 tests on this culture 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.739
 then the picturesque Fluterschen on the part of greeting words with him 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.639
 Facts created 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.269
 and post-skirt bypassing the played finds Dost can still only improve 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.409
 to look for something like that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 October can be started 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.619
 whoever is not present will eventually become increasingly attractive 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.050
 Lorenzi off 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.460
 I did yesterday
