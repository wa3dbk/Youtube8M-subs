00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
hard drive and we'll start off with that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.030 
hard drive and we'll start off with that
first<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.909> hard<00:01:33.360> drive<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.860> in

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
first so the hard drive is right here in

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.420 
first so the hard drive is right here in
the<00:01:35.610> front<00:01:35.880> lower<00:01:36.479> left<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.619> system<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the front lower left of the system if

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
the front lower left of the system if
you<00:01:38.520> turned<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:40.200> screws

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
going to have to flip the system over

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660

in screw the screws back on so you guys

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.510 
in screw the screws back on so you guys
that<00:02:34.440> are<00:02:34.470> watching<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.890> video<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
that are watching this video for that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.010 
that are watching this video for that
hard<00:02:35.730> drive<00:02:35.910> removal<00:02:36.209> there<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
hard drive removal there it is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440 
hard drive removal there it is
now<00:02:37.920> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.280> wanted<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.640> upgrade<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.060> RAM<00:02:39.209> on

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
now if you wanted to upgrade the RAM on

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.780 
now if you wanted to upgrade the RAM on
this<00:02:39.600> system<00:02:40.050> you'd<00:02:40.830> start<00:02:41.250> off<00:02:41.430> by<00:02:41.760> just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
this system you'd start off by just

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.580 
this system you'd start off by just
unscrewing<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.440> plate<00:02:43.770> here<00:02:45.590> I'm

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
unscrewing this little plate here I'm

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.050 
unscrewing this little plate here I'm
going<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:46.980> through<00:02:47.280> all<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.550> screws

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
going to go through all the screws

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.990 
going to go through all the screws
there's<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.630> think<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.930> total<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.350> four<00:02:50.000> there's

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's I think a total of four there's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.430 
there's I think a total of four there's
one<00:02:51.620> two<00:02:53.269> three<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:56.370> should<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.850> four

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
one two three and we should have four

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.770 
one two three and we should have four
once<00:02:58.440> let's<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.090> enough

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
once let's see if that's enough

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.870 
once let's see if that's enough
that<00:03:01.620> are<00:03:01.739> not<00:03:01.830> enough

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
that are not enough

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.530 
that are not enough
I<00:03:05.700> want<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> make<00:03:06.880> sure<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.210> all<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
I want to make sure you get all the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.930 
I want to make sure you get all the
screws<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.110> makes<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.560> lot<00:03:08.770> easier<00:03:08.830> for<00:03:09.250> you

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.820 

black<00:03:12.940> screws<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.690> black<00:03:13.960> panel<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.530> course

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
black screws on a black panel of course

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.430 
black screws on a black panel of course
we're<00:03:15.040> going<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.990> there<00:03:16.990> we<00:03:17.140> go

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
we're going to be there we go

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.460 
we're going to be there we go
so<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.220> pops<00:03:18.430> off<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:19.570> put<00:03:19.810> my<00:03:19.960> screwdriver

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
so it pops off just put my screwdriver

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.930 
so it pops off just put my screwdriver
in<00:03:20.940> pop<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> panel<00:03:22.540> right<00:03:22.720> off<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.940> it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
in pop the panel right off and it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.460 
in pop the panel right off and it
reveals<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:27.310> processor<00:03:28.470> processors

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
reveals the processor processors

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.310 
reveals the processor processors
underneath<00:03:29.830> here<00:03:30.220> our<00:03:30.370> heatsink<00:03:31.300> we<00:03:32.170> have

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
underneath here our heatsink we have

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.970 
underneath here our heatsink we have
access<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.520> wireless<00:03:34.210> LAN<00:03:34.480> card<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.140> our

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
access to the wireless LAN card and our

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.100 
access to the wireless LAN card and our
memory<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:37.000> way<00:03:37.120> our<00:03:37.270> memory<00:03:37.570> comes<00:03:37.870> out

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
memory and the way our memory comes out

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.390 
memory and the way our memory comes out
is<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.710> pinch<00:03:39.580> these<00:03:39.820> little<00:03:40.090> side

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
is you just pinch these little side

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.640 
is you just pinch these little side
stoppers<00:03:42.400> or<00:03:42.550> whatever<00:03:42.790> those<00:03:43.000> are<00:03:43.410> your<00:03:44.410> RAM

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
stoppers or whatever those are your RAM

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.530 
stoppers or whatever those are your RAM
just<00:03:44.980> comes<00:03:45.220> right<00:03:45.340> out<00:03:45.550> just<00:03:45.670> like<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.360> so

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
just comes right out just like that so

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.210 
just comes right out just like that so
if<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.720> wanted<00:03:46.960> to<00:03:47.080> upgrade<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:47.590> ram<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.130> if

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
if you wanted to upgrade this ram and if

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.520 
if you wanted to upgrade this ram and if
you<00:03:48.370> were<00:03:48.460> on<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.610> 64-bit<00:03:49.360> operating<00:03:49.870> system<00:03:50.380> I

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
you were on a 64-bit operating system I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.610 
you were on a 64-bit operating system I
believe<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.490> dell<00:03:51.700> inspiron<00:03:52.140> 1545<00:03:53.140> will

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
believe that dell inspiron 1545 will

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.340 
believe that dell inspiron 1545 will
accept<00:03:54.340> eight<00:03:54.580> gigabytes<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.750> if<00:03:56.020> it<00:03:56.140> does

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
accept eight gigabytes so if it does

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.670 
accept eight gigabytes so if it does
great<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.250> just<00:03:57.460> got<00:03:57.700> an<00:03:57.820> RAM<00:03:58.150> upgrade<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.930> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
great you just got an RAM upgrade and it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320 
great you just got an RAM upgrade and it
was<00:03:59.890> simple<00:04:00.280> enough<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.760> didn't<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.180> go

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
was simple enough you didn't have to go

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.000 
was simple enough you didn't have to go
take<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.810> big<00:04:02.050> box<00:04:02.230> store<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.650> spend

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
take it to a big box store and spend

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.590 
take it to a big box store and spend
lots<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.400> money<00:04:05.790> I'm<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:07.000> going<00:04:07.120> ahead<00:04:07.180> I'm

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
lots of money I'm just going ahead I'm

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.120 
lots of money I'm just going ahead I'm
going<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:07.930> ahead<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.230> put<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.770> RAM<00:04:08.920> back

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
going to go ahead and put the RAM back

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.930 
going to go ahead and put the RAM back
in<00:04:09.340> there<00:04:09.520> put<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:09.880> panel<00:04:10.150> back<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:11.760> one<00:04:12.760> more

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
in there put this panel back on one more

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
that's right next to the RAM this guy

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.660 
that's right next to the RAM this guy
what<00:04:24.670> does<00:04:24.850> he<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.530> he<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:27.070> will<00:04:27.370> release

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
what does he do he actually will release

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.410 
what does he do he actually will release
our<00:04:28.000> optical<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.190> there<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.150> we

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
our optical and there it is so we

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.060 
our optical and there it is so we
already<00:04:31.510> have<00:04:31.780> three<00:04:32.140> major<00:04:32.320> four<00:04:32.860> major

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
already have three major four major

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.370 
already have three major four major
components<00:04:33.730> here<00:04:33.880> guys<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.420> we<00:04:34.510> can<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:35.350> have

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
components here guys that we can we have

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.920 
components here guys that we can we have
access<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:36.160> we<00:04:36.700> have<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:36.970> hard<00:04:37.180> drive<00:04:37.480> we<00:04:37.900> have

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
access to we have the hard drive we have

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.540 
access to we have the hard drive we have
your<00:04:38.170> optical<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:39.190> have<00:04:39.340> RAM<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:41.130> we<00:04:42.130> have<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
your optical we have RAM and we have the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.700 
your optical we have RAM and we have the
processor<00:04:43.330> which<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:44.080> again<00:04:44.410> right

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
processor which is just again right

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.530 
processor which is just again right
under<00:04:44.950> here<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.940> put<00:04:46.090> everything<00:04:46.300> back

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
under here so to put everything back

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.420 
under here so to put everything back
together<00:04:46.750> I'm<00:04:47.050> going<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.230> slide<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.920> optical

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
together I'm going to slide the optical

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.830 
together I'm going to slide the optical
drive<00:04:49.000> back<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:50.580> give<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.760> firm<00:04:52.330> tug<00:04:52.660> and

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
drive back in give it a firm tug and

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.170 
drive back in give it a firm tug and
they're<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:53.290> firm<00:04:54.160> push<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.120> know

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
they're just so firm push just so I know

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.920 
they're just so firm push just so I know
he<00:04:55.420> connects<00:04:55.810> properly<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:57.750> we'll<00:04:58.750> go<00:04:58.840> ahead

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
he connects properly and we'll go ahead

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.390 
he connects properly and we'll go ahead
and<00:04:59.050> put<00:04:59.290> this<00:04:59.440> screw<00:04:59.830> back<00:05:00.040> in<00:05:00.100> there<00:05:02.250> get<00:05:03.250> off

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
and put this screw back in there get off

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.770 
and put this screw back in there get off
the<00:05:03.520> tighten<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:03.880> too<00:05:04.030> tight<00:05:04.300> now<00:05:04.540> you're<00:05:04.690> not

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
the tighten it too tight now you're not

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.890 
the tighten it too tight now you're not
going<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.910> know<00:05:07.000> break<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.540> or<00:05:07.750> anything

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
going to you know break it or anything

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.620 
going to you know break it or anything
so<00:05:08.380> you<00:05:08.410> don't<00:05:08.710> want<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.980> do<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:10.510> we'll

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
so you don't want to do that and we'll

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.170 
so you don't want to do that and we'll
just<00:05:10.780> start<00:05:10.990> screwing<00:05:11.380> these<00:05:11.680> back<00:05:12.070> on<00:05:12.340> like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
just start screwing these back on like

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.090 
just start screwing these back on like
so<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:16.410> don't<00:05:17.410> know<00:05:17.680> if<00:05:17.770> there's<00:05:17.950> any

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
so I don't know if there's any

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.010 
so I don't know if there's any

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
particular water that I need to go in I

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.730 
particular water that I need to go in I
just<00:05:20.169> know<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:20.800> some<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:22.080> push<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.229> panel<00:05:23.590> in

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
just know that some I push the panel in

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.300 
just know that some I push the panel in
it<00:05:24.100> pops<00:05:24.520> down<00:05:25.410> I'm<00:05:26.410> not<00:05:26.560> going<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.770> complicate
