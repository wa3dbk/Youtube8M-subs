let's<00:01:30.890> overlay<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.460> two<00:01:31.490> shots<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.149> can

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
let's overlay the two shots so you can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.539 
let's overlay the two shots so you can
get<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> better<00:01:32.630> look<00:01:39.100> notice<00:01:40.100> how<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.280> balls

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
get a better look notice how the balls

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.520 
get a better look notice how the balls
separate<00:01:41.000> after<00:01:41.149> they<00:01:41.390> clear<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> heads<00:01:41.960> the
