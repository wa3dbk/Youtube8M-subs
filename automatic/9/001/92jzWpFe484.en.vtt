00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
I did a test in this configuration using

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
I did a test in this configuration using
one<00:00:35.399> fluid<00:00:35.700> ounce<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.270> methanol<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:40.350> got

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
one fluid ounce of methanol and it got

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.510 
one fluid ounce of methanol and it got
two<00:00:40.710> cups<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.070> water<00:00:41.280> starting<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:42.110> 60<00:00:43.110> degrees

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.650 
as yesterday but I didn't think it would
be<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.860> did<00:03:10.730> think<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.120> water<00:03:11.330> would<00:03:11.510> come

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
be but I did think the water would come

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.570 
be but I did think the water would come
to<00:03:11.840> boil<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.230> little<00:03:12.260> bit<00:03:12.590> faster<00:03:13.160> because<00:03:13.310> it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
to boil a little bit faster because it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.410 
to boil a little bit faster because it
was<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> bigger<00:03:13.970> flame<00:03:16.180> although<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.670> when<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
was a bigger flame although the when the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.210 
was a bigger flame although the when the
economizer<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:22.070> there<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.840> get<00:03:24.080> Jets<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
economizer is in there you get Jets the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.040 
economizer is in there you get Jets the
Jets<00:03:25.250> coming<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:26.060> hitting<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.390> bottom<00:03:26.750> plus

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
Jets coming up hitting the bottom plus

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.570 
Jets coming up hitting the bottom plus
the<00:03:27.260> flame<00:03:27.530> that's<00:03:27.709> in<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.670> outer<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:30.580> okay

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
the flame that's in the outer can okay

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.380 
the flame that's in the outer can okay
as<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> recap<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.660> was<00:03:33.350> two<00:03:33.500> cups<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.890> water

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
as a recap that was two cups of water

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.300 
as a recap that was two cups of water
starting<00:03:35.390> at<00:03:35.480> 59<00:03:35.959> degrees<00:03:35.989> room<00:03:36.739> temperature

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
starting at 59 degrees room temperature

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.560 
starting at 59 degrees room temperature
is<00:03:37.930> 45<00:03:38.930> humidity<00:03:39.560> 53<00:03:40.330> cloudy<00:03:41.330> out<00:03:41.600> but<00:03:41.989> still

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
is 45 humidity 53 cloudy out but still

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.570 
is 45 humidity 53 cloudy out but still
what<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.600> came<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> boil<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.560> five<00:03:46.340> minutes

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
what it came to a boil in five minutes

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.570 
what it came to a boil in five minutes
ten<00:03:46.940> seconds<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.720> then<00:03:48.290> ran<00:03:48.680> out<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.220> seven

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
ten seconds and then ran out in seven

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.070 
ten seconds and then ran out in seven
minutes<00:03:49.880> 55<00:03:50.799> so<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:51.830> would<00:03:52.100> think<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.519> is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
minutes 55 so I would think this is

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.180 
minutes 55 so I would think this is
pretty<00:03:54.080> much<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.730> alcohol<00:03:55.730> glut<00:03:57.010> hmm<00:03:58.010> I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
pretty much of a alcohol glut hmm I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.270 
pretty much of a alcohol glut hmm I
guess<00:03:58.430> my<00:03:58.790> next<00:03:58.850> test<00:03:59.560> should<00:04:00.560> be<00:04:00.620> testing<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
guess my next test should be testing it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.789 
guess my next test should be testing it
the<00:04:01.400> way<00:04:01.549> they<00:04:01.760> meant<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.150> be<00:04:02.350> with<00:04:03.350> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
the way they meant it to be with the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:10.180 
the way they meant it to be with the
quart<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.760> water<00:04:06.400> yeah<00:04:07.400> court<00:04:08.829> they're<00:04:09.829> saying

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
quart of water yeah court they're saying

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.350 
quart of water yeah court they're saying
that<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:12.320> court<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.739> water<00:04:12.970> with<00:04:13.970> one<00:04:14.209> ounce

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
that the court of water with one ounce

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.409 
that the court of water with one ounce
of<00:04:14.570> fuel<00:04:14.920> should<00:04:15.920> come<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.280> boil<00:04:16.579> in<00:04:16.850> seven

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
of fuel should come to a boil in seven

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.900 
of fuel should come to a boil in seven
and<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.570> half<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.959> nine<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.350> half<00:04:18.380> minutes

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
and a half to nine and a half minutes

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.729 
and a half to nine and a half minutes
that<00:04:19.910> time<00:04:20.180> difference<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.930> depending<00:04:21.530> on<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
that time difference is depending on the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.100 
that time difference is depending on the
wind<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.190> stuff<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:23.120> these<00:04:23.360> tests<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.840> haven't

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
wind and stuff and these tests I haven't

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.260 
wind and stuff and these tests I haven't
been<00:04:24.200> using<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.740> windscreen<00:04:25.060> because<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.180> I

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
been using the windscreen because if I

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.230 
been using the windscreen because if I
don't<00:04:26.330> talk<00:04:26.810> there's<00:04:27.140> no<00:04:27.350> wind<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:27.800> here<00:04:28.240> but

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
don't talk there's no wind in here but

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.940 
don't talk there's no wind in here but
seven<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.169> half<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.530> nine<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.890> half

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
seven and a half to nine and a half

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.330 
seven and a half to nine and a half
minutes<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.580> get<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.760> court<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.270> boil<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.840> then

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
minutes to get a court to boil and then

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.940 
minutes to get a court to boil and then
continue<00:04:34.340> on<00:04:34.370> for<00:04:34.760> 18<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.240> 20<00:04:35.750> minutes<00:04:35.930> for<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
continue on for 18 to 20 minutes for the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.190 
continue on for 18 to 20 minutes for the
simmer<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.210> guess<00:04:38.419> that'll<00:04:38.690> be<00:04:38.810> my<00:04:38.960> next

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
simmer so I guess that'll be my next

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.689 
simmer so I guess that'll be my next
test

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.930 

alright<00:04:42.699> so<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.720> hope<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.440> helps<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:45.039> thank<00:04:45.820> you
