lot but raise them up a little bit will

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.550 
lot but raise them up a little bit will

just<00:02:30.269> because<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.720> never<00:02:30.900> happens<00:02:31.319> they

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.690 
just because that never happens they

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the time maybe they will okay let's go

40 rushing broken tackles 5 run blocking
35<00:02:49.769> fumbles<00:02:50.610> 35<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.079> can<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.500> best

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829

this<00:02:53.190> adds<00:02:53.459> up<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.579> 75<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.209> adds<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:55.130> 74

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
this adds up to 75 this adds up to 74

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.479 
this adds up to 75 this adds up to 74
this

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
this

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.520 
this
I<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.180> run<00:02:57.360> blocking<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.049> fumbles

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
I like the run blocking and the fumbles

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.410 
I like the run blocking and the fumbles
I<00:02:58.709> don't<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.069> dropping<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.849> as<00:02:59.940> much<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.390> I

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
I don't like dropping it as much so I

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
I don't like dropping it as much so I
kind<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.750> changed<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:02.040> broken

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
kind of changed that up the broken

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.020 
kind of changed that up the broken
tackles<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.849> 5<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.989> very<00:03:04.230> important<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
tackles on 5 it's very important and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.059 
tackles on 5 it's very important and
mainly<00:03:06.030> because<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.569> get<00:03:06.959> good<00:03:07.290> lanes<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.920> I

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
mainly because I get good lanes and I

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.440 
mainly because I get good lanes and I
don't<00:03:08.130> need<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.370> break<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.700> many<00:03:08.849> tackles<00:03:09.329> if

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
don't need to break that many tackles if

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.660 
don't need to break that many tackles if
I<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.660> get<00:03:09.780> into<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.049> open<00:03:10.430> that's<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.579> my

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
I can get into the open that's just my

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.559 
I can get into the open that's just my
take<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:13.610> pass<00:03:14.610> defense<00:03:14.970> reaction<00:03:15.420> time

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
take on that pass defense reaction time

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.420 
take on that pass defense reaction time
10<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.620> pretty<00:03:16.860> good<00:03:16.920> reaction<00:03:17.160> time

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
10 I have pretty good reaction time

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.129 
10 I have pretty good reaction time
myself<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.269> don't<00:03:18.450> really<00:03:18.540> need<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.870> higher

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
myself so I don't really need it higher

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.020 
myself so I don't really need it higher
and<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:20.040> makes<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.400> realistic<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and it makes it more realistic for the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390 
and it makes it more realistic for the
cpu<00:03:21.420> interceptions<00:03:22.350> 25<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.889> know<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.069> happens

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
cpu interceptions 25 you know it happens

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.900 
cpu interceptions 25 you know it happens
sometimes<00:03:23.819> pass<00:03:24.690> rushing<00:03:25.049> 25<00:03:25.829> 35<00:03:26.220> very

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
sometimes pass rushing 25 35 very

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.059 
sometimes pass rushing 25 35 very
important<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.569> have<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.930> mainly<00:03:28.709> because<00:03:28.739> of

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
important to have that mainly because of

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.690 
important to have that mainly because of
the<00:03:29.900> pass<00:03:30.900> blocking<00:03:31.260> they'll<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.920> 10<00:03:32.190> so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
the pass blocking they'll have is 10 so

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.430 
the pass blocking they'll have is 10 so
you'll<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.150> your<00:03:33.329> fair<00:03:33.600> share<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.930> four<00:03:34.350> or

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
you'll get your fair share of four or

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
you'll get your fair share of four or
five<00:03:34.470> sacks<00:03:34.889> per<00:03:35.100> game<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.670> pretty<00:03:35.910> much

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
five sacks per game that's pretty much

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.530 
five sacks per game that's pretty much
what<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.389> means<00:03:37.670> rush<00:03:38.670> defense<00:03:38.880> reaction<00:03:39.389> time

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
what it means rush defense reaction time

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.280 
what it means rush defense reaction time
40<00:03:39.930> block<00:03:40.440> shedding<00:03:40.769> zero<00:03:41.130> tackling<00:03:42.090> 35<00:03:42.510> this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
40 block shedding zero tackling 35 this

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.990 
40 block shedding zero tackling 35 this
one<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.680> really<00:03:44.040> important<00:03:44.549> because<00:03:44.670> they'll

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
one is really important because they'll

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.610 
one is really important because they'll
react<00:03:45.329> but<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.630> can't<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:46.019> away<00:03:46.260> from<00:03:46.319> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
react but they can't get away from the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.599 
react but they can't get away from the
offensive<00:03:47.040> lineman<00:03:47.400> who<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.660> at<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.920> 35<00:03:50.280> run

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
offensive lineman who is at a 35 run

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.849 
offensive lineman who is at a 35 run
blocking<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.780> means<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.230> they'll<00:03:52.680> get

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
blocking so that means that they'll get

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.140 
blocking so that means that they'll get
running<00:03:53.160> lanes<00:03:53.340> you'll<00:03:53.549> get<00:03:53.700> running<00:03:53.880> lanes

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
running lanes you'll get running lanes

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.940 
running lanes you'll get running lanes
and<00:03:54.389> if<00:03:54.600> you're<00:03:54.750> good<00:03:54.959> with<00:03:55.109> your<00:03:55.139> QB<00:03:55.680> you'll

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
and if you're good with your QB you'll

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.520 
and if you're good with your QB you'll
get<00:03:56.099> passing<00:03:56.549> options<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.000> well

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
get passing options as well

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.360 
get passing options as well
onto<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> QB<00:03:58.980> these<00:03:59.609> are<00:03:59.819> much<00:04:00.060> different<00:04:00.239> and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
onto the QB these are much different and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.699 
onto the QB these are much different and
I'll<00:04:02.370> pretty<00:04:02.639> much<00:04:02.700> explain<00:04:03.090> why<00:04:03.650> you'll<00:04:04.650> see

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
I'll pretty much explain why you'll see

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.750 
I'll pretty much explain why you'll see
in<00:04:05.010> my<00:04:05.160> next<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.989> connect<00:04:06.989> career<00:04:07.290> videos<00:04:07.980> that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
in my next to connect career videos that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.789 
in my next to connect career videos that
I<00:04:08.790> blew<00:04:09.359> out<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.630> two<00:04:09.780> teams<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.109> faced<00:04:10.349> one<00:04:10.769> of

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
I blew out the two teams I faced one of

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.650 
I blew out the two teams I faced one of
them<00:04:10.980> was<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.190> Saints<00:04:11.579> one<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.299> them<00:04:12.419> was<00:04:12.569> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
them was the Saints one of them was the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.190 
them was the Saints one of them was the
Rams<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.799> Saints<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.340> beat<00:04:14.549> 44:10<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.810> Rams<00:04:16.049> I

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
Rams the Saints I beat 44:10 the Rams I

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.140 
Rams the Saints I beat 44:10 the Rams I
beat<00:04:16.349> 51<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.489> 19<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:19.849> obviously<00:04:20.849> that's<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
beat 51 to 19 and obviously that's a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.170 
beat 51 to 19 and obviously that's a
little<00:04:21.770> unfair<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.010> say<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.880> least

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
little unfair to say the least

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.050 
little unfair to say the least
so<00:04:24.720> QB<00:04:25.349> accuracy<00:04:25.710> 25<00:04:26.130> raise<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.550> up

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
so QB accuracy 25 raise that up

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.629 
so QB accuracy 25 raise that up
pass<00:04:27.389> blocking<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:28.110> little<00:04:28.680> higher<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.130> YRC

ever catching a little lower mainly

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.210 
ever catching a little lower mainly
because<00:04:31.139> they<00:04:31.260> catch<00:04:31.470> almost<00:04:31.770> everything

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
because they catch almost everything

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.680 
because they catch almost everything
anyway

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.350

broken<00:04:34.530> tackles<00:04:34.860> 15<00:04:35.310> because<00:04:35.669> they<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:35.970> not

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
broken tackles 15 because they do not

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.420

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
get good running off of me

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.879 
get good running off of me
they<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:39.240> fumble<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.050> that's<00:04:40.620> not<00:04:40.740> really

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
they don't fumble so that's not really

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.640 
they don't fumble so that's not really

reaction<00:04:43.650> time<00:04:43.800> 15<00:04:44.250> because<00:04:44.730> they<00:04:45.300> do<00:04:45.360> seem<00:04:45.810> to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
reaction time 15 because they do seem to

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.629 
reaction time 15 because they do seem to
be<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.169> little<00:04:46.410> slow

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
be a little slow

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
rushing a little bit lower so it kind of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.270 
rushing a little bit lower so it kind of
balances<00:04:51.810> out<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.350> then<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.860> rush<00:04:53.040> defense

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
balances out and then the rush defense

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280 
balances out and then the rush defense
exactly<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> same<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:54.900> still<00:04:55.139> get<00:04:55.260> my
