another thing you could do is you about
the<00:04:08.100> running<00:04:08.340> back<00:04:08.750> put<00:04:09.750> these<00:04:09.870> guys<00:04:10.020> in<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
the running back put these guys in the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.960 
the running back put these guys in the
same<00:04:10.530> route<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:11.040> then<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.460> can<00:04:11.610> go<00:04:11.730> ahead<00:04:11.820> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
same route and then you can go ahead and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.420 
same route and then you can go ahead and
motion<00:04:12.360> him<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> outside<00:04:13.200> moshi<00:04:14.190> came

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430

motion him to the outside moshi came
back<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:16.140> hike<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.440> ball<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.580> then

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
back in and then hike the ball and then

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.160 
back in and then hike the ball and then
get<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> speed<00:04:18.239> burst<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:18.840> he<00:04:18.900> gets<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
get a speed burst and then he gets a

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.050 
get a speed burst and then he gets a
catch<00:04:19.380> well<00:04:19.859> that's<00:04:20.190> what<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.489> want<00:04:20.700> that's<00:04:21.000> a

catch well that's what we want that's a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.460 
catch well that's what we want that's a
little<00:04:21.180> speed<00:04:21.540> burst<00:04:21.720> thing<00:04:21.900> he<00:04:21.989> goes<00:04:22.170> out<00:04:22.320> to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
little speed burst thing he goes out to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
little speed burst thing he goes out to
the<00:04:22.560> outside<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.920> could<00:04:23.040> do<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.460> well

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the outside you could do that as well

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.550 
the outside you could do that as well
with<00:04:23.760> him<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.570> again<00:04:25.080> we're<00:04:25.230> gonna<00:04:25.350> go<00:04:25.500> ahead

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.780 
with him so again we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:25.680> motion<00:04:25.980> here<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.310> outside<00:04:28.790> motion

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
and motion here to the outside motion

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.560 
and motion here to the outside motion
him<00:04:29.910> back<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.830> then<00:04:31.830> get<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.010> street<00:04:32.310> person

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
him back in then get a street person

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.030 
him back in then get a street person
 I<00:04:33.600> threw<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.200> wrong<00:04:34.380> guy<00:04:34.440> all

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
 I threw it to the wrong guy all

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.470 
 I threw it to the wrong guy all
right<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.700> you<00:04:35.760> want<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.030> get<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.210> speed

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
right so you want to get that speed

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.850 
right so you want to get that speed
burst<00:04:36.690> practice<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:37.260> sweeper<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
burst practice that sweeper to the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.680 
burst practice that sweeper to the
running<00:04:38.010> back<00:04:38.130> for<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.520> timing<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.180> don't

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
running back for the timing I don't

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.240 
running back for the timing I don't
think<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.110> best<00:04:40.380> place<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.890> throw<00:04:40.920> it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
think this is the best place to throw it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.470 
think this is the best place to throw it
a<00:04:41.340> thing<00:04:41.520> with<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.670> little<00:04:41.880> bit<00:04:42.030> more<00:04:42.180> field

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
a thing with a little bit more field

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.990 
a thing with a little bit more field
will<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> lot<00:04:43.740> better<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.870> right<00:04:46.080> here

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
will be a lot better so right here

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.170 
will be a lot better so right here
watching<00:04:48.000> him<00:04:48.150> back<00:04:48.360> right<00:04:49.370> there<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:51.000> then

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
watching him back right there and then

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.030 
watching him back right there and then
look<00:04:51.390> at<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:51.870> had<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.290> nice<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.770> nice

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
look at that now we had the nice a nice

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.980 
look at that now we had the nice a nice
game<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.760> got<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:53.910> see<00:04:54.240> there<00:04:54.420> so<00:04:54.630> he<00:04:54.750> gets<00:04:54.930> a

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
game you got to see there so he gets a

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.100 
game you got to see there so he gets a
lot<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.170> separation<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.340> little<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:57.110> little

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
lot of separation with a little a little

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.140 
lot of separation with a little a little
steps<00:04:58.950> today<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.340> say<00:04:59.460> half<00:04:59.670> a<00:04:59.760> step<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
steps today and say half a step to the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.390 
steps today and say half a step to the
inside<00:05:00.920> moving<00:05:01.920> month<00:05:02.250> again<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:04.190> was<00:05:05.190> yet<00:05:05.370> to

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
inside moving month again I was yet to

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.150 
inside moving month again I was yet to
see<00:05:05.700> that<00:05:05.730> with<00:05:05.970> quite<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.300> motion<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.840> guy

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
see that with quite a motion this guy

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.600 
see that with quite a motion this guy
take<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> habit<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.820> right<00:05:09.300> there<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:11.430> then

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
take it a habit it right there and then

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.370 
take it a habit it right there and then
he's<00:05:11.820> gonna<00:05:11.970> get<00:05:12.180> not<00:05:12.480> this<00:05:12.630> time<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.900> didn't<00:05:13.260> do

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
he's gonna get not this time I didn't do

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.890 
he's gonna get not this time I didn't do
it<00:05:13.530> throw<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.130> tip<00:05:14.550> too<00:05:14.700> long<00:05:14.880> but<00:05:15.150> anyways

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
it throw the tip too long but anyways

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.560 
it throw the tip too long but anyways
that's<00:05:16.200> how<00:05:16.410> we<00:05:17.040> set<00:05:17.250> up<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.430> plate<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:18.390> want

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
that's how we set up this plate you want

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.970 
that's how we set up this plate you want
to<00:05:18.660> make<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> more<00:05:19.050> glitchy<00:05:19.380> go<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:19.770> game

to do this that's the reason I got

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.220 
to do this that's the reason I got
Russell<00:05:26.490> Wilson<00:05:26.790> here<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.300> outside<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.200> we

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
Russell Wilson here on the outside so we

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.520 
Russell Wilson here on the outside so we
can<00:05:28.380> go<00:05:28.560> ahead<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:29.340> roster<00:05:29.790> operate<00:05:30.530> and

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
can go ahead and a roster operate and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.110 
can go ahead and a roster operate and
then<00:05:31.710> we<00:05:31.830> get<00:05:31.950> Matthews<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.580> we<00:05:32.669> line<00:05:32.850> them<00:05:32.970> up

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
then we get Matthews and we line them up

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.270 
then we get Matthews and we line them up
and<00:05:33.750> stack<00:05:34.080> them<00:05:34.230> up<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.620> let<00:05:34.830> me<00:05:34.950> see

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
and stack them up and let me see

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.730 
and stack them up and let me see
now<00:05:35.940> we<00:05:36.000> could<00:05:36.210> also<00:05:36.330> do<00:05:36.570> this<00:05:36.750> where<00:05:37.440> we<00:05:37.560> could

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
now we could also do this where we could

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.560 
now we could also do this where we could
do<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:37.980> double<00:05:38.340> motion<00:05:38.670> with<00:05:38.850> motion<00:05:39.210> Matthews

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
do a double motion with motion Matthews

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.230 
do a double motion with motion Matthews
right<00:05:40.320> there<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.520> then<00:05:41.639> we<00:05:41.760> could<00:05:41.910> motion

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
right there and then we could motion

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.720 
right there and then we could motion
this<00:05:42.389> guy<00:05:42.570> so<00:05:42.840> that's<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.170> double<00:05:43.380> motion<00:05:43.919> okay

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
this guy so that's a double motion okay

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.460 
this guy so that's a double motion okay
so<00:05:44.790> now<00:05:45.090> we<00:05:45.150> have<00:05:45.240> double<00:05:45.660> motion<00:05:46.050> right<00:05:46.169> here

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.070 
so now we have double motion right here
and<00:05:46.650> then<00:05:47.310> we<00:05:47.790> could<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.120> do<00:05:48.419> the<00:05:48.540> same<00:05:48.570> setup

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
and then we could just do the same setup

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.120 
and then we could just do the same setup
right<00:05:49.320> here<00:05:49.380> and<00:05:50.780> it's<00:05:51.780> wait<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.680> guys<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:52.980> see
