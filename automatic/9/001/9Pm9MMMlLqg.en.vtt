just going to take manifold people think

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.390 
just going to take manifold people think
that<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> gives<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.650> horsepower<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that it gives you more horsepower but it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.950 
that it gives you more horsepower but it
just<00:01:14.549> allows<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> use<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.150> horsepower

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just allows you to use your horsepower

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
just allows you to use your horsepower
better<00:01:18.500> don't<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> spin
