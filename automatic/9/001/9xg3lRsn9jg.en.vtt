00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Prayer for high priests 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 1. Come, Father, my hour, glorify me, that I may glorify you, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 that through my power, I might give life to those whom, Father, you gave me. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 2. Your name, Father, I have revealed to them, it is Your children whom You gave me. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And they believe in all your words, I pray for them, that you may guard them. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 3. The world is their enemy because they do not know You, as you sent me, I send them. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Sanctify them in truth, your word is truth, I sacrifice myself for them in sacrifice. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 4. Let them be one, as we are, I am in You and Father in You. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That the world may know that You sent me, that You love them, how You love me. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 5. I also want, Father, whom You have given me, take with me to Your glory. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Let them see how much you love me, that our happiness may dwell in them. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Come, Father, my hour, glorify me, that I may glorify you. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 That I may give you life for ever, to those whom, Father, you gave me.
