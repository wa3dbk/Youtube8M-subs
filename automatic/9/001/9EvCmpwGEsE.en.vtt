grille sort of sticks out and then there

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.850 
grille sort of sticks out and then there
was<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> VG<00:02:29.330> which<00:02:29.600> has<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> flatter<00:02:30.380> front

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
was the VG which has a flatter front

was the VG which has a flatter front
rectangular<00:02:31.520> headlights<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:33.290> also<00:02:33.530> at<00:02:33.890> this

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
rectangular headlights now also at this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.190 
rectangular headlights now also at this
show<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.520> another<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:35.060> sort<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.780> based<00:02:36.020> on

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
show was another one sort of based on

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.960 
show was another one sort of based on
the<00:02:36.290> VG<00:02:37.450> valiant<00:02:38.450> was<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.350> now<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.160> think<00:02:40.850> it's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
the VG valiant was this now I think it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.310 
the VG valiant was this now I think it's
not<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> valiant<00:02:41.540> technically<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.260> a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
not a valiant technically it's a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.770 
not a valiant technically it's a
Chrysler<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.070> VIP<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.940> slightly

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
Chrysler but it's a VIP like a slightly

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.710 
Chrysler but it's a VIP like a slightly
longer<00:02:45.050> wheelbase<00:02:46.000> before<00:02:47.000> ours<00:02:47.210> are<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
longer wheelbase before ours are a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.090 
maybe and I think at the show that was
it<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:53.990> that<00:02:54.140> was<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.650> was<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.830> at<00:02:55.010> the
