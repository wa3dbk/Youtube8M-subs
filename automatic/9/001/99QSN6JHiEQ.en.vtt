00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.220
 The Netherlands has moved from Taiwan to Tokyo 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.160
 and then it is played in this 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.080
 beautiful stadium good for 55,000 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.940

 inning it state 0 0 this is curt smith 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.260
 important man 2 years ago then 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.090
 Netherlands became world champion 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.189
 because then it was most valuable 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
 player and now it is very valuable 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 because he is a homebrew 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 a 0 for the Netherlands and summing kurt 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.910
 smit and the netherlands a bit 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.940
 an a 'looked for for cuba 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 orange won twice during the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 world championships two years ago 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.800
 but also just before this tournament was there 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 a practice match run through the Netherlands 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.170
 was won with five zero 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.379
 the best pitcher for cuba on the hill 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.989
 kalian sams the batter ball in one go 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.030
 against the wall and he reaches the second 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.550
 base 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 still in the second kalian inning 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.680
 sams good baseball player the left clear 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.380
 from hensley meulens and his orange de 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.090
 manager and this is the third base coach 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.090
 are requirements that the signs gives 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.189
 Ricardo attack and that must hit town 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 putting it in you does well in this way 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.310
 sometimes getting to third base is self 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 out at first base 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.830
 but a man and third base property 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.830
 for orange 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.810
 great baseball player and dordt and simmons 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 player in the major league at spring 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 and he does what is asked of him 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.210
 being unoccupied with the third he stands one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.210
 single and the Netherlands suffers with 2 0 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.900
 elated 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.260
 the rotten wall we go a surprise 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.260
 to get 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.370
 Cuba is called the strong batting team 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.770
 and then this d'espagne alfredo also appears 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.450
 d'espagne immediately hits a higher one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.600
 tying second inning 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.160
 also a solo other two a but jack 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.680
 and Mark did not be fooled 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.440
 Bring threw an excellent game 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.300
 the throw of by neptune and when you get in 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.520
 the problems came 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.080
 then there were double play this is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.430
 a ball where 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.930
 midfielder bernardine the ball has it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.120
 fact is and simmons grab the ball very quickly 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.190
 on and the man on first base 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.380
 are also thrown out and doubles one 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.790
 out of five double play in this 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.340
 contest 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 simmons grab the ball for bernardina and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 throws him to first base very quickly 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.489
 to short smith and the man to there 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.020
 back there was 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.620
 so choose from and that was important 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.090
 for this jaguar mark again 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.190
 first unoccupied 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 low ball towards school scope 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.750
 siemens siemens 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.610
 turns the double play towards short run 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.660
 and how nice it is if your field is like that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.150
 well still plays a two possession in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.620
 the fourth inning and again a home 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.320
 busy 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.739
 simmons scope smith and another one 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.739
 doubles 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.170
 excellent work of defense 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.730
 like an orange already plays well in 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.830
 this tournament 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.650
 but now also attacking the one to the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.280
 another bang 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.280
 weather kalian sams 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:29.220
 with a double we are then in the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:35.280
 sixth inning and 4 know 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:38.430
 with two men out for simmons mesa 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.290
 see the trainer coach manager of cuba 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.400
 the mood already because John shot it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.650
 a scope 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.980
 what a swipe two higher in 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.440
 this tournament and the jones delight everyone 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.810
 happy for a 3-point homer and means 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.570
 5 one for orange 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 mesa determines our plug and bolt 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.220
 very man who is at the baltimore orioles 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.530
 is paid and not yet at the highest 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.830
 level but how long can that expensive 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.100
 therefore hits a 3-point higher 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.970
 Cuba can give something back very well 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.060
 throwing 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.440
 Jaguar Mark did ball back to the short 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.730
 stop them simmons with the first 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.730
 converted and again a double play 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.590
 yes and then hensley meulens can be the manager 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.090
 and robert unicorn the bands coach and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 of course , keeping alive was the pitch 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.220
 coach that we saw standing in the middle 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.169
 be satisfied with the market 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.650
 the netherlands continues here a whole lot 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.169
 hard single by simmons that so hard 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.450
 is that he didn't reach second base 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.610
 normally that is a double now 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.800
 a single folder but it says enough 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.690
 about this orange 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.580
 john it a shock than the big man of 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.950
 the match had two counts in there 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.410
 the higher and now a bang past the third 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.390
 base and simmons can walk 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.490
 you can walk very fast and come from it 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.229
 first dog to the home plate 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.229
 and scores 6 2 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.819
 john it a school 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.039
 21 years a huge talent in it 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.370
 Dutch baseball team and then we are 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.370
 in the final phase 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.780
 You must also be lucky in that 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.840
 the baseball 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.310
 tall building behind and curt smith can there 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.699
 just not with 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.539
 ball disappears with the photographers but he 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.669
 is smart 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.770
 the path very quickly the bubble this 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.169
 glove and the referee's mark 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.669
 and highly appreciated referee 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.039
 did not see it and gives the man 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.310
 off and then it is clearly the Netherlands 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.259
 is going to win cuba with 6 2 he does 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.840
 a very good step forward 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:46.940
 towards the final group in san francisco 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.940
 6 2 win from cuba to that point
