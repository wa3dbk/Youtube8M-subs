00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.970
 the following heating up a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.830
 m 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.450
 and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.560
 cholera 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.840
 Y 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.039
 good good we started the change of 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.320
 place because I want a little more of 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.030
 power after the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.770
 do if I want to laugh more the first thing 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.650
 what I'm going to put is a little bit of oil 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.180
 the pan pan with a thick bottom is 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 thicker you have to distribute well 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.870
 the temperature that contains everything well and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:52.120
 inside that does not hold as much as 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.059
 when I'm going to put you here directly 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 the minced meat that limestone beef 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 vaccine 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.799
 moved this 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.289
 this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.039
 sr choose the technique you want to help 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.039
 to open it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.700
 or rather 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.550
 Mix the meat a bit with wine 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 so that it does not stick so it starts 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:30.140
 to separate and you do not have to separate the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:33.740
 meat and olive oil a little bit of 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.660
 olive oil there very important less 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.190
 important exactly greater either the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.200
 pavada that has a little bit of fat 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.000
 the minced meat but we need that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 have a little more usually do all 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.210
 together, this is a beautiful one, 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 say it in a quick way 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.290
 aha as soon as I see that also a little the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:56.530
 color of all this with a little bit of 20 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.530
 minutes 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.270
 there is more already with this is little bit so 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.850
 a huge difference of flavor in 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 here gave me some fat to follow 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 taking and the time releasing there 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.890
 Sometimes you have if I keep a little price 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.540
 in some corner of the fridge this 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.910
 of smoked bacon this nothing or almost 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.820
 company this without the TV if you stay a 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.070
 It costs you there you give a couple of 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.460
 returns and Cáceres with a rich fund of 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.140
 taste when I feel this took color or 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.700
 better dictated that it changed its color not 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.920
 I want to give much either but 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.090
 simply that you start cooking what 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.660
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.600
 to put onion and morrón in this case 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.610
 morrón green to generate a rich 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.740
 pretty then they're going by 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.810
 whole phenomenon something like that I already have it 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.230
 cut and touch a good big onion 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.180
 chopped in here I do not want 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.189
 add a lot 6 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.710
 a little mold that could break 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.930
 do it about people 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.150
 before he starts releasing his ulna 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.940
 torrico is one of the many ways of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 make a poland we are going to put more 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.360
 ingredients we are going to put a little 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 more flavor but that in a little while for 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.610
 stay behind the book 9 I think
