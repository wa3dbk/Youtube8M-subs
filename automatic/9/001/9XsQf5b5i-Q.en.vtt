00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 shareholders the new shareholders do not 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.120
 have any rights over the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.790
 assets of the bank of italy 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.670
 therefore from this point of view the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 gold reserves owned by the bank 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 of Italy in support of the system 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.470
 European Monetary Fund are safeguarded 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 because none of the new shareholders will have 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.449
 will have rights are entitled only to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 share quotas but no intervention 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.790
 assets in this these are the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.190
 reasons for which the order lies 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
 of the day was considered by us 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.879
 not acceptable 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.850
 because upstream and solved the problem 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.770
 through a first European regulation and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 then the safeguard that this 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.200
 provision does even improving 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 the previous situation that is that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 still in effect until we try it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 for which instead the same shareholders 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.100
 bank of italy some rights 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.559
 they would have it on fate on the side 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.309
 that is excluded 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.799
 with that provision in question 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.600
 thanks undersecretary I asked to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.600
 speak the deputy melons please 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090
 yes thank you president would come to say 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.420
 after the intervention of the undersecretary 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 baretto baretto is sum that was better 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.869
 before 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 better not know what the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.100
 Government motivation with respect to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.890
 contrary opinion to this order of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 day I sincerely connect you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 I ask for a moment of attention on this 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.000
 question because inside that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.460
 that is being consumed in this classroom that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.490
 it is already a robbery, an act is consummated 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.420
 even more serious very quickly 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.640
 italy is the third nation in the world for 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 consistency of gold reserves 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.710
 we have about 2,500 tons 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:10.370
 of gold amounting to approximately 110 billion euros 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.010
 which are the only guarantee 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:17.849
 it is the only wealth, though relative 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.739
 left to the Italians and they are also one 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.739
 of the very few guarantees that we 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.720
 we have to protect our autonomy 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.270
 and independence 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.520
 because the problem that the decree poses 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.459
 on the bank of italy is not just the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.739
 problem related to giving away billions of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.170
 euro to the banks we are used to 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.340
 the problem that the decree places on the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 bank of italy is that we are 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.640
 expropriating the Italian people and the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.459
 we are expropriating its sovereignty 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.030
 monetary policy and its sovereignty 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.920
 national 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.739
 then why we presented 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.440
 this agenda which was second 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.659
 me a banal agenda that 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.420
 it was simply a point 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.140
 and to have a certainty what it says 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.540
 this banal agenda says that 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.680
 the risks of what is important 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.050
 clarify specify if we want one 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.050
 which everyone knows and that is that 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.110
 independently of the change we say 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.920
 of the capital of the bankitalia of the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.970
 possession of bankitalia's capital 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.410
 and the times that these gold reserves 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.790
 remain the property of the people 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.130
 Italian 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.569
 this says the agenda on 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.290
 which the government has given an opinion 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.380
 otherwise he says we can put black on 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.959
 white that these gold reserves ie 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.150
 this gold that is the fruit of the sweat of the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.970
 Italians remain the property of the people 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.970
 Italian you can put black on white 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.010
 something so trivial and one can already believe that 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.319
 we are asking for the return of that part 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.239
 of our gold bars for 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.610
 meaning that they should be detained 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.459
 take them outside national borders 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.200
 within national borders 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.380
 undersecretary baretta does not respond to 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.370
 this banal question tells us of course that 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.980
 it is so 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.220
 and the question comes spontaneously 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.620
 undersecretary if so what is the obstacle 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.959
 write it if it is because you from a 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.979
 contrary opinion on a trivial thing that 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.340
 we all know 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.200
 we will make a superficial underline 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.080
 but for some it could be 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.910
 important otherwise she understands that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.850
 the fact of not wanting to put black on 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.410
 white something so trivial leaves 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.720
 to think that things are not 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.180
 exactly how you go about saying e 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.460
 that is , your second step afterwards 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.470
 having revalued the shares of the capital of 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.900
 bankitalia which means spending the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.630
 our central bank is also giving away 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.970
 getting your banker friends friends 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.520
 of the government also of the bank 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.430
 of Italy also the gold of the Italians and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.310
 this would be the last act of 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.200
 betrayal of this parliament in the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.200
 against the Italians then one thing 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.990
 trivial colleagues as I think we are 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.289
 all agree that gold that 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.060
 cus kept in the basements of the 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.550
 bank of italy and not only is owned 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.520
 of the Italians you can politely 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.220
 vote on this agenda so that 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.780
 we do something trivial but there 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.139
 shelters from the accusation of high 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.820
 betrayal that is to say that the gold that 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.770
 is in the gases in the 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.590
 subscale of the bank of italy and not 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.960
 it is the sole property of the Italians 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.240
 no case can be touched by these 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.930
 new owners of our bank 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.020
 central 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.280
 thanks thanks honorable melons and writings 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.280
 to speak the honorable the Russian 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.210
 thank you president 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.930
 see the colleagues who preceded me 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.810
 the Italian brothers stressed 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.950
 presented a single agenda 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.980
 because sometimes you don't need to 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.770
 stress the classroom to overdo it or not 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.410
 exaggerate with obstructionism 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.030
 sometimes just put your finger on 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.490
 plague and I do not envy the poor 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.660
 undersecretary baretta who orphaned of the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.330
 minister 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.210
 orphan of the president of the council 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.440
 orphan of the other undersecretaries of the 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.410
 his department 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.410
 it must also be a good person
