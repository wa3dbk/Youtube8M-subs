00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
makes for a pretty nice and steady

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.360 
makes for a pretty nice and steady
experience<00:00:39.270> rate<00:00:39.540> even<00:00:40.500> though<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.010> monsters

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
experience rate even though the monsters

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.279 
experience rate even though the monsters
are<00:00:41.520> relatively<00:00:42.000> weak<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.899> amount<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
are relatively weak the amount of

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.770 
are relatively weak the amount of
monsters<00:00:43.500> makes<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.690> there<00:00:45.690> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
monsters makes up for that there are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
monsters makes up for that there are

is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> biggest<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.230> most<00:00:49.260> common<00:00:49.769> place<00:00:51.199> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
is the biggest and most common place to

basically<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:57.480> types<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> pirates

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
basically there's four types of pirates

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
basically there's four types of pirates
Marauders<00:00:59.670> which<00:01:00.089> are<00:01:00.300> comparable<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
Marauders which are comparable to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.649 
Marauders which are comparable to
Cyclops<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.339> have<00:01:02.670> some<00:01:02.909> minor<00:01:03.149> distance

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
Cyclops they do have some minor distance

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.479 
Cyclops they do have some minor distance
attack<00:01:03.960> though<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.769> nothing<00:01:05.190> that<00:01:05.220> should

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
attack though but nothing that should

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.070 
attack though but nothing that should
kill<00:01:05.730> you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
kill you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.960 
kill you
then<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.320> cutthroats<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:08.820> bit

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
then there's cutthroats they have a bit

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
then there's cutthroats they have a bit
of<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> stronger<00:01:09.720> distance<00:01:10.140> attack<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.890> hit<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
of a stronger distance attack they hit a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
of a stronger distance attack they hit a
bit<00:01:11.310> harder<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.760> melee<00:01:12.030> range<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.540> they

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
bit harder in melee range and they

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.319 
bit harder in melee range and they
poison<00:01:13.560> which<00:01:14.189> only<00:01:14.490> takes<00:01:14.700> four<00:01:14.880> five<00:01:15.060> times

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
poison which only takes four five times

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.660 
poison which only takes four five times
so<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.110> annoying<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so it's just annoying and not really

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.050 
so it's just annoying and not really
worth<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> antidote<00:01:18.810> spell<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
worth using the antidote spell for the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
worth using the antidote spell for the
third<00:01:21.329> type<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> pirates<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> Buccaneers

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
they are pretty strong and hit a bit

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.490

harder<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> both<00:01:25.619> melee<00:01:26.189> ends<00:01:26.640> ranged<00:01:27.030> attacks

sometimes cause a musical beam which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
sometimes cause a musical beam which
