00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
at Orlando International and the first

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.630 
at Orlando International and the first
thing<00:00:14.690> I'm<00:00:14.810> going<00:00:14.840> to<00:00:14.960> want<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.170> do<00:00:15.320> or<00:00:15.530> you<00:00:15.640> if

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
you want to access the GPS somehow you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.249 
you want to access the GPS somehow you
could<00:00:19.760> do<00:00:19.880> that<00:00:20.060> via<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.599> regular<00:00:21.529> cockpit<00:00:22.130> by

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
could do that via the regular cockpit by

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.499 
could do that via the regular cockpit by
pressing<00:00:24.259> that<00:00:24.439> button<00:00:24.499> right<00:00:24.859> there<00:00:25.480> so<00:00:26.480> you

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
pressing that button right there so you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.229 
pressing that button right there so you
would<00:00:26.720> do<00:00:26.869> that<00:00:27.310> okay<00:00:28.310> then<00:00:28.519> you<00:00:28.579> simply<00:00:28.939> go<00:00:29.179> to

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
would do that okay then you simply go to

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.450 
would do that okay then you simply go to
this<00:00:29.569> arrow<00:00:30.169> thing<00:00:30.710> right<00:00:30.890> here<00:00:31.069> with<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.249> D

this arrow thing right here with the D

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.799 
this arrow thing right here with the D
on<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:33.070> then<00:00:34.070> you're<00:00:34.489> here<00:00:34.850> now<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:35.510> want

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
now showed up on your GPS right now 69

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.600 
now showed up on your GPS right now 69
nautical<00:01:26.240> miles<00:01:26.420> away<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.430> then

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
nautical miles away and you can then

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.210 
nautical miles away and you can then
navigate<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.480> airport<00:01:30.050> once<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.680> take

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
navigate to the airport once you take

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.120 
navigate to the airport once you take
off<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:34.040> now<00:01:34.190> just<00:01:34.490> pulling<00:01:34.730> up

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
off so now just pulling up

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.730 
off so now just pulling up
and

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.640 

so<00:01:39.340> here<00:01:39.670> we<00:01:39.729> go<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.880> took<00:01:40.150> off<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:41.560> is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
so here we go I took off and so this is

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.149 
so here we go I took off and so this is
how<00:01:41.740> you're<00:01:42.280> going<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.549> activate<00:01:43.510> your

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
how you're going to activate your

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.960 
how you're going to activate your
navigation<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.810> temple<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.020> case<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
navigation to temple in this case so

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.420 
navigation to temple in this case so
I'll<00:01:49.150> engage<00:01:49.600> autopilot<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:53.430> altitude

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
I'll engage autopilot like that altitude

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.469 
I'll engage autopilot like that altitude
hold<00:01:55.200> set<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> little<00:01:56.680> higher<00:01:57.119> than<00:01:58.119> my

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
hold set that a little higher than my

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.499 
hold set that a little higher than my
throttle<00:01:59.280> okay<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.340> now<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:00.909> is<00:02:00.970> where<00:02:01.300> you

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
throttle okay so now this is where you

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.600 
throttle okay so now this is where you
set<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.610> navigation<00:02:04.320> tool<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:06.580> can

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
set the navigation tool so you you can

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.910 
set the navigation tool so you you can
do<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.090> virtual<00:02:07.509> cockpit<00:02:07.720> too<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:08.590> it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
do it in virtual cockpit too but it's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.600 
do it in virtual cockpit too but it's
easier<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> go<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> cockpit<00:02:10.110> okay<00:02:11.110> go<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.950> this

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
easier to go to cockpit okay go to this

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.360 
easier to go to cockpit okay go to this
thing<00:02:12.850> where<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.090> says<00:02:13.239> Navin<00:02:13.720> GPS<00:02:14.370> okay

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
thing where it says Navin GPS okay

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.410 
thing where it says Navin GPS okay
