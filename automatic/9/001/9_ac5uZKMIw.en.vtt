four dollars and ninety-five cents not
be<00:00:38.839> able<00:00:38.899> to<00:00:39.019> look<00:00:39.079> at<00:00:39.199> here<00:00:39.379> we<00:00:39.530> can<00:00:39.679> see<00:00:39.920> what

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
be able to look at here we can see what

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.229 
be able to look at here we can see what
the<00:00:40.999> case<00:00:41.210> comprises<00:00:42.019> of<00:00:42.670> very<00:00:43.670> easy<00:00:43.909> to<00:00:44.120> open

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the case comprises of very easy to open

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.180 
the case comprises of very easy to open
packaging<00:00:44.899> they're<00:00:45.079> much<00:00:45.530> easier<00:00:45.559> than<00:00:46.069> i

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
packaging they're much easier than i

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.809 
packaging they're much easier than i
remember<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.670> iphone<00:00:47.059> 4<00:00:47.359> 1<00:00:47.539> be<00:00:48.429> inside<00:00:49.429> here

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:49.819 
remember the iphone 4 1 be inside here

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.549 
remember the iphone 4 1 be inside here
we<00:00:50.030> have<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:51.370> microfiber<00:00:52.370> cloth<00:00:53.019> nice<00:00:54.019> white<00:00:54.350> 1

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
we have a microfiber cloth nice white 1

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.599 
we have a microfiber cloth nice white 1
i'm<00:00:54.679> sure<00:00:54.859> that's<00:00:55.069> not<00:00:55.190> going<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.429> take<00:00:55.579> any

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
i'm sure that's not going to take any

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.149 
i'm sure that's not going to take any
time<00:00:55.999> it's<00:00:56.179> all<00:00:56.300> taking<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.539> dirty<00:00:56.749> a<00:00:57.050> tiny<00:00:57.800> card

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
time it's all taking a dirty a tiny card

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.700 
time it's all taking a dirty a tiny card
and<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:59.539> screen<00:00:59.809> protector<00:01:00.260> which<00:01:00.409> i'm<00:01:00.559> not

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
and the screen protector which i'm not

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.799 
and the screen protector which i'm not
going<00:01:00.889> to<00:01:00.949> bother<00:01:01.069> replying<00:01:01.579> because<00:01:02.089> if<00:01:02.659> I

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
going to bother replying because if I

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.140 
going to bother replying because if I
did<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.170> with<00:01:03.319> every<00:01:03.620> case<00:01:03.859> then<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.580> would

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
did that with every case then I would

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.870 
did that with every case then I would
have<00:01:05.180> quadrupled<00:01:05.960> glazing<00:01:06.560> I'm<00:01:06.740> sure<00:01:06.979> screen

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
have quadrupled glazing I'm sure screen

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.510 
have quadrupled glazing I'm sure screen
protectors<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:09.530> comes<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:10.040> two<00:01:10.280> parts

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
protectors now this comes in two parts

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.930 
protectors now this comes in two parts
essentially<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.210> get<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.510> rubbery<00:01:12.230> stiff

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
essentially you get this rubbery stiff

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.400 
essentially you get this rubbery stiff
silicon<00:01:13.940> like<00:01:14.150> frame<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:14.930> very<00:01:15.170> very

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
silicon like frame which is very very

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.740 
silicon like frame which is very very
durable<00:01:15.800> it's<00:01:16.190> got<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> good<00:01:16.640> good<00:01:17.420> amount<00:01:17.690> of

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
durable it's got a good good amount of

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.100 
durable it's got a good good amount of
stiffness<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:20.150> simply<00:01:20.690> places

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
stiffness to it and this simply places

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.610 
stiffness to it and this simply places
in<00:01:21.260> very<00:01:21.470> easily<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:22.690> there<00:01:23.690> like<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.290> now<00:01:24.560> if

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
in very easily in there like so now if

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.320 
in very easily in there like so now if
you<00:01:24.800> look<00:01:24.920> inside<00:01:25.130> if<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.670> actually<00:01:25.880> look<00:01:26.090> at

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
you look inside if you actually look at

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.150 
you look inside if you actually look at
the<00:01:26.480> panel<00:01:26.810> you'll<00:01:26.990> notice<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.710> very<00:01:27.920> is

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
the panel you'll notice it's a very is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.780 
the panel you'll notice it's a very is
quite<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> thick<00:01:28.820> material<00:01:29.540> it's<00:01:30.080> got<00:01:30.260> a<00:01:30.290> very

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
quite a thick material it's got a very

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.820 
quite a thick material it's got a very
protective<00:01:31.790> insides<00:01:32.720> covered<00:01:33.500> obviously

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
protective insides covered obviously

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.980 
protective insides covered obviously
with<00:01:33.980> this<00:01:34.130> fabric<00:01:34.580> on<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.820> inside<00:01:35.540> part

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
with this fabric on the inside part

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.930 
with this fabric on the inside part
which<00:01:36.560> actually<00:01:36.830> comes<00:01:37.130> into<00:01:37.430> contact<00:01:37.670> with

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
which actually comes into contact with

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.650 
which actually comes into contact with
your<00:01:38.120> phone<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:39.200> will<00:01:39.380> get<00:01:40.630> like<00:01:41.630> a

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
your phone you will get like a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
your phone you will get like a
microfiber<00:01:42.380> lining<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.370> outside<00:01:43.520> is

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
microfiber lining and on the outside is

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.230 
microfiber lining and on the outside is
a<00:01:44.030> much<00:01:44.270> more<00:01:44.570> durable<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.290> tougher<00:01:45.680> fabric

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
a much more durable a tougher fabric

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.120 
a much more durable a tougher fabric
it's<00:01:47.240> not<00:01:47.450> waterproof<00:01:47.930> but<00:01:48.530> i'm<00:01:48.770> pretty<00:01:48.980> sure

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
it's not waterproof but i'm pretty sure

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.120 
it's not waterproof but i'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:50.780> not<00:01:51.410> going<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.650> let<00:01:51.800> too<00:01:51.980> much

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's it's not going to let too much

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.560 
it's it's not going to let too much
water<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.670> through<00:01:52.820> though<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.150> feels<00:01:53.300> like

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
water in through though it feels like

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.080 
water in through though it feels like
kind<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.900> shower<00:01:54.170> proof<00:01:54.500> material<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.970> then

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
kind of shower proof material and then

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.910 
kind of shower proof material and then
