new boss is a robot but did you know
robots<00:03:49.519> are<00:03:49.790> smarter<00:03:50.180> than<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.480> robots<00:03:51.230> work

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
robots are smarter than you robots work

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.170 
robots are smarter than you robots work
harder<00:03:51.769> than<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.340> robots<00:03:52.790> are<00:03:52.970> better

than<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.860> volunteer<00:03:54.860> for<00:03:55.099> testing<00:03:55.519> today<00:03:55.700> I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
than you volunteer for testing today I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.650 
than you volunteer for testing today I
could<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.650> hear<00:03:58.220> Cave<00:03:58.670> Johnson<00:03:58.700> now<00:03:59.360> like

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
could just hear Cave Johnson now like

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.190 
could just hear Cave Johnson now like
come<00:03:59.870> on<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.980> know<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.190> want<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.549> do<00:04:02.000> vitals

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:14.380 

it's<00:04:06.200> okay<00:04:11.200> it's<00:04:12.200> okay<00:04:12.319> GLaDOS<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.209> burns<00:04:14.209> are

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
it's okay it's okay GLaDOS it burns are

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.780 
it's okay it's okay GLaDOS it burns are
not<00:04:14.510> gonna<00:04:14.660> hurt<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.959> anymore<00:04:17.109> okay<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.169> I

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
not gonna hurt you anymore okay so I

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.990 
not gonna hurt you anymore okay so I
gotta<00:04:19.790> make<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.000> there

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.170 

let's<00:04:24.000> try<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.330> safe<00:04:24.630> route<00:04:24.900> first<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:27.000> we'll

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
let's try the safe route first and we'll

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.690 
let's try the safe route first and we'll
work<00:04:27.450> all<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.780> way<00:04:27.810> up<00:04:28.050> here<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:29.010> yeah<00:04:29.460> there

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
work all the way up here and yeah there

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:44.030 
work all the way up here and yeah there
we<00:04:29.790> are<00:04:34.790> crap<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:38.000> knew<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.150> was<00:04:39.270> too<00:04:39.420> easy

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.400 

no<00:04:44.430> can't<00:04:44.790> make<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.030> there<00:04:45.210> either

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.390 

over<00:04:50.100> here<00:04:50.340> No

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.190 

so<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.430> assume<00:04:55.580> since<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.270> have<00:04:56.420> another<00:04:56.660> angled

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
so I assume since we have another angled

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.800 
so I assume since we have another angled
platform<00:04:57.740> we<00:04:58.040> have<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.430> somehow<00:04:58.670> get<00:04:59.660> our

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
platform we have to somehow get our

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.940 
platform we have to somehow get our
momentum<00:05:00.110> up<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:01.340> make<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.670> to<00:05:01.820> these<00:05:02.000> stairs<00:05:02.360> I

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
momentum up to make it to these stairs I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.990 
momentum up to make it to these stairs I
figured<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.070> is<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.280> only<00:05:04.430> way<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.670> do<00:05:04.850> it

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
figured this is the only way to do it

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.170 
figured this is the only way to do it
but<00:05:05.180> it's<00:05:06.050> not<00:05:06.170> like<00:05:06.290> there's<00:05:06.470> no<00:05:06.700> white<00:05:07.700> wall

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
but it's not like there's no white wall

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.780 
but it's not like there's no white wall
white<00:05:09.050> floor<00:05:09.770> at<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.070> bottom

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.930 

oh<00:05:15.820> wait<00:05:16.660> whoa<00:05:16.990> wait<00:05:17.350> okay<00:05:17.800> okay<00:05:18.340> okay<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.850> think

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
oh wait whoa wait okay okay okay I think

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.260 
oh wait whoa wait okay okay okay I think
I<00:05:19.150> got<00:05:19.300> idea<00:05:20.280> if<00:05:21.280> if<00:05:21.700> I'm<00:05:22.000> right<00:05:22.240> on<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:24.270> yup

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
I got idea if if I'm right on this yup

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.160 
I got idea if if I'm right on this yup
yeah<00:05:25.750> oh<00:05:26.080> man<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:26.920> was<00:05:27.040> that<00:05:27.250> was<00:05:27.370> genius

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
yeah oh man that was that was genius

I mean really enrichment center the
quality<00:05:46.270> of<00:05:46.390> our<00:05:46.510> test<00:05:46.780> subjects<00:05:47.260> has<00:05:47.440> risen

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
quality of our test subjects has risen

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.160 
quality of our test subjects has risen
dramatically<00:05:48.310> employee<00:05:49.210> retention<00:05:49.600> however

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
dramatically employee retention however

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.780 
dramatically employee retention however
has<00:05:50.920> not<00:05:51.870> as<00:05:52.870> a<00:05:53.110> result<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:54.370> may<00:05:54.520> have<00:05:54.640> heard

has not as a result you may have heard
we're<00:05:55.030> going<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.240> face<00:05:55.420> out<00:05:55.720> human<00:05:56.080> testing

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
we're going to face out human testing

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.280 
we're going to face out human testing
still<00:05:57.250> if<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.430> have<00:05:57.850> to<00:05:58.000> wrap<00:05:58.180> up<00:05:58.420> though<00:05:58.570> the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
not afford to buy $7 worth of moon rocks

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.670 
not afford to buy $7 worth of moon rocks
much<00:06:03.880> less<00:06:04.120> 70<00:06:04.570> million<00:06:04.810> bottom<00:06:05.470> anyway

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
much less 70 million bottom anyway

ground them up mix them into a gel and

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.230 
ground them up mix them into a gel and
guess<00:06:08.320> what<00:06:08.530> ground<00:06:09.160> up<00:06:09.310> moon<00:06:09.580> rocks<00:06:09.820> are<00:06:10.030> pure

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240
