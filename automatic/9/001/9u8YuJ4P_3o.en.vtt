00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.020
 neither a minivan if you are a single person these are the extremes without 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.130
 embargo 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.140
 there and vans that have four-cylinder engines and there are people who 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 they buy eight-cylinder engines with 8-cylinder trucks and they're 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.230
 simply spending more gasoline that they serve that is functional 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.520
 vehicle that he is choosing and third that he likes 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.340
 if you do not like it if you despair 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.840
 the street 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.780
 because sooner or later it is even worse in the neighbor's farm and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 he stayed with his vehicle for the next four years surely if 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.320
 you are going to sell your vehicle oo 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 he wants to leave the dealership to buy the new car that really 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.759
 We do this 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.420
 It is the best thing that can happen to you 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.150
 many times we think that they are not paying very cheap but look at the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.290
 security are the guarantee that they will change owner p not 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.170
 knows the person to whom they are going to sell it but finally the concessionaire 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 is responsible for that sale the assurance that they will not give you a 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.759
 plastic check in these times of Christmas or that they will not be a fraud 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.869

 security that you can provide to your family and thus stays with the vehicle 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.650
 again if you have a close relative, maybe you can give it a little more 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.530
 expensive remember you have to change the owner never left a vehicle 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.370
