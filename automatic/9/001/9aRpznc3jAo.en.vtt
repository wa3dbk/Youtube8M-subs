00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.900 
gadget hacks and today I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> create<00:00:04.020> double<00:00:04.560> exposure<00:00:05.160> images

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
you how to create double exposure images

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.740 
you how to create double exposure images
or<00:00:06.150> videos<00:00:06.810> using<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:08.040> free<00:00:08.429> iOS<00:00:09.000> application

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
or videos using a free iOS application

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.120 
or videos using a free iOS application
called<00:00:10.820> fuse<00:00:11.820> double<00:00:12.750> exposure<00:00:13.170> video<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
called fuse double exposure video and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.220 
called fuse double exposure video and
photo<00:00:14.820> blender<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.730> double<00:00:18.539> exposure<00:00:18.840> video

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
photo blender so a double exposure video

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
photo blender so a double exposure video
is<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.430> sorry<00:00:20.820> image<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.510> video<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:24.060> have

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is a or sorry image or video is you have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689 
is a or sorry image or video is you have
two<00:00:24.480> pictures<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:26.010> basically<00:00:26.220> blend

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
two pictures and you basically blend

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
two pictures and you basically blend
them<00:00:26.849> together<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:28.230> image<00:00:28.859> may<00:00:29.039> have

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
them together now one image may have

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
them together now one image may have
more<00:00:29.369> exposure<00:00:29.699> than<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> other<00:00:30.179> which

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
more exposure than the other which

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.590 
more exposure than the other which
ultimately<00:00:31.170> leads<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.550> ghost-like<00:00:33.149> image

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
ultimately leads to one ghost-like image

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100 
ultimately leads to one ghost-like image
so<00:00:34.820> let's<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.969> ahead<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.390> show<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.780> exactly

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so let's go ahead and show you exactly

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130 
so let's go ahead and show you exactly
how<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.370> look<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> let's<00:00:39.960> actually

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
how this is gonna look so let's actually

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.810 
how this is gonna look so let's actually
put<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.670> up

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
put this all right it's all the way up

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
put this all right it's all the way up
so<00:00:42.510> let's<00:00:42.780> open<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.170> fused<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.800> we're<00:00:46.800> just

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so let's open up fused and we're just

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
so let's open up fused and we're just
gonna<00:00:47.190> basically<00:00:47.820> select<00:00:48.180> two<00:00:48.390> images<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
gonna basically select two images or you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
gonna basically select two images or you
can<00:00:49.590> select<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.010> combination<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> an<00:00:50.789> image<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
can select a combination of an image in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
can select a combination of an image in
a<00:00:51.300> video<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:52.100> two<00:00:53.100> videos<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.699> let's<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.449> ahead

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
a video or two videos but let's go ahead

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
a video or two videos but let's go ahead
and<00:00:54.809> show<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.350> works<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.309> two

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and show you how it works with two

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
and show you how it works with two
images<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.780> ahead<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
images so I'm going to go ahead into the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
images so I'm going to go ahead into the
camera<00:00:59.250> roll<00:00:59.719> now<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> tends<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> work<00:01:01.440> well

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
camera roll now it tends to work well

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.070 
camera roll now it tends to work well
with<00:01:01.829> images<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.730> solid<00:01:03.120> colors<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
with images with solid colors for the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
with images with solid colors for the
initial<00:01:04.739> image<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> background<00:01:05.729> or

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
initial image and in the background or

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
initial image and in the background or
foreground<00:01:06.240> image<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.740> choose<00:01:08.040> some

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
foreground image I'm gonna choose some

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.990 
foreground image I'm gonna choose some
type<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> texture<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.729> mean<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.939> do

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
type of texture so I mean you can do

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.250 
type of texture so I mean you can do
whatever<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.659> doing<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
whatever you want I'm just doing this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
whatever you want I'm just doing this
I'm<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.159> an<00:01:14.909> image<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.540> bunch<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm gonna use an image of a bunch of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
I'm gonna use an image of a bunch of
rocks<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:18.619> there<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
rocks and there you go so it kind of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.660 
rocks and there you go so it kind of
blended<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
blended it so far and then you have your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
blended it so far and then you have your
tools<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.479> easily<00:01:25.020> accessible<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
tools right there easily accessible you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.969 
tools right there easily accessible you
have<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.850> blend<00:01:27.450> tool<00:01:27.689> first<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.860> we're

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
have the blend tool first one that we're

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.649 
have the blend tool first one that we're
gonna<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.250> through<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> adjustment

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
gonna go through you have the adjustment

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
gonna go through you have the adjustment
tool<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> lets<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.650> um<00:01:31.829> adjust<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
tool or it lets you um adjust the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.539 
tool or it lets you um adjust the
exposure<00:01:33.509> contrast<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.500> brightness<00:01:34.549> then

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
exposure contrast and brightness then

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.280 
exposure contrast and brightness then
you<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> masking<00:01:36.450> tool<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> which

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you have the masking tool with it which

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
you have the masking tool with it which
is<00:01:37.500> um<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> most<00:01:38.700> value

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is um I think one of the most value

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
is um I think one of the most value
tools<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.259> arrangement

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
tools and then you have the arrangement

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
tools and then you have the arrangement
tool<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.369> lets<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> crop<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> images<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
tool which lets you crop the images and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
tool which lets you crop the images and
turn<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:44.460> stuff<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
turn them and do stuff like that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
turn them and do stuff like that
so<00:01:45.630> let's<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.869> ahead<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> first<00:01:47.180> two

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so let's go ahead and do the first two

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.300 
so let's go ahead and do the first two
land-use<00:01:48.689> blend<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:49.799> choose<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:52.310> little

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
land-use blend so let's choose a little

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
land-use blend so let's choose a little
preset<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.570> adjust<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> intensity

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
preset you can adjust the intensity

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550 
preset you can adjust the intensity
right<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> different

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
right here so they have different

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.219 
right here so they have different
effects<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.689> looks<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> cool

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
effects so this one looks kind of cool

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
effects so this one looks kind of cool
you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> skull<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
you can really see the skull and the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.080 
you can really see the skull and the
rocks<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> might<00:02:03.899> end<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.110> using<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.590> one

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
rocks so I might end up using this one

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
rocks so I might end up using this one
so<00:02:06.090> let's<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.270> ahead<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> choose<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
so let's go ahead and choose that and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
so let's go ahead and choose that and
then<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.829> said<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.429> other

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
tools you can adjust the exposure and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.460 
tools you can adjust the exposure and
what<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> want<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.750> want<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.020> be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
what you want I want it to be

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.090 
what you want I want it to be
pretty<00:02:14.400> noticeable<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.180> let's<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.950> this

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
pretty noticeable so let's go with this

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000 
pretty noticeable so let's go with this
one<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.140> check<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.710> then

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
one and then let's just check and then

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.090 
one and then let's just check and then
here's<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:21.110> masking<00:02:22.110> tool<00:02:22.230> which<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.620> awesome

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
here's the masking tool which is awesome

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
here's the masking tool which is awesome
because<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.550> actually<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:24.300> rid<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
because you can actually get rid of the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780 
because you can actually get rid of the
overlays<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.990> X<00:02:28.170> excess<00:02:28.830> overlay<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
overlays the X excess overlay if you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.280 
overlays the X excess overlay if you
don't<00:02:29.970> want<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.810> makes<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
don't want it it actually makes the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.770 
don't want it it actually makes the
picture<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.820> lot<00:02:33.150> cooler<00:02:33.480> you'll<00:02:33.750> see

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
picture look a lot cooler you'll see

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.330 
picture look a lot cooler you'll see
right<00:02:34.140> now<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:34.920> I'm<00:02:35.130> done<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:38.070> check<00:02:38.100> that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
right now once I'm done so check that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
right now once I'm done so check that
out<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:42.390> let's<00:02:43.320> say<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> did<00:02:44.160> too<00:02:44.340> much<00:02:44.550> like

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
out and let's say I did too much like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420 
out and let's say I did too much like
let's<00:02:45.570> say<00:02:45.720> actually<00:02:46.200> erase<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.340> on

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
let's say actually erase right here on

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
let's say actually erase right here on
the<00:02:47.550> skulls<00:02:47.880> face<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.290> actually<00:02:49.380> just

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the skulls face you can actually just

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500 
the skulls face you can actually just
tap<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.220> tool<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.760> it'll<00:02:50.910> give<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
tap this tool and it'll give you the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.110 
tap this tool and it'll give you the
paintbrush<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.490> put<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.610> overlay

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
paintbrush so you can put that overlay

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.840 
paintbrush so you can put that overlay
texture<00:02:54.930> back<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.430> adjust<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
texture back on and you can adjust the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.460 
texture back on and you can adjust the
size<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.900> brush<00:02:59.180> or<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.990> eraser

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
size of the the brush or the eraser

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.280 
size of the the brush or the eraser
right<00:03:01.650> there<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.580> saw<00:03:02.959> that's<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.140> little

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
right there as you saw that's a little

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.080 
right there as you saw that's a little
too<00:03:04.440> small

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.360 

so<00:03:10.660> check<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.870> out<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.560> looks<00:03:11.770> way<00:03:12.340> cooler

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
so check that out that looks way cooler

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.040 
so check that out that looks way cooler
than<00:03:12.730> what<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.239> started<00:03:13.599> with<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.520> I<00:03:15.580> got<00:03:15.819> this

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
than what we started with so I got this

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.290 
than what we started with so I got this
skull<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.230> looks<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:18.030> bunch<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.090> rocks

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
skull that looks like a bunch of rocks

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.780 
skull that looks like a bunch of rocks
as<00:03:19.480> well<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.680> then<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.830> have<00:03:21.040> your<00:03:21.250> exporting

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
as well and then you have your exporting

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.150 
as well and then you have your exporting
tool<00:03:21.940> right<00:03:22.030> here<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.510> that'll

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
tool right here and that'll

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.839 
tool right here and that'll
automatically<00:03:24.160> save<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.580> your<00:03:24.670> camera

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
roll and you can also just tap this

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.059 
roll and you can also just tap this
right<00:03:28.300> here<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.660> start<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.170> new<00:03:29.319> project<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
right here and start a new project and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.430 
right here and start a new project and
like<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.640> said<00:03:30.880> let's<00:03:31.330> say<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.480> had<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> video<00:03:31.959> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
like I said let's say I had a video of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.020 
like I said let's say I had a video of
you<00:03:32.680> know<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> sky<00:03:33.250> let's<00:03:33.580> just<00:03:33.730> say<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:33.849> had<00:03:34.000> a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
you know the sky let's just say I had a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.449 
you know the sky let's just say I had a
video<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.360> could<00:03:34.690> actually<00:03:35.040> make<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
video I could actually make it so the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.000 
video I could actually make it so the
video<00:03:36.670> was<00:03:36.970> only<00:03:37.450> inside<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.080> skulls<00:03:38.500> face

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
video was only inside of the skulls face

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.800 
video was only inside of the skulls face
if<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.340> wanted<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.640> doing<00:03:40.030> exactly<00:03:40.390> what<00:03:40.599> I<00:03:40.660> did
