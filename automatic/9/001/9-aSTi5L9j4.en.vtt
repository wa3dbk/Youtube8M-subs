00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
Pikachu form codes form five i believe

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.480 
Pikachu form codes form five i believe
it's<00:01:11.070> tough<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.830> clever<00:01:13.830> cute<00:01:14.189> beautiful

it's tough and clever cute beautiful

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's tough and clever cute beautiful
cool<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.180> normal<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> course<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
cool and then normal of course so you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
cool and then normal of course so you
can<00:01:19.170> basically<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.710> change<00:01:20.009> its<00:01:20.280> form

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
can basically just change its form

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
can basically just change its form
without<00:01:21.330> changing<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> move<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.470> guess<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
without changing it to move I guess is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
without changing it to move I guess is
the<00:01:23.009> point<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> or<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.689> you
