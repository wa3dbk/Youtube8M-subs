00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.630
 the goiÃ¡s government appealed 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.490
 to determine that the demonstrators who 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 are camped outside the headquarters of the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 state government vacate the space 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 but according to commission members 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.699
 movement's organizer, there is still no 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 nothing official so far we are not 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.630
 modified is officially of this decision 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
 We wait and see if we can 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 really is or is not this request 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 to take him out of our camp here and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 Our only aim is to be 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 called right to with little numbers 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020
 increase the effective number of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350
 military police the camp 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.899
 already lasted 48 days according to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.210
 members of the movement the intention is to stay 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.940
 to enter into an agreement with the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 state government for demonstrators 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 they are pursuing their rights since 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.079
 are part of the reserve register and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 were approved in the competition 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.840
 We have the right to this position because there 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.140
 understanding of stj and stf is and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.220
 jurisprudence that if the call for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.500
 during a public call for tenders 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.110
 who approved in the reserve register or 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 even exceed the number of vacancies is 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 state duty to convene approved 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 in a public contest 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 in the public action request the government 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 alleges that the camp obstructs the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 transit of pedestrians and disrupts 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.970
 flow of cars that is already complicated in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.610
 region 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 but the demonstrators disagree with the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 already sees that the smtt itself 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.990
 has already passed an award until the government 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.060
 shows so it is flowing normally 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.860
 The mayor also also sent 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.720
 the sidewalks issue was not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.250
 disturbing the pds 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.590
 In this study the event is not 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.049
 hindering even placing count 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 so that you could pass safely and 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.399
 sidewalk is not completely obstructed the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.860
 group argues that it does not want to dispute 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.740
 vacancies with the temporary police 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.560
 voluntary military interest service 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 especially the yes I saw the idea is to add in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 population
