 obsession to own it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.440
 it is believed that he possesses a supernatural power 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.380
 unimaginable since the stranger 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 manuscript according to the legend is the work of 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.890

 your soul to the devil in order to be able 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.680
 write the legend the legend points 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 that the author of the codex gigas was a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 Benedictine monk condemned to be 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.160
 sandwich alive for a serious crime and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
 so that it was condoned it the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.170
 monk proposed creating a monumental work 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.880
 that would honor the monastery a codex that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.670
 would contain the bible and all the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.980
 knowledge of the world time 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.370
 stipulated by the same monk was one 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.380
 night the monk's task was superhuman 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.110
 so it is said that he requested the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.850
 help from satan himself who accepted 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.310
 create the book in one night by putting 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.150
 as a condition to appear your image in a 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.520
 of the origin pages a note on the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.560
 first sheet of codex giga is established 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.470
 to a Benedictine monastery in Bohemia 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 I could make it close to your din as a first 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.769
 known owner of the manuscript 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 it is unlikely that this huge book 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.450
 had been written in power I made it the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.700
 monastery was too small and 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 too poor to carry out such 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.860
 advanced company that requires huge 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.290
 human and material resources up 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.410
 where we know no other manuscript 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.870
 medieval is preserved from the monastery 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.269
 name of the codex scribe gigas is not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.370
 knows but it has been conjectured that it was the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.530
 monk brother whose name and nickname 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.900
 even his brother monachus sister 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.780
 imprisoned monk appears on 10 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.790
 November in the obituary the epithet 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.950
 was even linked with the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.560
 Legend of the book is believed that the monk 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.599
 He isolated himself from the world through penance and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.299
 He dedicated himself to writing the book as part 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.489
 of his punishment then then transcribe 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:07.640
 a sacred text was considered a 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:10.040
 way to redeem history 1200 4.230 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.110
 it is believed that the book was created in these 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.329
 dates this is based on the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.079
 inclusion of the saint bohemian san procÃ³pio 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.260
 canonized in 1,204 in the calendar and 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.360

 considered one of the wonders 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.230
 of the world it is not clear if this purchase 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.010
 it was carried out at 1,295 since gregorio

 he was elected bishop of Prague only in a thousand 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.230
