and you guys said you really enjoyed it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.060 
and you guys said you really enjoyed it
so<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.869> asked<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.289> comment<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> video

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
so I asked you to comment on the video

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.800 
so I asked you to comment on the video
telling<00:00:26.519> me<00:00:26.609> which<00:00:26.849> monster<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
telling me which monster you want me to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.400 
telling me which monster you want me to
do<00:00:27.960> next

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
do next

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.099 
do next
and<00:00:28.529> by<00:00:29.099> far<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.580> most<00:00:29.699> popular<00:00:29.880> answer<00:00:30.510> was

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and by far the most popular answer was

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.100 
and by far the most popular answer was
ragging<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.099> let's<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
ragging so let's do this first up I can

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
ragging so let's do this first up I can
understand<00:00:34.440> why<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.280> asked<00:00:35.430> me<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
understand why a lot of you asked me to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.260 
understand why a lot of you asked me to
cover<00:00:35.850> Raja

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
cover Raja

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.209 
cover Raja
he<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.170> royal<00:00:37.530> pain<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> backside

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
he can be a royal pain in the backside

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
he can be a royal pain in the backside
and<00:00:38.640> does<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> tendency<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.350> give<00:00:40.469> even

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and does have a tendency to give even

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
and does have a tendency to give even
the<00:00:40.890> best<00:00:41.129> hunters<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> run<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:41.940> their<00:00:42.030> money

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the best hunters a run for their money

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
the best hunters a run for their money
as<00:00:43.110> far<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.440> physiology<00:00:44.040> goes<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.700> leg

as far as physiology goes the right leg

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
as far as physiology goes the right leg
actually<00:00:45.329> strongly<00:00:45.780> resembles<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> blank

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
actually strongly resembles the blank

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
actually strongly resembles the blank
alga<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.340> hunter<00:00:47.610> freedom<00:00:47.760> -<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
alga for most hunter freedom - and it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
alga for most hunter freedom - and it
even<00:00:49.079> borrows<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.620> his<00:00:49.710> attacks<00:00:50.010> however

even borrows some of his attacks however
despite<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.420> Raja<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.110> quite<00:00:52.320> obviously

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
despite that Raja is quite obviously

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.279 
despite that Raja is quite obviously
much<00:00:53.010> bigger<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.940> muscly<00:00:54.300> hits<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.960> hell<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> a

ball or in a long beam and it's usually
the<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.220> kills<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.360> also

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the one that kills me but it's also

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.380 
the one that kills me but it's also
rather<00:01:10.020> easy<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.619> predict<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.210> watch

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
rather easy to predict if you watch

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.149 
rather easy to predict if you watch
measuring<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.960> quite<00:01:13.200> easy<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.560> tell<00:01:13.770> when

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
measuring it's quite easy to tell when

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
measuring it's quite easy to tell when
he's<00:01:14.369> getting<00:01:14.520> ready<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.150> move<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
he's getting ready to do this move so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240 
he's getting ready to do this move so
provided<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> middle<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> an

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
attack animation or stunned then you can

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
attack animation or stunned then you can
quite<00:01:19.740> simply<00:01:19.890> either<00:01:20.220> reposition<00:01:20.820> yourself

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
quite simply either reposition yourself

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.039 
quite simply either reposition yourself

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
roll won't pass through it so unless you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.280 
roll won't pass through it so unless you
have<00:01:26.939> invasion<00:01:27.479> plus<00:01:27.630> three<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.170> I'd

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
have invasion plus three now I'd

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
have invasion plus three now I'd
recommend<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> dive<00:01:28.979> instead<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.060> needless

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
recommend the dive instead but needless

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
recommend the dive instead but needless
to<00:01:30.420> say<00:01:30.509> once<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> realise<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.590> it's

much do this move then you'll find you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.240 
much do this move then you'll find you

a spinning slap on the ground in G rank
he'll<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.020> times<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> row<00:02:01.740> and

he'll do this three times in a row and

he'll do this three times in a row and
it<00:02:02.310> hurts<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.600> while<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.200> initial

honestly suggest simply putting your

weapon away and sprinting see the
problem<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.830> attack<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.550> once

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.100 
hit as do most monsters but quite
obviously<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:29.330> also<00:04:29.570> where<00:04:29.900> you're<00:04:30.020> most

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
obviously it's also where you're most

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.140 
obviously it's also where you're most
vulnerable<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:31.250> second<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.760> if<00:04:31.970> you're

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
vulnerable so second to that if you're

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.820 
vulnerable so second to that if you're
using<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.510> cutting<00:04:32.810> type<00:04:32.960> weapon<00:04:33.290> then<00:04:33.680> its

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
using a cutting type weapon then its

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.350 
using a cutting type weapon then its
tail<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.250> next<00:04:34.670> most<00:04:34.850> vulnerable<00:04:35.060> spot

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
tail is the next most vulnerable spot

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240 
tail is the next most vulnerable spot
while<00:04:36.080> if<00:04:36.200> you're<00:04:36.320> using<00:04:36.470> an<00:04:36.620> impact<00:04:36.950> weapon

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
while if you're using an impact weapon

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.460 
while if you're using an impact weapon
it's<00:04:37.490> actually<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.090> torso<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.230> event

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
it's actually the torso so in the event

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.840 
it's actually the torso so in the event
that<00:04:39.500> you're<00:04:39.680> fighting<00:04:39.830> raging<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.670> have

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
that you're fighting raging and you have

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.640 
that you're fighting raging and you have
no<00:04:41.060> need<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.330> break<00:04:41.480> its<00:04:41.660> horns<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.290> simply

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
no need to break its horns then simply

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.770 
no need to break its horns then simply
stay<00:04:42.890> by<00:04:43.040> its<00:04:43.160> side<00:04:43.400> by<00:04:43.970> its<00:04:44.150> hind<00:04:44.330> legs<00:04:44.420> and

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
stay by its side by its hind legs and

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.510 
stay by its side by its hind legs and
from<00:04:45.230> here<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.770> have<00:04:45.890> a<00:04:45.920> great<00:04:46.190> chance<00:04:46.220> to

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
from here you have a great chance to

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.400 
from here you have a great chance to
trip<00:04:46.700> it<00:04:46.790> up<00:04:46.880> by<00:04:47.210> attacking<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.630> legs<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.380> you

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
trip it up by attacking the legs but you

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.050 
trip it up by attacking the legs but you
also<00:04:48.710> near<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.010> torso<00:04:49.370> which<00:04:49.610> still<00:04:49.880> does

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
also near the torso which still does

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.910 
also near the torso which still does
decent<00:04:50.480> damage<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.260> if<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.500> know<00:04:51.620> it's<00:04:51.770> safe

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
decent damage and if you know it's safe

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.220 
decent damage and if you know it's safe
then<00:04:52.340> you're<00:04:52.460> right<00:04:52.670> by<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.880> tail<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
then you're right by the tail but in the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.210 
then you're right by the tail but in the
same<00:04:54.380> way<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.710> wouldn't<00:04:54.950> stand<00:04:55.100> in

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
same way that you wouldn't stand in

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.860 
same way that you wouldn't stand in
front<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.430> its<00:04:55.580> head<00:04:55.610> at<00:04:55.820> all<00:04:55.910> times<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.690> also

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
front of its head at all times you also

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.270 
front of its head at all times you also
don't<00:04:57.080> want<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.320> stand<00:04:57.440> behind<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.920> at<00:04:58.070> all

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
don't want to stand behind it at all

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.950 
don't want to stand behind it at all
times<00:04:58.490> because<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.060> kicks<00:04:59.240> back<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.630> that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
times because it kicks back and that

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.800 
times because it kicks back and that
also<00:05:00.110> hurts<00:05:00.500> so<00:05:01.310> stick<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.610> aside<00:05:01.910> by<00:05:02.480> its<00:05:02.630> hind

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
also hurts so stick it aside by its hind

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.210 
also hurts so stick it aside by its hind
legs<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.500> want<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.680> only<00:05:03.800> find<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:04.130> much

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
legs and you want to only find it much

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.100 
legs and you want to only find it much

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
easier to avoid being hit but you'll
