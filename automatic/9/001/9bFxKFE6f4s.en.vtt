00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.390
 occasion I come from version 2.0 that 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.700
 since it was highly anticipated by all that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 follow 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.980
 Well the link I'll leave it in the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 description of the video that in this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.030
 I'm uploading the file 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 there 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.720
 well you are going to give to download 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.650
 wait 20 seconds and download it 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.970

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.830
 as i will show you now 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 a file file account 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.370
 inside this file comes what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.370
 it would be the game 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 the game and the complete fork as 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.409
 in the gba the previous versions of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 silo 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.860
 they did not have the complete departure a venia 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.000
 so now it comes with the death of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.190

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.159
 good one that bring that 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.899
 they will stay 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899
 a folder like that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 would be 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.159
 but they remained on his back and he was coming 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.450
 Excellent 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.999
 in this idea I did not concentrate much on 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.230
 the good ones and in everything here we have a 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:05.450
 new but 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.470
 after they have extracted the mud 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.819
 you have to open up good I'm not going 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.530

 good to place the full game 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.670
 they have to bring this our 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.800

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
 and with the letter l also 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.780
 turn off the lights of the off 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.930
