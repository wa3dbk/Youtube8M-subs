 television with in the background 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 two times a ktm unfortunately does not iron 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 yourself is not known at all but just 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 nice two kempink buckets 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
 one on software with the mtx his anne 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 is also on t with the ripper and that is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 all just a little bit 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.009
 for the background 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.510
 because I'm talking to you about something 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.710
 otherwise I want to be with you 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 have something else and that's the new one 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 cove does that natural one 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.559
 soon on a ' ran smoothly 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.850
 he will arrive in the trick and there 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.910
 they are now working on the development 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 days so i then go chinese 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.579
 trypsin because 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 myides and evides bit to discuss 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.149
 Perhaps a little discussion your 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 is below in the comments 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.079
 in the comments and I just want my 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 give an opinion that I think they do 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.280
 maybe the godfather can or that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.850
 should the exhausts anyway I am so will 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.949
 very happy that they are new model affair 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 continuing a-series course is quite a lot 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.320
 big plus because was all with 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.110
 pretty true v2 modem just a43 to the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 Best series of the shortest one belongs 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.439
 of the best series my opinion and then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.259
 I myself am capable of a modem for which 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.150
 two only good despite my age 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 I predict all other games 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.270
 so you know a little how and what 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 it's all put together myself 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 only played no blackops and so 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.540
 just a normal call to the black 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 his knee did play blackops two and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 good if you like all the games a bit 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 you can find each other for you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 so I think about that for my opinion 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 anyway I made the biggest mistake with 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.299
 blackops and two blackops was natural 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.030
 no major kill settlement was created 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.369
 in the sense of a new and moab about tm 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 fight and I am glad that because of this 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.220
 a modern warfare 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.020
 series is you actually know of 9 and 9 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.720
 9% of course also you could be sure that there 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.149
 something is coming in the hand of 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.069
 between 20 and 30 tales 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.319
 Slightly crowded street the city of Sino 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.149
 plus to have something you really have 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.979
 a nice goal to really lead 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 play that mystic with 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.489
 You should go to Blackops 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
 nuclear fetch only that was from one 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 emblem in you 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.590
 driver we so to speak 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.799
 and it stopped even though it 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 game itself was okay I think it is 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.680
 not one of the best i don't think so 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.880
 the all worst but guess that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.040
 perhaps the one worst is one 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.780
 place on yes and maybe so 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 yes i look the black is a response and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.110
 that was purely because i just did that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.269
 nothing from the cell nothing in terms of 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.380
 challenge it was just mainly 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.690
 chilly and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.269
 for my opinion was for my feeling 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.349
 it just not quite in two blackops 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.590
 I am in there by my half year 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.590
 played well and yes a little fluctuates 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.940
 now i 'm very happy that 9 9.9 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.819
 percent is sure that there is another one 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.500
 killstreak and coiffeurs must 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.810
 they are going to tackle things very differently 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.190
 still human at least not attachments 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.420
 but really let us think they did that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.040
 must pack 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.630
 things like my own ideas ms i know 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.299
 not who has kissed those things but 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.000
 really me good they really just have to 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.760
 yes lost in one way or another 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.109
 of them might sit with them all 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.760
 would perish a table so we go to 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.590
 we are going to offer that loan 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.280
 by day but this is really the most 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.959
 annoying annoying litho 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.540
 that the sit I think I do then 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.549
 with my so the puck layout that you are 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.260
 now in coaching the find it completely top 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.280
 that you with your point system of course 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.329
 can work that's just awful 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.980
 yummy 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.840
 that you can spend your point yourself 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.420
 can save yourself for point seeing them 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.280
 the prestige system a bit easy 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.019
 to be able to make it I don't benefit so much 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 to go my whole man 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.489
 customizing so there is falling here and there 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.549
 overall, still a lot 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.409
 make a profit say a lot of profit too 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.950
 books 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:54.900
 on the contrary, I think that might be something 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.849
 something old must happen 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.760
 so would the pro version 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.129
 versions so the pro versions of certain 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.829
 Perch I just think that would be the case 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.470
 have to come and like you 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.720
 for example suppose you are on a 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.799
 I call 12 street with my 12 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 street and I think that's another one 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.879
 hours are my ponies a specialist 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.130
 call or duty ghost you have an insult and 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.930
 perch you have selected 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.489
 in you walk in my opinion that if 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.660
 Do you have some other tales death 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.220
 note the memory just that whole bonus 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 away as it looks now 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.449
 and then you just do it as a specialist 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.430
 just all boiling point a specialist with 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.220
 everything on pim that you then just 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.570
 really just in motor it is a self 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.430
 bit like and become some hippie 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.500
 of course only now okay maybe 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.970
 then of course you can 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.849
 just have those and looks and then 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.949
 just yes until something else is going to do and 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.510
 maybe still go skiing a bit 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.580
 with the purge i do n't know exactly how 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.340
 that would really like me am well 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.789
 Believed to be pro perth and already special 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.830
 per 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.039
 system say that should be real 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.590
 come back again and not if so grave 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.090
 falls as it is and now you miss old 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.560
 do you think yes you will die on one 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.330
 In a way I had that in pairs and 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.919
 so I go too deep and next tip 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.419
 you die and you think hd type 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.979
 but sit on it and you have it again 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.139
 old well holder food you see so too 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.199
 I gotta screw things up and I think so 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.849
 for other players also quite 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.680
 easy when it is just on 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.760
 that you just become a retina mini skill 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.169
 can get 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.699
 so that is of course very bad 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.440
 which is important to me too 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.289
 is important and seeing with chose is 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.409
 an ultimate example of that is allowed 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.550
 not great and you know the myth 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.229
 size of stone is not required 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.180
 actually of the three splitter is mine 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.430
 opinion whether the two you make further too 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.800
 no matter the couple of large maps in between 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.870
 but sit where I still have a note 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.729
 irritates its say if you have a house 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.190
 you have 40 floors in it 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.820
 40 to it 's 40 also is only someone in it 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.150
 camper and kempen is not bad in itself 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.560
 because if you are a bit on what the 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.510
 situation is when you are afraid of it 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.909
 die because you have obstruction then it is 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.470
 take something else that you immediately 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.120
 in the beginning 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.650
 of pot in immediately go again 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.940
 You understand that you go straight to the corner 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.580
 I go so that is also very bad 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.620
 I think it's important that you love your spawns 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.350
 just better rule is maybe win the 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.850
 sponge and fewer corners fewer houses 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.220
 leave a comment below what 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.870
 you will find in a hope that you have resources 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.430
 can discuss this I say thank you 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.760
 for watching and until next time 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.760
 boys
