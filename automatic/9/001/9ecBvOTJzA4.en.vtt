00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
sure the only two are the volumes all

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.430

three<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.040> them<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:46.390> close<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:46.870> minimize

window<00:03:48.120> those<00:03:49.120> work<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.489> there<00:03:51.730> are<00:03:51.760> some

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
window those work I think there are some

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.770 
window those work I think there are some
some<00:03:54.549> modifications<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.299> make<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.660> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
some modifications you can make in the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.030 
some modifications you can make in the
actual<00:03:56.940> keyboard<00:03:57.940> layout<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.829> work

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
actual keyboard layout to make that work

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.590 
actual keyboard layout to make that work
but<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.820> going<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.090> show<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.269> guys<00:04:01.420> that

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
but I'm not going to show you guys that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.780 
but I'm not going to show you guys that
right<00:04:01.750> now<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:02.019> think<00:04:02.500> she<00:04:02.769> rocks<00:04:03.190> has<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> video

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
and the default password if you haven't

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.590 
and the default password if you haven't
changed<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.650> already<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.100> user<00:05:30.610> once<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.450> type
