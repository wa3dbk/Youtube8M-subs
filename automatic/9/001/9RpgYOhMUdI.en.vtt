00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.420
 you find yourself in columbia looking for 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.260

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.090
 characters the truth quite pretty 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.790
 and most importantly the software is 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.130
 apart from fact with as if it were a 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.120
 separate package 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.379

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.379
 very nice in what for 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.180
 bernanke cold 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.760
 are those of good vox populi that when 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.910
 with the game they will know and your 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.950
 evidently 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.910
 I'm going to take it out like this is going to stay like that 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.880
 I'm going to take it out like that but wow 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.239
 it's amazing and it came right in these 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.470
 moments as you can see so they are done 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.030
 things no longer happen and so they went through 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 the blunting and now if it comes by 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.480
 return to my lair for those who know 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.480

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.129

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:58.389

00:04:50.110 --> 00:05:00.720
