00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
 finally if you present the second 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 generation 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 China had discovered the clear 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.700
 a technology that allows it to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.250
 empty the water and the cifop shown a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 foam after was not too fast 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.740
 beautiful linen 40 points 8 on a year if 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 the standard the main benefits 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.150
 are a better sound of the linen and the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 combinards j because we made it possible 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 to wash cold a cold is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 corner if they were at 15.81 I could 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 that efficiency at 40 Â° it was present 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 at 40 degrees to squeeze us to soissons 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.489
 of grid because you even more 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.799
 in addition to delicate textiles on the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.129
 market be careful the temperature of 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:43.530
 washing 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.420
 so that's the technology then 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 the main improvements by the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 year on his new range are on the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.799
 outdoor design times outdoor asses 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.869
 because the machine has issued often in 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.479
 the kitchen is visible so we have 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:00.150
 a lot worked on the forte with a 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.920
 design called sag the bone so a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.710
 specific coating with dupuis room 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 fire tonight on the intake or on the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 program section rotary knob 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 also a work on the screen on and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 samsung so we worked a lot on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 the brakes with sensitive keys 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 the blue led make 16 meters on 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.010
 all products in the range 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 so here is the exterior design 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.320
 also advances in terms of 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 sound level 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.370
 these machines are equipped with an engine 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.409
 digital and mrs martin it's a motor to 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.380
 induction that goes 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.569
 here the sound level of 6 decibels makes 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.130
 consistent and above all it's an engine 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.439
 which allows to have a visibility 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.810
 since these engines are guaranteed 10 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.520
 hours we also have all the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.259
 programs that are and rocket crumble 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.270
 foundry are improved as the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.920
 program for difficult task at 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.069
 faces that are all complicating life 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.679
 like the strawberry for example where the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.349
 lipstick spots there you have a 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.149
 prewash that bocoum that will allow 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.729
 to have a washing efficiency 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.619
 important with a temperature shows 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.219
 so we have a product that will allow 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.929
 to have 70% energy saving 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.709
 also have a preparation of your 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.709
 feet 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.709
