00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the hang of it and then you just do it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.480 
the hang of it and then you just do it
like<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.720> stir<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> wait

that's<00:01:38.820> almost<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> most<00:01:39.630> important<00:01:40.229> part

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that's almost the most important part

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's almost the most important part
because<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> cheek<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.880> blossoms<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
because the cheek kind of blossoms it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.590 
because the cheek kind of blossoms it
absorbs<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> lot<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> water<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.180> any

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
absorbs really a lot of water or any

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.280 
absorbs really a lot of water or any
liquid<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:48.090> makes<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> makes<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.020> gel

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
liquid and that makes it makes a gel

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.660 
liquid and that makes it makes a gel
around<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> which<00:01:49.979> kind<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> sticks

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
around it which kind of sticks

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
around it which kind of sticks
everything<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> cereal<00:01:51.659> together<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
everything in the cereal together so it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
everything in the cereal together so it
