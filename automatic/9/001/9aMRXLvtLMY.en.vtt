00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
we've got to assemble it and then put it

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.470 
we've got to assemble it and then put it
back<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.360> cook<00:02:08.950> I'm<00:02:09.950> gonna<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.549> so<00:02:10.939> in<00:02:11.150> layers

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
back to cook I'm gonna do so in layers

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.320 
back to cook I'm gonna do so in layers
so<00:02:11.629> here<00:02:12.139> I<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.340> two<00:02:13.340> pounds<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
so here I have two pounds and I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.060 
so here I have two pounds and I
will<00:02:14.480> list<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.140> ingredients<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
will list all the ingredients in the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.950 
will list all the ingredients in the
description<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.700> video<00:02:16.880> I've<00:02:17.570> got<00:02:17.810> here

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
description of this video I've got here

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.420 
description of this video I've got here
about<00:02:18.170> two<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> two<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.770> half<00:02:18.890> pounds<00:02:19.340> or

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
about two to two and a half pounds or

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.810 
about two to two and a half pounds or
salted<00:02:19.850> pig<00:02:20.120> tail<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.790> showed<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
salted pig tail that I showed you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.960 
salted pig tail that I showed you
earlier<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:24.430> boiling<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
earlier that I was boiling and the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.770 
earlier that I was boiling and the
reason<00:02:26.300> why<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.630> would<00:02:26.780> boil<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.450> remove

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
reason why we would boil it is to remove

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.320 
reason why we would boil it is to remove
most<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> salt<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.820> was<00:02:32.030> purer

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
most of the salt that this was purer

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.530 
most of the salt that this was purer
than<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.780> going<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.050> be<00:02:33.110> incredibly<00:02:33.740> salty

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
than it is going to be incredibly salty

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.060 
than it is going to be incredibly salty
put<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.630> cut<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.930> up<00:02:35.990> into<00:02:36.140> pieces<00:02:36.230> put<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
put it cut it up into pieces put it in a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.040 
put it cut it up into pieces put it in a
pot<00:02:37.280> cover<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.910> water<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.360> let<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.510> boil<00:02:38.780> for

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
pot cover with water and let it boil for

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.780 
pot cover with water and let it boil for
about<00:02:39.140> 40<00:02:39.650> minutes<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.460> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.700> help

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
about 40 minutes it's going to help

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.080 
about 40 minutes it's going to help
tenderize<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.630> as<00:02:41.780> well<00:02:42.140> as<00:02:42.730> remove<00:02:43.730> all<00:02:43.910> that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
tenderize it as well as remove all that

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.760 
tenderize it as well as remove all that
salt<00:02:44.420> I've<00:02:44.630> got<00:02:44.840> here<00:02:45.050> some<00:02:45.230> chicken<00:02:45.590> breast
