00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.070
 we are here with one of the most famous mariano di rai 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.600
 important bands a blogger of the moment 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.420
 you want to know first how it started 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.099
 your career but look how we have 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.290
 said before 18 years I left 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.050
 home I searched around for luck 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.250
 we say it went very well it was a 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 succession of coincidences 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.800
 fearful circumstance 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.640
 it was born so how important yours is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.079
 blog for your career as a model 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.220
 but it is certainly very much the race from 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.870
 photomodel in the call case 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.550
 parallel to everything that was born 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.489
 almost mind another blog was a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.940
 very very strong support because it is a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.970
 last question how it feels to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 be the most important fashion 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.809
 influencer of the moment both national and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.360
 international 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.040
 but certainly one is also very beautiful 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.110
 great responsibility because when you have 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.110
 so many people following you look at you 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.260
 you also feel the weight of that a little 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 which tells of what you tell then 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.360
 it is beautiful but it is present at the same time 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.660
 mariano di vaio wearer persson 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.290
 blogger actor but if you had to choose 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.480
 wheels where you feel more implemented if 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.130
 had to choose one of these 3 well 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.960
 right now probably choose the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 fashion because it is the one where I am 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.010
 managed to express a little better 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.300
 bigger fraction strength than me 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.560
 I bring it back when I 'm a little bit more 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.930
 small is acting 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.180
 but there is time we give time to tears 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.610
 maybe 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 have class for mariano di vaio thing 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.220
 means to be yourself a lot 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.420
 relax in what you do in everyone 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.950
 how many those who at the time 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.770
 they are good with the same then they succeed 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.570
 to have class in what they do is the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.490
 your first experience in the world of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.220
 fashion presentations 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.860
 my first experience was several 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.060
 parma years and fortunately I left 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.409
 great for there is the campaign of 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.780
 roberto cavalli was a great thing 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.640
 very very nice because I found myself with 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.039
 elisa sednaoui who was a supermodel and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.709
 at the moment it is a very long experience 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.170
 interesting from there then grow all the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.680
 rest is a greeting to all friends of the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.540
