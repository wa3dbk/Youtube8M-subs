Skyforge currently has in the game but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.460 
Skyforge currently has in the game but
mostly<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.060> concentrated<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.079> three<00:02:55.290> new

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
Berserker I found all of them to be

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.589 
Berserker I found all of them to be
really<00:02:59.250> fun<00:02:59.459> especially<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.060> light<00:03:00.269> binder

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
really fun especially the light binder

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.449 
really fun especially the light binder
and<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> gunner<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.440> after<00:03:01.890> six<00:03:02.099> hours<00:03:02.250> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and the gunner but after six hours of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.120 
and the gunner but after six hours of
playing<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.120> started<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.900> bored<00:03:04.380> maybe<00:03:04.920> as

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
playing I started to get bored maybe as

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.160 
playing I started to get bored maybe as
the<00:03:05.310> game<00:03:05.549> gets<00:03:05.730> further<00:03:06.030> along<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.750> combat

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the game gets further along the combat

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.800 
the game gets further along the combat
gets<00:03:07.380> deeper<00:03:07.799> but<00:03:08.069> at<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.549> point<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.180> found<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
gets deeper but at this point I found it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.479 
gets deeper but at this point I found it
to<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.019> bit<00:03:10.200> shallow<00:03:10.500> yeah<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.160> looks<00:03:11.400> pretty

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
to be a bit shallow yeah it looks pretty

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.610 
to be a bit shallow yeah it looks pretty
but<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.599> lot<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.810> clicking<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.500> may

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
but it's just a lot of clicking you may

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.440 
but it's just a lot of clicking you may
have<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.890> dodge<00:03:14.130> every<00:03:14.370> once<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.030> while<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
have to dodge every once in a while and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.940 
have to dodge every once in a while and
there's<00:03:15.569> no<00:03:15.690> huge<00:03:16.019> circles<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> ground

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
there's no huge circles on the ground

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.259 
there's no huge circles on the ground
telling<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.459> where<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.700> attack<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.030> gonna

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
telling you where the attack is gonna

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
change once you get higher level but I

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.600 
change once you get higher level but I
didn't<00:04:29.380> feel<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> urge<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:30.040> get<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.430> I
