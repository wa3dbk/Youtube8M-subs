with<00:01:08.800> software<00:01:09.190> absolutely<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> haven't<00:01:10.540> made

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
with software absolutely I haven't made

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.300 
with software absolutely I haven't made
the<00:01:10.810> decision<00:01:10.840> we<00:01:11.530> ever<00:01:11.620> made<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.950> decision

the decision we ever made the decision
to<00:01:12.520> what<00:01:12.820> software<00:01:13.090> pod<00:01:13.360> when<00:01:13.540> we're<00:01:13.660> going<00:01:13.780> to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
to what software pod when we're going to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.690 
to what software pod when we're going to
pick<00:01:14.050> ok<00:01:14.440> but<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:14.740> guys<00:01:14.860> will<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.280> will<00:01:15.400> be<00:01:15.430> so

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
pick ok but you guys will it will be so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.640 
pick ok but you guys will it will be so
it'll<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.570> some<00:01:16.840> kind<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.170> bundled<00:01:17.470> software

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
it'll have some kind of bundled software

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.050 
it'll have some kind of bundled software
it'll<00:01:18.250> be<00:01:18.370> something<00:01:18.670> great<00:01:19.330> ok<00:01:19.840> won't<00:01:20.050> be<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
it'll be something great ok won't be and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.180 
it'll be something great ok won't be and
again<00:01:22.330> again<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.720> won't<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:23.290> won't<00:01:23.500> control

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
again again it won't it won't control

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.130 
again again it won't it won't control
just<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.550> software<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.060> still<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.330> scene

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
just that software it's still a scene

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.540 
just that software it's still a scene
alone<00:01:26.320> controller<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:26.980> can<00:01:27.190> run<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.460> with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
alone controller so you can run it with

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.800 
alone controller so you can run it with
other<00:01:27.700> software<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.210> correct<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:28.690> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
other software is that correct so the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.870 
other software is that correct so the
mini<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.320> these<00:01:29.530> it's<00:01:29.860> they're<00:01:30.100> all<00:01:30.280> standard

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
mini on these it's they're all standard

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.070 
mini on these it's they're all standard
MIDI<00:01:31.090> controllers<00:01:31.660> they'll<00:01:31.900> work<00:01:32.050> with

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
MIDI controllers they'll work with

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.380 
MIDI controllers they'll work with
anything<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.100> takes<00:01:33.250> mitting<00:01:33.730> good<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.120> like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
anything that takes mitting good I like

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.540 
anything that takes mitting good I like
it<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.659> like<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:34.930> ok<00:01:35.260> cool<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.650> not<00:01:36.100> just<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
it I like it ok cool and not just the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.310 
it I like it ok cool and not just the
controller<00:01:36.940> but<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.240> actually<00:01:37.420> has<00:01:37.750> IO<00:01:38.020> as

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
controller but it actually has IO as

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.170 
controller but it actually has IO as
well<00:01:38.560> that's<00:01:38.920> correct<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.400> is<00:01:39.520> an<00:01:39.850> audio

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
well that's correct this is an audio

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180 
well that's correct this is an audio
interface<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.780> well<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.350> four-out<00:01:41.800> audio

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
interface as well it's a four-out audio

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.490 
interface as well it's a four-out audio
interface<00:01:42.580> beautiful<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.990> back

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
interface beautiful so on the back
