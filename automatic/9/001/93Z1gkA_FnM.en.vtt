00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.500
 this garden at creation is a garden 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 strictly academic as 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.380
 measure of history he became 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.450
 municipal 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.710
 many things have obviously changed 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.480
 since since the creation but the goal 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.020
 is the purpose of the garden remains always 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.540
 the same ie to create 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.570
 collections to keep from presenting the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.430
 plant diversity 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.559
 it's just maybe maybe a little 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.890
 little more a little more playful 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.550
 open to the biggest in the biggest world 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.370
 at the moment 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.110
 so now the most the role of the garden 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.970
 dujardin is actually there are three roles 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.860
 main 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.239
 it goes on the one hand by the mission of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.350
 conservation one must create 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.509
 collections as well collections 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.920
 of plants from exotic backgrounds 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.840
 so collections that we can see 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.340
 in the greenhouses but just as much it can 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
 be both collections such 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.280
 that fight flora Tuesday so that's 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960
 a collection of plants this 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 development spontaneously in our 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.220
 region it's also the missions 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.009
 scientists have collections 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's one thing but knowing how to handle them 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.200
 also know to be able to be in 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.080
 able to exchange them with others 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.180
 structures also know a point 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.470
 excessively important and then so 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.670
 this is the third role of the genre 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.399
 of habitat knicks and raise awareness 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.250
 raise awareness 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.740
 sensitize the world about biodiversity or 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.320
 the need to retain this 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.270
 this plant diversity so these 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.780
 moments it's actually these three roles get 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.240
 are really important for the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.299
 Botanical agents working 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.789
 so we have about we will say eight thousand 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.670
 different plant species in the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.130
 plant garden so a lot of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.110
 plants that come from backgrounds 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 natural for some threaten others 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.280
 it's just for the sake of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 present and then all this associated with 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 a diversity a little bit of plants 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.390
 grown for their flowering for the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 part approval here we present 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.930
 also plants that are there just 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.370
 to be pretty somewhere obviously 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.319
 we will all sectors of plants 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.810
 so useful so good plants 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.100
 edible textile plants 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.720
 plants 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.390
 also inform the public about 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.610
 poisonous plants we really try to 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.110
 to open the field of the fields of 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450
 possible on the greatest diversity 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.970
 possible plants we present 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 also all aspects related 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 sustainable development that tend towards 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.820
 the goal of zero phyto so all 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.350
 alternative techniques that goes through the 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.870
 mulching hot water grasslands by 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.240
 example as well as the creations of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.590
 massive - water consumers so we 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.260
 also try not to present that to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.120
 public that it's part of a little bit 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 of diversity the diversity of the world 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.660
 vegetal 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 it's true we have a few 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 subjects even though they are who are 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.320
 very interesting whether it's through their 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
 anatomy whether by their age so 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.810
 here are a lot of discoveries to 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.700
 do it on topics 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.130
 imposing only on plants that make 20 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.310
 cm high and really has a lot to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.050
 discover a botanical garden would not 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.570
 nothing without an orangery this one was 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.060
 built in 1860 to house a 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.530
 number of plants 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.730
 nevertheless there are many that we 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.350
 can only see that souza briche 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.160
 and that's what we'll see in 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.160
 entering the greenhouse 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.550
 so here we are on the domain of 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.510
 damien and we will meet him for 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.940
 that he introduces us to the main 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.230
 sectors and plants and some 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.740
 interesting plants among so many 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.990
 others then damien something 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.220
 of interesting additionally had to huawei here 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.100
 the age and the coffee tree that have flowers 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.010
 okay it promises a beautiful a beautiful 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.690
 harvest otherwise you really fall well I 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.910
 I was going to cut the fruit of the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.510
 ground body that's all just a 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.870
 hour yet it's 9am yeah but we 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.960
 let's press there he is he is a little soft 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.540
 so that means he's here and we're going 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.100
 see what taste and taste of sagua 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.500
 it's a rather special taste it tastes 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.250
 chewing gum a little bit of 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:36.670
 tomorrow the bar is special but 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:40.880
 it's nice so I want I'm going to cut 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:46.160
 I have other lanta opposite you see 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.420
 here the banana he pushed well there 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.810
 to grow but we have no fruit yet 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.360
 not yet but it will not be long 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.190
 he became quite fat English banana 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.830
 as and legal punishment agreement provides 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.840
 the brede good this one the nice boxes 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.330
 otherwise you see we have the cotton also the 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.419
 i10 is back to bloom because of having 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.480
 cotton in a few months so 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.250
 to rub on our approach is the same 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.460
 family that hibiscus what's it going 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.820
 to make a yellow flower of hibiscus 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.200
 very nice and it pleases people with 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.740
 these utilitarian plants place arts 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.360
 in general 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.150
 finally there is also that which likes a lot 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.950
 it's rice 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.010
 hello arrange people know 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.520
 pretty little laughing plan and that's them 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.520
 Interested a lot 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.510
 ayala victoria also you see that you 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.910
 shoots well that grows well a little 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.590
 late this year but I have good 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.210
 hope to have beautiful trays from here 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.200
 some times and flowers maybe 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:51.730
 flowers but I hope so and the 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.970
 vanilla too it's true it's pretty 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.970
 still 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.860
 and then a lot of favorite areas he me 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.100
 seems yeah when there is sun it's 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.590
 really nice we see through the 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.900
 insects through the traps he 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.010
 begins to eat well 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.110
 look at this one he's started to 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.770
 to make indigestion 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.520
 I think it will be full of insects 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:23.990
 oh boy toy have a little bit good it's 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.990
 not very ragoÃ»tant all that same 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:32.729
 ah yeah to his features of the nuts 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.660
 well we'll go over there because 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.660
 the smell is still not terrible 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.229
 otherwise I was looking at the 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.350
 dragon tree of the canaries with its sap 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.940
 we call the blood of the dragon 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.680
 that's when we harvest one of these 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.020
 four I think it could be 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.940
 preserved to show yes I think 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.520
 yes but since it must be used in 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:02.789
 throwing one would like it seems everything to 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.039
 the time we could see what the 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.750
 diversity plant biodiversity have 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.919
 so could also see the different 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.720
 missions of a botanical garden 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.370
 it still remains it was only a glimpse 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.599
 so there is still a lot of things to 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.130
 see in this garden of plants 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.870
 now we have to go back to any 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.070
 what time of the year and we will be 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.570
 always happy to welcome the public 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.570
 to show you all that
