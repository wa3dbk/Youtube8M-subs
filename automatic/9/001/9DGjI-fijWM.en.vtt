hello YouTube has a little update on my

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.570 
hello YouTube has a little update on my
battery<00:00:05.330> shelf<00:00:06.770> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> beginning

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
battery shelf this is at the beginning

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
battery shelf this is at the beginning
of<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:12.980> built<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.820> hold<00:00:14.849> quite<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> bit<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
of it built it to hold quite a bit of a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.170 
of it built it to hold quite a bit of a
few<00:00:17.130> batters<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.490> lot<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.789> stuff<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> I

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
few batters a lot of the stuff that I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
few batters a lot of the stuff that I
have<00:00:18.390> kicking<00:00:18.720> around<00:00:18.779> beside<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.350> is

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
have kicking around beside it is

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
have kicking around beside it is
definitely<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
definitely going it's all going to be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.009 
definitely going it's all going to be
cleared<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:22.970> nice<00:00:23.970> little<00:00:24.210> spot<00:00:24.390> above<00:00:24.660> there

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
cleared out nice little spot above there

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
cleared out nice little spot above there
and<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:26.330> panels<00:00:27.330> above<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:28.070> but<00:00:29.070> i'm

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and then my panels above that but i'm

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.919 
and then my panels above that but i'm
going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> set<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> solar<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
going to set up all the solar and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.490 
going to set up all the solar and
hopefully<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> future<00:00:32.219> wind<00:00:33.230> right<00:00:34.230> along

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
hopefully in the future wind right along

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.090 
hopefully in the future wind right along
the<00:00:34.649> wall<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.550> i'll<00:00:35.610> put<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.880> inverters

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
the wall there so i'll put my inverters

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.930 
the wall there so i'll put my inverters
such<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.340> above<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> i<00:00:39.379> also<00:00:40.379> found<00:00:40.940> some

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
such right above it i also found some

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
such right above it i also found some
wire<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.719> 10<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:51.590> water<00:00:52.590> resistant

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wire here so it's 10 for water resistant

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.389 
wire here so it's 10 for water resistant
you<00:00:55.879> yeah<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> resistant<00:00:57.570> 800<00:00:57.989> watt<00:00:58.399> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you yeah what a resistant 800 watt so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.959 
you yeah what a resistant 800 watt so
that<00:00:59.670> should<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.320> plenty<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.649> me<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> come

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that should be plenty for me to come

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.120 
that should be plenty for me to come
down<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.390> solar<00:01:03.690> panels<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:06.830> then<00:01:07.830> charged

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
down from solar panels and then charged

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.760 
down from solar panels and then charged
up<00:01:08.340> these<00:01:08.490> batteries<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.619> have

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
up these batteries so right now I have

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
up these batteries so right now I have
for<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.369> got<00:01:11.670> another<00:01:11.850> four<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> put

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for them there got another four to put

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
for them there got another four to put
on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> top<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> you're<00:01:14.189> looking<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
on the top and you're looking at with

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.149 
on the top and you're looking at with
both<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.350> 800<00:01:16.770> pounds<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
both of them that's 800 pounds of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.960 
both of them that's 800 pounds of
battery<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:18.650> know<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.580> pretty

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
battery I know it's not a very pretty

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
battery I know it's not a very pretty
shelf<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:23.119> it'll<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.240> job<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.350> not

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
shelf but it'll do the job and I'm not

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.760 
shelf but it'll do the job and I'm not
going<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.979> pretty<00:01:26.159> here

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.620 

right<00:01:31.460> here's<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.789> two<00:01:32.060> bus<00:01:32.630> bars<00:01:34.329> so<00:01:35.329> this<00:01:35.509> is

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
right here's the two bus bars so this is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.569 
right here's the two bus bars so this is
my<00:01:35.869> before<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:36.590> drove<00:01:36.799> all<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> whole<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:37.549> that

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
my before I drove all the whole so that

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.730 
my before I drove all the whole so that
I<00:01:37.729> can<00:01:37.789> attach<00:01:38.350> into<00:01:39.350> each<00:01:39.439> one<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
I can attach into each one of the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.050 
I can attach into each one of the
batteries<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.539> end<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.070> put<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.280> post<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
batteries and on the end I put a post so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.090 
batteries and on the end I put a post so
i<00:01:44.149> can<00:01:44.299> tie<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.780> into<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.549> church<00:01:46.549> controllers

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
i can tie it into the church controllers

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.940 
i can tie it into the church controllers
now<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:50.569> was<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.929> before<00:01:51.289> this<00:01:51.679> is<00:01:51.799> what

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
now that was the before this is what

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.160 
now that was the before this is what
it's<00:01:52.039> going<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.189> look<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:52.340> after<00:01:53.140> what<00:01:54.140> i

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
it's going to look like after what i

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.630 
it's going to look like after what i
wanted<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.530> make<00:01:54.619> sure<00:01:54.679> of<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.189> set<00:01:55.429> if

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
wanted to make sure of the set if

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.279 
wanted to make sure of the set if
anything<00:01:56.000> did<00:01:56.179> fall<00:01:56.450> across<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.899> batteries

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
anything did fall across the batteries

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.350 
anything did fall across the batteries
they're<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.250> going<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.429> short<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.060> i<00:01:59.119> put

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
they're not going to short it so i put

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.590 
they're not going to short it so i put
some<00:01:59.509> electrical<00:01:59.959> tape<00:01:59.990> across<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:02.329> reduce

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
some electrical tape across to reduce

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.289 
some electrical tape across to reduce
the<00:02:02.780> surface<00:02:02.929> area<00:02:03.439> that<00:02:03.619> could<00:02:03.799> conduct<00:02:04.299> one

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
the surface area that could conduct one

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.550 
the surface area that could conduct one
thing<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.509> did<00:02:05.689> notice<00:02:05.720> these<00:02:06.079> are<00:02:06.229> aluminum

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
thing I did notice these are aluminum

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.039 
thing I did notice these are aluminum
bars<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.329> I<00:02:08.329> did<00:02:08.539> notice<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:08.929> was<00:02:08.989> a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
bars and I did notice there was a

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.440 
bars and I did notice there was a
coating<00:02:09.470> on<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.950> took<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.610> multimeter<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
coating on them I took a multimeter and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.559 
coating on them I took a multimeter and
just<00:02:11.959> tried<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.170> meet<00:02:12.410> her<00:02:12.500> everything<00:02:12.829> out<00:02:12.980> I

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
just tried to meet her everything out I

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.699 
just tried to meet her everything out I
noticed<00:02:14.569> through<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> holes<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.319> was<00:02:15.440> getting

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
noticed through the holes I was getting

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.960 
noticed through the holes I was getting
a<00:02:15.799> good<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.390> good<00:02:17.390> greeting<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.670> from<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> top

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
a good a good greeting but from the top

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.640 
a good a good greeting but from the top
of<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.150> bar<00:02:21.910> back<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.299> hear<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.049> just<00:02:24.260> wasn't

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
of the bar back to hear it just wasn't

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.860 
of the bar back to hear it just wasn't
reading<00:02:24.769> because<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.250> coating<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.510> get<00:02:26.810> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
reading because the coating so to get a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.740 
reading because the coating so to get a
good<00:02:27.140> connection<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> battery<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:28.750> scuffed

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
good connection on the battery I scuffed

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.920 
good connection on the battery I scuffed
it<00:02:29.840> down<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.079> bit<00:02:30.200> with<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.750> sand<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.900> down

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it down a bit with the sand it down

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.210 
it down a bit with the sand it down
ground<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.620> down<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.769> little<00:02:33.920> bit<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
ground it down a little bit with a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.650 
ground it down a little bit with a
grinder<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.900> my<00:02:36.380> next<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:36.859> I'm<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.660> take

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
grinder so my next one I'm going to take

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.910 
grinder so my next one I'm going to take
this<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:38.900> we're<00:02:39.200> up<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.410> electrical<00:02:39.680> tape

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
this one we're up the electrical tape

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.940 
this one we're up the electrical tape
around<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.639> then<00:02:41.239> it'll<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.620> time<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.829> hook

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
around it and then it'll be time to hook

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.039 
around it and then it'll be time to hook
up<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> batteries<00:02:45.819> alright<00:02:46.819> get<00:02:47.810> them<00:02:47.959> all

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
up to the batteries alright get them all

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.500 
up to the batteries alright get them all
connected<00:02:48.500> up<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> bus<00:02:48.859> bars

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.960 

I<00:02:53.650> did<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.769> out<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.159> and<00:02:55.220> step<00:02:55.459> on<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.640> Shelf

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
I did it out here and step on the Shelf

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.119 
I did it out here and step on the Shelf
because<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.330> want<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.569> do<00:02:56.689> slap<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> charger<00:02:57.980> on

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
because I want to do slap the charger on

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.199 
because I want to do slap the charger on
it<00:02:58.629> just<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.750> see<00:03:00.049> if<00:03:00.319> I<00:03:00.409> can<00:03:00.909> bring<00:03:01.909> them<00:03:02.090> up

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
it just to see if I can bring them up

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.619 
it just to see if I can bring them up
over<00:03:02.540> twelve<00:03:02.959> point<00:03:03.170> nine<00:03:03.319> volts<00:03:06.519> percentage

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
over twelve point nine volts percentage

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:15.250 
over twelve point nine volts percentage
st.<00:03:08.629> sixty<00:03:08.930> percent<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.750> what<00:03:14.750> these<00:03:14.900> church

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
st. sixty percent so what these church

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.050 
st. sixty percent so what these church
for<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> bit<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.799> this<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.909> make<00:03:17.030> sure

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
for a bit like this just to make sure

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.110 
for a bit like this just to make sure
everything's<00:03:17.480> okay<00:03:17.780> before<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.230> stick

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
everything's okay before it's stick

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.280 
everything's okay before it's stick
everything<00:03:20.120> up<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.569> shelf<00:03:20.780> it'll<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.260> a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
everything up on the shelf it'll be a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.550 
everything up on the shelf it'll be a
little<00:03:21.440> harder<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.829> get<00:03:21.950> at<00:03:23.260> that's<00:03:24.260> gonna<00:03:24.409> be

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
little harder to get at that's gonna be

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.349 
little harder to get at that's gonna be
about<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.859> for<00:03:25.099> tonight<00:03:25.340> there's<00:03:26.030> gonna<00:03:26.090> watch

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
about it for tonight there's gonna watch

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.150 
about it for tonight there's gonna watch
this<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:26.870> see<00:03:26.959> what<00:03:26.989> happens

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.450 

so<00:03:32.820> we're<00:03:33.000> sitting<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.300> 14-point<00:03:33.960> 24<00:03:34.650> volts

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:50.800 

nothing's<00:03:41.460> huh<00:03:45.890> check<00:03:46.890> with<00:03:47.040> my<00:03:47.220> multimeter

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.700 

mostly<00:03:51.810> they<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.170> adjust<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.560> other

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
mostly they have to adjust the other

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.110 
mostly they have to adjust the other
meter<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.040> bit<00:03:55.070> so<00:03:56.070> never<00:03:56.310> dream<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.670> little<00:03:56.850> high

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
meter a bit so never dream a little high

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.600 
meter a bit so never dream a little high
14<00:03:58.220> 14<00:03:59.220> point<00:03:59.460> 24<00:03:59.970> volts<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:02.190> multimeter

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
14 14 point 24 volts the multimeter

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.860 
14 14 point 24 volts the multimeter
itself<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.950> 406<00:04:08.150> on<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.270> back<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:09.660> meter

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
itself is 406 on the back of this meter

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.140 
itself is 406 on the back of this meter
this<00:04:10.080> little<00:04:10.410> adjustment<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.160> set<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
this little adjustment to set the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.449 
this little adjustment to set the
voltage<00:04:12.300> properly<00:04:15.890> multimeter<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
voltage properly multimeter that is the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.850 
voltage properly multimeter that is the
correct<00:04:17.670> voltage<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:21.290> we'll<00:04:22.290> just<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.620> down

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
correct voltage so we'll just that down

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.310 
correct voltage so we'll just that down
a<00:04:22.890> little<00:04:23.040> bit
