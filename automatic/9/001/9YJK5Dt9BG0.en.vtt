00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.050
 you know what that balloon toy is called 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 snow and they invented them in france ago 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.010
 long you like yourself make your own 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 The first thing is that you get a bottle 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.099
 of glass and what he wants is to put 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.610
 inside that obviously must fit 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.380
 comfortably 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.600
 and it must be in addition to rubber or a 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.320
 material that does not deteriorate under the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.320
 that water is beautiful and it's chile 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.420
 but as the bottle will carry water the lid 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.700
 it must be well sealed for that you must 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 cut a circumference of cork from 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.350
 same diameter of the lid 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.560
 because cork because this type of wood 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.370
 has the ability to absorb liquid 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.170
 swell and then not to let more 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.170
 that's why they use it in wine bottles 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.620
 stick the cork sheet with silicone 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.620
 neutral 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.600
 stick the penguin from the legs to the top 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.480
 using the same silicone the silicone 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 It works very well but you should wait 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.470
 that is well dry 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.790
 now we have to fill our balloon with 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.650
 water but it must be distilled since 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.170
 do not contain mineral residues nor 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.000
 organic will not generate fungi or 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 will cloud 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 and now use one of the most 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.350
 important particles that float 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.510
 There are several options but we do it with 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 frost of this that is used for 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.770
 plastic art works 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 you should not put too much because the effect 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.340
 it can be lost now it closes wind 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.340
 snow globe 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.540
 turn around shake it and you already have your 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.510
 humboldt penguin in its habitat 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.510
 south pole now to wear t
