00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
think that this part of the competition

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.860 
think that this part of the competition
is<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.319> tie<00:04:09.709> between<00:04:09.739> ER<00:04:10.400> Pomeranian<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
is a tie between ER Pomeranian and the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.170 
is a tie between ER Pomeranian and the
poodle<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.189> write<00:04:13.370> down<00:04:13.609> what<00:04:13.909> you
