00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
 we are not so good in this video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.779
 of big fools 5 online I'm going to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
 teach a secret a reference and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.440
 they know something is making a heat is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.120
 very hot, I heard that in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 alaska were three degrees then I 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.439
 I think it would be a good idea to leave 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 alaska I do not think it's a good place yeah 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.550
 good if in the place where you live 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.080
 it's hot I think it would be viable if it does 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 frigio then not but here I am 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.750
 melting but good in this video 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 while I climb this crane I'm going to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 teach a secret or a reference 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.579
 about captain america good rather 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 on the shield of the captain america like 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 you know the shield is the most emblematic 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.460
 of the captain america although I said 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 many times captain america and I finish it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 to say again 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.760
 good is this this shield that is like this 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 represented right now they will see it but 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.149
 good to get to this location 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 we have to open our map and we 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 can say exactly the location of the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 Captain America 's shield where 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.610
 hides the captain who is exactly 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.720
 there you can see on the map 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.460
 dream on the map see it there are we 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.620
 let's go there so since what 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.150
 visualized and since they did all of that 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.880
 and since they are up a crane 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.500
 where they can be killed easily 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.400
 we reviewed several things there and then we 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 We're going over there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 and well then since we arrived we are going to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.830
 find with this building that says 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.710
 as you can see there is an eagle as you know 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 also the eagle is this very important 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.220
 in the captain america as are his helmet 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.170
 has that little room you can see 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.300
 captain's screen estimate 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.110
 america completely muscular and 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.910
 Drawn detailed with shadows and a good 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 color a good use of perspective 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.580
 because good 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 good since we are here we have to 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.430
 run exactly like I'm doing 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.990
 It depends on where you are in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.940
 come unimportant good see you go 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.180
 to find with this source not with that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.460
 eagle and the eagle is how good it is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.200
 well as the case will come and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 here you can see this eagle standing on 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.780
 the world and here they will see how the source 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.880
 is this is the same is not practically 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.310
 just as they have the image how are you 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.310
 stripes this good is like the flag 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.680
 obviously, but as you can see they are 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.690
 these kings as well as red and white 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 as in circulars and are these 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.110
 five-pointed stars that is like the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.239
 that the American captain has in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.860
 center of your shield and well then here 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.710
 is this eagle with 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.900
 in the second the capitan america takes out 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.080
 as the defender of the world and all that is 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.800
 of those theories that come out here in the USA in 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.570
 the actions of a 100% superhero 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.320
 American so blue like that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.150
 completely and well as you know or 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.670
 said if you see this source a great 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.830
 effect they know how it looks that gives you how 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.530
 an effect like movement there as not 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.860
 it looks weird cbs sees very very very intense 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.660
 very interesting and then nothing now 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.430
 captain america is doing very 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.980
 popular does not just leave the movie 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.570
 is from the captain america the soldier 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.030
 of winter the truth should see it 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.670
 because she is very careful I went to see her and 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.390
 if it is very well made when using the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.220
 ships more than that the ships as as 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.370
 they mixed there their effects are not due 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.130
 selling it is awesome I liked it better and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.200
 is much better than 1 but as 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.630
 you know the captain america movie the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.880
 still did not come out in 2011 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.610
 gta good came out two years later not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.400
 it came out in 2013 then like that it 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.100
 I could appreciate a little maybe yes 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.050
 be like the shield you do not know that ugt 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.870
 as well as a game that encompasses many things 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.340
 from the USA and this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.320
 Well, a beauty and the captain 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.300
 america so then there is the shield 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.760
 knows more or less how to give me to do 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.780
 lines your heart because I have to do 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.940
 the american to use the weapons 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.500
 but well it would be all tell me 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.350
 could fit this shield of the captain america 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.690
 what do you think about them? 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.220
 has a movie that waves where with its 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.990
 life that they have made that breakfast that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.160
 they ate that they dined all and that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.960
 comment on the real is true nothing but 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.430
 good was this spice I hope everything 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.920
 you liked grass but this video and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.370
 until next time 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.370
 Captain's orders
