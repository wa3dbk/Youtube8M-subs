00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.920
 with this 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.240
 good 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.689
 hello I'm pepe you read these with many 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.310
 questions about what is the weight 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.879
 appropriate for the amount of 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.970
 repetitions to define or to remove 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.870
 volume I want to notice that the weights are 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.120
 negative according to your privileges there are people 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.940
 that with only one girl dumbbell 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.519
 they can work a very hard and another 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.100
 much bigger formed person works 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.030
 with the same reaction according to capacity 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.600
 of muscle tissue but really 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.299
 what will define your muscles 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.909
 one part only in the amount of 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.220
 repetitions or the weight will decide your 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.210
 feeding 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.860
 your supplementation introduce that for 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 see the necessary weight there are repetitions 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 as 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.700
 sorry 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.000
 you can 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.649
 to have a little more weight 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.200
 to better stimulate the muscle so that 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.899
 can grow but as we said what is going 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.110
 to define truly is your 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.799
 supplementation feeding and the case the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 amount of repetitions is relative I 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 I can express 11 from 10 2 until 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 the muscle gets used if I am already 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.210
 intermediate level I thing that's why many 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.869
 other forms of second supplementation 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.330
 to be able to stimulate more of the muscle if 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.819
 I am a beginner first with his part 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.370
 to the movement before thinking about 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.920
 volumes or definition first in 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.610
 correct the movement in which he had that 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 custom to later stimulate it 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.819
 not all muscles react the same 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 not the entire muscular system every person 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.790
 is that it is the same there are people who are 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.010
 nature of very large legs are of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.190
 another way there are people who are from 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.260
 other members have to work another 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.690
 type of exercise to round the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.060
 oven and juan work the muscle 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.310
 there are people who by nature 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.700
 arm is very small then they have with 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.380
 be stimulate more sad that is more 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.840
 important that vice what it does 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.600
 big mind one arm more services 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.420
 the muscles greater than the vice but as 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.730
 I tell you it depends on the exercise I can 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.230
 to work 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 sometimes with an example with 15 kilos 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.019
 morgado and can vibrate work 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.670
 greatly a person can work it 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.849
 with many unable kilos of improvement are 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.000
 friends is for the muscle tissue that 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.400
 way this remember the weights where 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.370
 you finish your periodically but what 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.920
 they are going to stay in training I go back to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.310
 repeat is the feeding the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.310
 fermentation and the scarce the pcl with you
