00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 1 took today, I'm doing my own again 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.469
 video to the kita pure and it turns 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.259
 today all about high heels and now 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.750
 you think higher but why does that mean ? 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 water then to one at a high yield 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 borrow high heels 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.340
 because now so old, it is less about 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.430
 the neck around what's here with us 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 I know the causes and to meet 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.109
 I know that many of you do the same 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.040
 Knowing more is about being yourself 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.850
 bought a new shoe has units 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 or 1 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.430
 such a shoot that no heel shoes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 red 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.120
 And no matter which shapes he has 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 now closed or if it is a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 beep if it's a sandal with 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.949
 Wedge heel is if it is a new shoe 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 is and you have bad luck then pushes 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.030
 Shoe goes around this baby me 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 are the hansaplast food expert 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.850
 pressure stop and blister plaster it works 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.799
 So I'm not sure about bubbles 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.250
 there are bubbles and the bubble will 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:18.119
 quickly to a bloody shred of the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.030
 Heel and the joke with these things 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.130
 here it is a transparent one 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 protective pad is the first looks 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 times that are relatively unspectacular 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 just two so strips and the good 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 this is you can do that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 cut to size yourself 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.799
 cut to the handle the biggest one 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.710
 you need 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.790
 I mean that 's the sour one often 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.799
 does not need much better 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.600
 in fact, only this one place is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.820
 is it really cuts going on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 They are stuck around a small corner 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.009
 the cuckold is the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 transparent and you do not see it either 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.340
 or back here and then you can already 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.899
 avoid it at all 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.259
 bubble comes when the pressure is already 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.810
 was sucked and you were not clever 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.610
 enough to prepare 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 then of course you need something 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.830
 Immediately helps in this case while 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.599
 that now gives this blister plaster 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.860
 It also believes in different sizes 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.540
 from small to big 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.400
 These are so small now and yes they are 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.540
 so small bubbles firm come here 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.250
 also directly in such a small one 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 decorate cottage 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.459
 You can actually do that in every one 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.180
 Tiny evening of bag with 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.340
 cramming 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.459
 as a sportsman briefly announce that it 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.530
 These little helpers are there and you 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.780
 does not have to wait until the bubble is created 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 then a blister plaster on it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.220
 but you can do something directly 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.959
 to prevent that from happening 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.150
 and then you can really 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.760
 Put on every nice shoes you can 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.700
 How many times does one like to try shoes? 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.230
 and thinks that is totally uncomfortable and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.670
 then you do not buy it and then you buy 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.109
 Maybe you are more comfortable 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.120
 model but not quite so good 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.609
 So I'll buy then 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.930
 rather, the same model and sticking to 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:14.079
 so many protective pads of the david remes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.320

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.380

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.500
