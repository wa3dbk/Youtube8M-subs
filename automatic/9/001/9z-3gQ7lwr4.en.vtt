00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
if you keep standing where they're close

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.300 
if you keep standing where they're close
to<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> edge<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.410> your<00:02:08.560> papers<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> edge

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
to the edge and your papers on the edge

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.729 
to the edge and your papers on the edge
at<00:02:09.489> all<00:02:09.840> smell<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.929> right<00:02:10.959> through<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.470> edge

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
at all smell it right through that edge

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:21.050 
at all smell it right through that edge
before<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.220> know<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:32.020 

that's<00:02:21.690> good<00:02:21.959> there

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.110 

so<00:02:32.570> when<00:02:32.990> you're<00:02:33.110> done<00:02:33.290> it'll<00:02:33.740> have<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.120> dull

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so when you're done it'll have a dull

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.530 
so when you're done it'll have a dull
hazy<00:02:35.420> look<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.260> that's<00:02:36.590> normal<00:02:37.330> if<00:02:38.330> we

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
hazy look to it so that's normal if we

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.810 
hazy look to it so that's normal if we
