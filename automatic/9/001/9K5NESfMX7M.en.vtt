00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a style like and all of a sudden it can

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
a style like and all of a sudden it can
go<00:01:22.950> long<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.509> add

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
