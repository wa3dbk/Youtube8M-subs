00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
how to build a Lego slide to be able the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.310 
how to build a Lego slide to be able the
first<00:00:08.099> half<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> slide<00:00:09.050> you<00:00:10.050> will<00:00:10.110> need

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
first half of the slide you will need

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
first half of the slide you will need
these<00:00:10.590> pieces<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.940> pause<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> video

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
these pieces and you can pause the video

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
these pieces and you can pause the video
now<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.929> collect<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:15.230> so<00:00:16.230> once<00:00:17.070> you've<00:00:17.220> got

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now to collect them so once you've got

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.849 
now to collect them so once you've got
the<00:00:17.490> pieces<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.660> start<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.140> by<00:00:19.320> taking<00:00:19.560> your

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the pieces you start off by taking your

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.400 
the pieces you start off by taking your
2<00:00:20.130> by<00:00:20.310> 6<00:00:20.550> plates<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:22.670> your<00:00:23.670> 5<00:00:24.090> grille<00:00:24.810> pieces

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
2 by 6 plates and your 5 grille pieces

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.210 
2 by 6 plates and your 5 grille pieces
and<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:26.430> place<00:00:26.670> them<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.060> between<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> studs

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
and just place them in between the studs

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.620 
and just place them in between the studs
and<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:31.019> over<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.619> along

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.470 

so<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.829> should<00:00:38.040> end<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.610> something

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so then you should end up with something

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.959 
so then you should end up with something
that<00:00:39.960> looks<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> ladder
