as such

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.150 
as such
you're<00:02:07.060> actually<00:02:07.330> throwing<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.890> should

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
handy about these long ropes if you've

there Cosworth about ten feet what that
does<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.720> takes<00:02:46.990> these<00:02:47.200> light<00:02:47.470> ropes<00:02:47.800> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
does is that takes these light ropes and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.940 
does is that takes these light ropes and
it<00:02:48.760> lets<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.150> sail<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:50.260> weight<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.710> coal

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
it lets it sail the weight of the coal

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.630 
it lets it sail the weight of the coal
helps<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> rope<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.820> go<00:02:52.000> out<00:02:53.160> another<00:02:54.160> basic

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640

basic loops you could use to throw and
would<00:03:39.610> really<00:03:39.850> help<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.209> out<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:42.030> hope<00:03:43.030> that
