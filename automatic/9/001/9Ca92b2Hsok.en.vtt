 well welcome to this your channel 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.289
 let's talk to android today 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:09.570
 we bring a pretty videotutorial 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.209
 simple is like entering the recovery mod and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.589
 by giving us mold in this galaxy days like this 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.589
 that do not move we begin 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.810
 well let's start this tutorial with what 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 What is the recovery mode and what is it used for? 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.160
 the recovery mud that this phone has 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 is the factory is not modified is not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.790
 a clone wormald this one just 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 can serve to make a white 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.220
 complete to our phone in any case 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 that we have lost the password or the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.210
 google account this is going to serve us and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.430
 how are we going to access it, it's very easy 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.200
 let's do a combination of keys 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.400
 what is home 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.400
 but at the same time 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 we're going to leave it down until 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.920
 look in the world recovery 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 and well this is the recovery I'm going to 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.450
 explain a little bit what it is for 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.579
 thing the first option is to rebound 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 the system the second we can 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.420
 select by moving these keys 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.450
 volume up volume down we can 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 move the second that beach update 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.579
 from stewart are for example 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.700
 to be able to apply the zip of the rut 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.030
 for this phone 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.939
 The white data tractor and bizet is the one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.240
 I told them to make this Uruguay 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.729
 total here we give in the home button and 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 shows us in this little screen here 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.070
 we have to give it to him and let him 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.450
 make the wipe 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.549
 and we are going to give us here 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 let's go back to us and the one that follows is 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.179
 cool cachet partition this also we 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 it can serve at some time when 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.750
 to install some room reboot system or 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.959
 to provoke the system and take us out 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.959
 from there 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
 and well the next one is the montt lounge 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.540
 which is the simplest for what is the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.120
 of anÃ³n mode this mode serves to be able to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.430
 flashing some rest that in our 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.160
 phone in case we did a bad flash or 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.630
 if we want to install a stock for 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.440
 take it to guarantees and we have 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.840
 modified this way they will hear it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.780
 a lot out there that is the damage and how is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 that is accessed to remove the battery for 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 make it a little faster 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 or what is a combination of keys 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.510
 also that is volume down home and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.510
 power at the same time 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.010
