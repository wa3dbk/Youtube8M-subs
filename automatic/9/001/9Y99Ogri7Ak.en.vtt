anything<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.640> piece<00:01:06.880> weighs<00:01:07.119> cost

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
anything because this piece weighs cost

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.410 
anything because this piece weighs cost
a<00:01:08.140> half<00:01:08.289> million<00:01:08.560> dollars<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.119> big<00:01:10.270> old

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
a half million dollars it's a big old

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.779 
a half million dollars it's a big old
generator<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.229> we've<00:01:11.560> got<00:01:11.770> everything<00:01:11.979> pretty

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
generator so we've got everything pretty

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.760 
generator so we've got everything pretty
tight<00:01:13.090> pretty<00:01:13.119> squared<00:01:13.780> away<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:15.179> I<00:01:16.770> just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
tight pretty squared away and I just

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.540 
tight pretty squared away and I just
wanted<00:01:17.950> simple<00:01:18.550> short<00:01:19.619> connections<00:01:20.619> but<00:01:21.369> he

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
wanted simple short connections but he

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.749 
wanted simple short connections but he
loaded<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:22.060> up<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.659> I<00:01:23.050> tied<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.560> down<00:01:23.740> now<00:01:24.580> on

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
loaded that up and I tied it down now on

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.600 
loaded that up and I tied it down now on
this<00:01:24.970> fuel<00:01:25.509> tank<00:01:27.090> four<00:01:28.090> factors<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.960> tank

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
this fuel tank four factors on the tank

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.340 
this fuel tank four factors on the tank
not<00:01:30.610> required<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.210> display<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.810> vehicle

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
not required and display on the vehicle

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.160 
not required and display on the vehicle
that's<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.069> way<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.280> was<00:01:33.429> working<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.240> i<00:01:34.479> just

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that's the way it was working so i just

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.719 
that's the way it was working so i just
did<00:01:35.319> a<00:01:35.429> container<00:01:36.429> lock<00:01:36.729> on<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.030> too<00:01:38.729> style

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
did a container lock on that too style

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.779 
did a container lock on that too style
of<00:01:40.090> change<00:01:40.509> job<00:01:40.929> just<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.069> barely<00:01:42.340> put

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
of change job just it just barely put

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.100 
of change job just it just barely put
through<00:01:43.000> these<00:01:43.209> are<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.479> little<00:01:43.569> bit<00:01:43.810> smaller

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
through these are a little bit smaller

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.619 
through these are a little bit smaller
than<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.379> normal<00:01:44.410> container<00:01:45.129> but<00:01:45.369> that's<00:01:46.300> okay

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:46.629 
than a normal container but that's okay

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:48.869 
than a normal container but that's okay
it's<00:01:46.840> trapped<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.379> i<00:01:47.770> went<00:01:48.489> ahead<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.729> you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:48.879 
it's trapped it's i went ahead and you

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:52.229 
it's trapped it's i went ahead and you
went<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.300> full<00:01:50.489> gamut<00:01:51.489> on<00:01:51.819> there<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.179> just

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
went the full gamut on there and just

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.800 
went the full gamut on there and just
got<00:01:53.110> everything<00:01:53.170> tied<00:01:53.500> down<00:01:53.709> and<00:01:54.690> not<00:01:55.690> to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
got everything tied down and not to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.510 
got everything tied down and not to
worry<00:01:55.840> about<00:01:56.080> coming<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.069> last<00:01:57.160> night<00:01:57.489> I

hard<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.370> see<00:02:12.519> at<00:02:12.610> night<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.379> pretty<00:02:14.650> cool

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
hard to see at night so it's pretty cool

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.809 
hard to see at night so it's pretty cool
pretty<00:02:16.209> cool<00:02:16.390> pieces<00:02:16.870> parts

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.630 

but<00:02:24.689> it's<00:02:25.109> tighter<00:02:25.379> than<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.709> drum<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.310> mean

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
but it's tighter than a drum I mean

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.300 
but it's tighter than a drum I mean
that's<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.139> overstretch<00:02:28.680> might<00:02:28.950> change

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that's the one overstretch might change

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.449 
that's the one overstretch might change
that<00:02:29.730> that's<00:02:30.540> how<00:02:30.689> am<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.959> not<00:02:31.109> they<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.159> you
