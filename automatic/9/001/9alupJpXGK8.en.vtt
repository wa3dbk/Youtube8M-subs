coins basically what is if you want to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.140 
coins basically what is if you want to
buy<00:03:11.470> 100<00:03:12.470> k<00:03:12.709> you'll<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.700> gold<00:03:13.910> player

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
buy 100 k you'll get the gold player

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.860 
buy 100 k you'll get the gold player
which<00:03:14.359> is<00:03:14.569> minimums<00:03:15.079> 150<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.280> max<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:16.849> 5k<00:03:17.569> and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
which is minimums 150 the max is 5k and

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.099 
which is minimums 150 the max is 5k and
usually<00:03:18.440> slows<00:03:18.709> them<00:03:18.919> up<00:03:19.160> for<00:03:19.310> 5k<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:20.630> it

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
usually slows them up for 5k and then it

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.599 
usually slows them up for 5k and then it
will<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.349> take<00:03:21.440> ages<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.099> them<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.310> buy<00:03:22.489> all

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
will just take ages for them to buy all

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.370 
will just take ages for them to buy all
of<00:03:22.730> them<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.450> think<00:03:23.780> that's<00:03:24.019> one<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
of them but I think that's one of the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.870 
of them but I think that's one of the
ways<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:24.829> do<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.280> then<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.849> next

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
ways you can do it and then the next

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.220 
ways you can do it and then the next
wave<00:03:26.239> want<00:03:26.419> to<00:03:26.540> do<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:26.780> like<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> million

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230
