direction you're moving the lever just

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.390 
direction you're moving the lever just
gives<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.400> little<00:02:31.520> better<00:02:31.790> feel<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.390> that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
piston for the brake for the brakes but

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.630 
piston for the brake for the brakes but
just<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:39.260> beautiful<00:02:39.620> bike<00:02:40.070> kind<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.490> has

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
just a really beautiful bike kind of has

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.140 
just a really beautiful bike kind of has
a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:41.150> bit<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.580> gripper<00:02:43.580> kind<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.940> seat
