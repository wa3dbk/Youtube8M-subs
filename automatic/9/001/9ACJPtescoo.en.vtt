00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.740
 hi guys from youtube in this video les 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.050
 I will show how to install as 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.170
 dress it how to install textures pack 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.740
 of Minecraft 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:22.750
 the 1.7 points first we will be today 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.240
 I think if this one is not good we're going to 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.220
 give him no 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:34.190
 and they put minecraft I do not know him before 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.130
 texture that many bugs want to take 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.880
 equally textured 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.880
 and here 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.430
 I do not know if they are on a page where 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.430
 there are many studies 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.750
 good to declare a bread that texture 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 after 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.700
 suppose they always have the folders and 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.460
 I have it here 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:10.780
 if we suppose criteria dragged it here 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:13.990
 because good to squeeze viera appointed him 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 this with what they do so they do not squeeze it and 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 tighten in lerma and put percent app 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.440
 app data percent or they can also 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:30.690
 put here percent 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.720
 and good 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.070
 let's go where minecraft point and says 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.560
 let's go where it says 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.950
 resurge bausch 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:49.030
 and it's empty we drag like that in winrar 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 we close it and open in minecraft this 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 it's taken a little bit so 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.350
 where are you going to say hello to something good 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.050
 wait when the heat finishes this 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.500
 while I tell them I do not know 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.480
 the series of youtube let's say you're 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.870
 without uploading it 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.520
 of survival because we are going the guide of the 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.780
 minecraft but very guided 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.780
 and I can not 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.900
 because good I have the launcher here I 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 I did a lot a lot 2002 and here is also 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.420
 put the logo and put your name 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.480
 and they did not go to the teacher if they have 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.700
 this haul is this I love you extreme 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 Minecraft launcher 3.0 zero point 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.300
 then they are given the description in the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.640
 name I do not leave the expected because neither 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.420
 I even remember where I downloaded it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.070
 good and here they put the name they want 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.400
 to appear here and here too 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.050
 they have to put you put the version I 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.280
 in this case the us and you with all 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.620
 because I never tried with our 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.129
 versions 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.099
 and they can know profe we ​​give him play and 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.920
 we hope to remove already good I tell them 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.319
 the editor is that as it gives me very tilted 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.890
 describes many but many maps of 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.879
 adventure by luck I did not know 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.159
 download them I will invent a lot of 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.420
 things are very busy but now I do not 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.920
 I know if I isolated why 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.569
 I dont know 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.439
 and good 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.439
 let's hope 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.530
 eliminate a bunch of the same maps 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.390
 I believe but 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.550
 and eliminated from the father in texture but 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.020
 good you when you dragged on the 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.640
 good textures package 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.069
 they have it there 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.080
 what's it called and now while the crazy 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.550
 of acceptance and good 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.800
 that folder is empty they have to 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.819
 drag the file as I did before 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.650
 and it is and what it 's called and now we have 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.650
 wait for the micro to open 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.290
 and it opens 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.150
 but I'm not here this is the image that 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.139
 I would have to put in but he still did not put 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.410
 but I'm going to do it for youtube and other 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.410
 video 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:33.530
 let's go to resource table options 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.530
 we give here in exquisite and we click 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.729
 well, it's going to take a little 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.529
 well still not going to appear 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.529
 so I think so 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.370
 if it is put it is created 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.610
 they already have it in the package of things 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.440
 we go to the youtube map to see I follow 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.450
 the guide or not with this resource town 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.740
 because I used to have it but it eliminates it 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.740
 because he also came very slow 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.060
 to see if he encouraged me very fast 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.140
 nobody knows 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.140
 I charge 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.679
 it's not like it goes where it was 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.580
 much slower today but I'm just going to 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:36.580
 distinguish almost 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.490
 cross 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.339
 good 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.339
 this is all 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.150
 and good this resource project I'm going 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.870
 to play because almost nothing 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.870
 inscriptions 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.430
 the course 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:08.599
 using my resource package is normal the 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.599
 of minecraft and bolivia 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.480

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.830
 let's play 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.830
 let's see how 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.520
 good market in the difference what 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.750
 I'm going to do now is eliminate or is this 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.419
