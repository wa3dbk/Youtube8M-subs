so<00:00:08.760> flip<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> over<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.450> start<00:00:09.690> removing<00:00:09.929> all

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
so flip it over and start removing all

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.200 
so flip it over and start removing all
the<00:00:10.559> screws<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> case<00:00:11.340> oh<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.000> here's<00:00:12.150> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the screws to the case oh and here's a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.430 
the screws to the case oh and here's a
little<00:00:12.360> tip<00:00:12.480> you're<00:00:12.870> gonna<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> bunch<00:00:13.320> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
little tip you're gonna have a bunch of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.530 
little tip you're gonna have a bunch of
screws<00:00:13.710> left<00:00:13.980> over<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> magnet

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
screws left over so I just use a magnet

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
screws left over so I just use a magnet
to<00:00:15.690> scoop<00:00:15.960> them<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.560> hold<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to scoop them all up and hold them in

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.180 
to scoop them all up and hold them in
place

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
place

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
place
now<00:00:17.609> once<00:00:17.789> you've<00:00:17.910> got<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.240> open<00:00:18.390> you're

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
now once you've got that open you're

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.060 
now once you've got that open you're
going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> look<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> small<00:00:19.650> circuit

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
going to look for the small circuit

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
going to look for the small circuit
board<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> remove<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> two<00:00:21.300> screws<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.109> we

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
board and remove the two screws so we

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290 
board and remove the two screws so we
can<00:00:22.380> access<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.920> other<00:00:23.100> side<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.730> we're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
can access the other side of it we're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.060 
can access the other side of it we're
going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.570> using<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> LED<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.470> goes<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be using the LED that goes to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
going to be using the LED that goes to
the<00:00:26.189> scroll<00:00:26.580> lock<00:00:26.910> key<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.900> that's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the scroll lock key because that's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
the scroll lock key because that's
pretty<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> useless<00:00:29.189> key<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
pretty much a useless key now if you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.849 
pretty much a useless key now if you
don't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.019> also<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.470> your

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
don't have one you could also use your

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
don't have one you could also use your
number<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> desolder<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.960> LED

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
number we're going to desolder the LED

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
number we're going to desolder the LED
that<00:00:34.469> goes<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> scroll<00:00:35.430> lock<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.969> remove

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that goes to the scroll lock and remove

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
that goes to the scroll lock and remove
the<00:00:36.600> LED<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.320> hang<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.640> your

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the LED and hang on to it put it in your

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
the LED and hang on to it put it in your
parts<00:00:38.910> bin<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> perfectly<00:00:40.140> good

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
parts bin because it's a perfectly good

tubing<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.189> over<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> two<00:01:30.119> wires<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
tubing down over the two wires this just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
tubing down over the two wires this just
makes<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> finished<00:01:31.979> product<00:01:32.369> look<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> little

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
makes the finished product look a little

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
makes the finished product look a little
cleaner<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:34.079> light<00:01:34.290> source<00:01:34.530> I'm

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
cleaner and now your light source I'm

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
cleaner and now your light source I'm
using<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.610> five<00:01:36.000> millimeter<00:01:36.509> high

on<00:01:42.479> our<00:01:42.659> LEDs<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.530> added<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> small<00:01:44.280> strip<00:01:44.640> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
on our LEDs I added a small strip of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
on our LEDs I added a small strip of
electrical<00:01:45.210> tape<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.600> keep<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> connections

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
electrical tape to keep the connections

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.380 
electrical tape to keep the connections
apart<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> cover<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.329> is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
apart and to cover them up and this is

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
apart and to cover them up and this is
what<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.810> finished<00:01:48.990> illuminated<00:01:49.770> keyboard

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
what your finished illuminated keyboard

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
what your finished illuminated keyboard
should<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.570> let<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.290> be

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
should look like and now let there be

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
should look like and now let there be
light<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> bend<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> wires<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> point

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
