mighty rivers great rivers and they flow
all<00:00:10.500> year<00:00:10.800> round<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.370> they<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> source

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
all year round and they are the source

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.440 
all year round and they are the source
of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.719> water<00:00:13.259> supply<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.759> region<00:00:15.210> and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
of the water supply of that region and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.140 
of the water supply of that region and
not<00:00:15.630> much<00:00:15.870> rainfall<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:16.949> these<00:00:17.609> rivers

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
not much rainfall there but these rivers

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
not much rainfall there but these rivers
flow<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.570> there<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> freshwater

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
flow and there are a lot of freshwater

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.480 
flow and there are a lot of freshwater
then<00:00:20.750> but<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:21.960> their<00:00:22.410> source<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then but they their source is in the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
then but they their source is in the
mountains<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> north<00:00:24.480> gorgeous<00:00:25.109> Sun<00:00:25.350> and

elbows range and the Caucasus so if you
look<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> map<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> snow<00:00:34.410> topped

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
look at the map you have the snow topped

boars and then go down to Armenia and
then<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.410> Kurdistan<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> land

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
then to Kurdistan and then the land

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.970 
then to Kurdistan and then the land
lowers<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.190> Babylonia<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:49.530> the

lowers down to Babylonia so when the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
lowers down to Babylonia so when the
spring<00:00:50.660> when<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> spring<00:00:52.170> comes

spring when the spring comes
these<00:00:53.670> snows<00:00:54.030> melt<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> rivers<00:00:55.230> start<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
these snows melt and the rivers start to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.119 
these snows melt and the rivers start to
flood<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.730> come<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.210> strong<00:00:58.129> powerful

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
flood and they come down strong powerful

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.229 
flood and they come down strong powerful
surges<00:01:00.829> all<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.430> course<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:03.120> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
surges all of that of course can be

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
surges all of that of course can be
handled<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> expect<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
handled because you expect it then you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.060 
handled because you expect it then you
know<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> arrange<00:01:05.400> things<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.210> on

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
know how to arrange things and so on

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.469 
know how to arrange things and so on
however<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:10.130> unexpected

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
however there is also an unexpected

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.020 
however there is also an unexpected
problem<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.720> weather<00:01:13.670> there<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> factor<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
problem in weather there is a factor in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
problem in weather there is a factor in

Madagascar is desert and said that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
Madagascar is desert and said that
mountain<00:01:49.290> center<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.360> catches<00:01:51.360> the

Persian<00:02:26.739> Gulf<00:02:27.040> coming<00:02:27.549> in<00:02:27.760> as<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.360> flood

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
Persian Gulf coming in as the flood

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.420 
Persian Gulf coming in as the flood
waters<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.470> Tigris<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.860> Euphrates<00:02:29.980> are

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are
coming<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:30.989> then<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.769> great

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
coming down then you have the great

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.850 
coming down then you have the great
flood<00:02:33.370> which<00:02:33.690> has<00:02:34.690> happened<00:02:35.200> from<00:02:35.319> time<00:02:35.409> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
flood which has happened from time to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.990 
flood which has happened from time to
time<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:37.870> feeling<00:02:38.409> is<00:02:38.620> my<00:02:39.040> theory<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.640> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
time my feeling is my theory is that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.380 
time my feeling is my theory is that
after<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.500> first<00:02:41.530> cities<00:02:42.159> had<00:02:42.400> been<00:02:42.579> built<00:02:42.879> at

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
after the first cities had been built at

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.539 
after the first cities had been built at
a<00:02:44.049> certain<00:02:44.440> time<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:45.069> great<00:02:45.760> flood<00:02:46.120> came<00:02:46.510> and

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
a certain time a great flood came and

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.880 
a certain time a great flood came and
inundated<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.730> whole<00:02:48.970> area<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.709> was<00:02:50.829> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
inundated the whole area and it was a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.890 
inundated the whole area and it was a
tremendous<00:02:52.230> disaster<00:02:54.209> which<00:02:55.209> was<00:02:55.390> bad<00:02:55.599> enough

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
tremendous disaster which was bad enough

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.360 
tremendous disaster which was bad enough
of<00:02:56.290> course<00:02:56.500> I'm<00:02:56.650> sure<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.099> waters

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
of course I'm sure when the waters

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.949 
of course I'm sure when the waters
receded<00:02:57.849> they<00:02:57.970> rebuilt<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.420> cities<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.840> so

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
receded they rebuilt the cities and so

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.789 
receded they rebuilt the cities and so
on<00:02:59.079> but<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.890> memory<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.640> people<00:03:01.799> that

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
on but in the memory of the people that

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.750 
on but in the memory of the people that
flood<00:03:03.480> inundated<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> whole<00:03:04.959> world<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.760> mean

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
flood inundated the whole world I mean

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.270 
flood inundated the whole world I mean
for<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.090> practical<00:03:07.810> purposes<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.409> it<00:03:08.920> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
for all practical purposes it it it's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.880 
for all practical purposes it it it's
drowned<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.599> first<00:03:10.870> cities<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.530> were<00:03:11.709> ever

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
drowned the first cities that were ever

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.720 
drowned the first cities that were ever
built<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:13.900> enough<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.230> say<00:03:14.590> well<00:03:14.829> that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
built and that's enough to say well that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.280 
built and that's enough to say well that
great<00:03:16.090> flood<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.480> remember<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.109> though

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
great flood you remember that for though

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.569 
great flood you remember that for though
it<00:03:17.440> was<00:03:17.620> bigger<00:03:17.859> than<00:03:18.040> anything<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.489> can

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
it was bigger than anything you can

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.580 
it was bigger than anything you can
imagine<00:03:18.639> none<00:03:19.419> in<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.660> whole<00:03:19.930> world<00:03:20.169> when<00:03:20.410> did

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
imagine none in the whole world when did

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.949 
imagine none in the whole world when did
that<00:03:20.709> happen<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.790> preliterate<00:03:22.209> period<00:03:22.870> I

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that happen in the preliterate period I

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.440 
that happen in the preliterate period I
mean<00:03:23.169> before<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.650> origin<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.099> history<00:03:24.549> but

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
mean before the origin of history but

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.479 
mean before the origin of history but
the<00:03:25.599> memory<00:03:25.959> was<00:03:26.230> there<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.980> cities<00:03:27.340> were

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the memory was there and the cities were

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.550 
the memory was there and the cities were
built<00:03:27.669> before<00:03:28.209> history<00:03:28.389> began<00:03:28.840> before<00:03:29.440> they

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
built before history began before they

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.009 
built before history began before they
are<00:03:29.590> writing<00:03:30.099> was<00:03:30.760> started<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.750> have

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
are writing was started so you have

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.520 
are writing was started so you have
these<00:03:32.260> elements<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.519> into<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:34.030> whole

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
these elements that go into the whole

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.050 
these elements that go into the whole
factor<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.739> what<00:03:36.099> could<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.489> created<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
factor of what could have created the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.819 
factor of what could have created the
concept<00:03:37.419> of<00:03:37.569> flood<00:03:37.900> story<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.440> then<00:03:38.680> of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
concept of flood story and then of

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.920 
concept of flood story and then of
course<00:03:38.859> people<00:03:39.250> recorded<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.660> was<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
course people recorded it this was the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.110 
course people recorded it this was the
great<00:03:41.139> flood<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.919> Sumerians<00:03:42.519> recorded<00:03:43.000> it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
great flood the Sumerians recorded it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.270 
great flood the Sumerians recorded it
after<00:03:43.480> 3,000<00:03:44.109> BC<00:03:44.470> when<00:03:44.709> they<00:03:44.829> invented

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
after 3,000 BC when they invented

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.610 
after 3,000 BC when they invented
writing<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:46.090> Babylonians<00:03:46.810> translated<00:03:47.500> it

writing the Babylonians translated it

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.939 
writing the Babylonians translated it
and<00:03:47.799> recorded<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.790> enlarged<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.480> and

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
and recorded it and enlarged it and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.710 
and recorded it and enlarged it and
incorporated<00:03:50.949> into<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.609> other<00:03:51.849> things<00:03:52.480> such

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
incorporated into it other things such

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.069 
incorporated into it other things such
as<00:03:52.930> philosophy<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.799> science<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.609> sociology

as philosophy and science and sociology

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.659 
as philosophy and science and sociology
but<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.199> flood<00:03:56.440> story<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.949> still<00:03:57.190> there<00:03:57.489> and

covered<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.389> whole<00:04:04.540> earth<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:05.560> why<00:04:05.709> should

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
covered the whole earth so why should

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.530 
covered the whole earth so why should
the<00:04:06.069> Babylonians<00:04:06.669> store<00:04:06.940> why<00:04:07.180> should<00:04:07.419> the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
the Babylonians store why should the

Babylonia<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.760> said<00:04:13.000> was<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.329> same<00:04:13.540> thing

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
Babylonia all it said was the same thing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.140 
Babylonia all it said was the same thing
the<00:04:14.410> great<00:04:14.650> flood<00:04:14.980> came<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.340> inundated<00:04:16.120> the

the Tigris Euphrates valley that was

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.980 
the Tigris Euphrates valley that was
enough<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.550> create<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.760> sense<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.330> memory<00:04:25.570> and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
enough to create the sense of memory and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.190 
enough to create the sense of memory and
exaggeration<00:04:26.890> in<00:04:27.010> them
