00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.180
 the techno channel 01net still at the ifa 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.250
 for this 2013 edition 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.559
 so look at these printers that's good 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.480
 true that a printer is not great 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.160
 beautiful is not very design and well 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 samsung is working to change 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 all this with its printers for 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.990
 the moment these are just concepts 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.699
 looked like they are pretty 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.109
 their particularity these four 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 Saint-Prime certainly but it's also 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:32.070
 two quikstation these two concepts that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.480
 prefigures a little tomorrow's design this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.219
 that the general public will be able to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 him ie a product that at the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.590
 a printer but also a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 docking his chains as you have 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.750
 said just now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 the goal being when we come home 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 to have on a beautiful products posed 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 in his living room on which we will put 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 his phone in charge and we will be able 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 also print the photos we will have 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.969
 done in the day 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 so for now it's only a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 concept what does it mean a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 concept at samsung 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.620
 it's design style exercises 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.399
 of technology that prefigures 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.050
 tomorrow's products 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.270
 it's a product that will be very 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 certainly very very quickly in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.619
 his living room then maxim another concept 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 it's an origami printer that's in 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.560
 cardboard actually it's a printer 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.630
 that you do yourself 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 in fact we're going to build it yourself so we 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.140
 has a real involvement of the consumer 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 and we will build it and this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 printer then she is completely 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 recyclable 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 so all the cardboard that serves to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 build the printer is recyclable 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 toner and recyclables etc 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 there is a mechanical part in spite of everything 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.259
 we're not going to go up there is of course a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.580
 mechanical part for that there is this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.479
 impression concept so that the fault 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.920
 can happen in the drum and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.270
 that she come out with the impression but 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 everything else the rest of the concept 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.400
 him that it's plastic is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 completely of the cardboard we are going 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.119
 assemble same thing as just now 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 that is, you work on 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.479
 this idea if someday it is achievable 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 you will release this kind of printers 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 yes why not yes yes quite 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.119
 really works in this logic of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 planet first so the economy 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.149
 of es2 energy from the respect of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.070
 the environment 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.700
 and that's how we designed this 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.700
 printer concept 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.950
