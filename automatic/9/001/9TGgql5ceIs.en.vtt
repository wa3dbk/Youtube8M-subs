00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the goal of the calculator was to help

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.240 
the goal of the calculator was to help

the<00:00:29.699> line<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.210> intent<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> calculator<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
the line of intent so the calculator is

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.729 
the line of intent so the calculator is
simple<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:35.700> calculates<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> angle<00:00:37.079> from

the arrow to the down lane target

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.560 
the arrow to the down lane target
projects<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> line<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> pins<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.540> a

focal<00:00:42.989> point<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.440> brings<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.430> back<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.300> where

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
focal point and brings it back to where

focal point and brings it back to where
the<00:00:46.200> bowler<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.649> lay<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> ball<00:00:47.219> down

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
the bowler would lay the ball down

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
the bowler would lay the ball down
adding<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> personal<00:00:49.530> number<00:00:50.010> lay<00:00:50.789> down

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
adding the personal number lay down

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.619 
adding the personal number lay down
value<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:52.140> create<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.800> should<00:00:53.010> slide

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
value to create where they should slide

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
value to create where they should slide
now<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.190> you're

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
now you can also use this if you're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
now you can also use this if you're
familiar<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.260> three-point<00:00:58.260> targeting<00:00:58.710> with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
familiar with three-point targeting with

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.750 
familiar with three-point targeting with
quiet<00:00:59.129> eye<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.989> break<00:01:01.710> point

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
quiet eye you can use that break point

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.660 
quiet eye you can use that break point
distance<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.390> pattern<00:01:03.809> length<00:01:04.670> for

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
distance as the pattern length for

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
distance as the pattern length for
example<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.330> 40<00:01:07.049> feet<00:01:08.840> pattern<00:01:09.840> length<00:01:09.990> -

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
example if it's 40 feet pattern length -

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130 
example if it's 40 feet pattern length -
31<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:11.280> give<00:01:11.520> us<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.820> exit<00:01:12.270> point<00:01:12.479> board<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
31 would give us an exit point board of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
31 would give us an exit point board of
board<00:01:14.100> 9<00:01:15.439> we<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.680> choose<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.280> want<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
board 9 we can choose where we want to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.719 
board 9 we can choose where we want to
play<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.330> example<00:01:18.920> 12<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.310> making<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
play for example 12 we're making a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
play for example 12 we're making a
little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> shift<00:01:21.479> off<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.960> baseline

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
little bit of a shift off the baseline

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.300 
little bit of a shift off the baseline
then<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:24.080> say<00:01:25.080> 12<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> 9<00:01:26.689> lay<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
then we make say 12 to 9 lay down is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
then we make say 12 to 9 lay down is
from<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> center<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> bowling<00:01:30.540> ball<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
from the center of the bowling ball to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
from the center of the bowling ball to
the<00:01:31.740> slide<00:01:32.009> foot<00:01:32.329> for<00:01:33.329> most<00:01:33.540> players<00:01:33.840> that's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the slide foot for most players that's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.580 
the slide foot for most players that's
five<00:01:34.500> six<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.280> seven<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.020> case<00:01:37.320> we'll

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
five six or seven so in this case we'll

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.660 
five six or seven so in this case we'll
put<00:01:37.890> six<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.920> calculate<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> line<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> this

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
put six we calculate the line so this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.149 
put six we calculate the line so this
yields<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> launch<00:01:45.119> angle<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> negative<00:01:46.710> point

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
yields a launch angle of negative point

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.899 
yields a launch angle of negative point
six<00:01:47.460> three<00:01:47.549> degrees<00:01:48.799> sliding<00:01:49.799> 20<00:01:50.250> through<00:01:50.790> the

arrow at 12 with a focal point of six

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.959 
arrow at 12 with a focal point of six
now<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> focal<00:01:56.549> point

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
now the focal point

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.840 
now the focal point
I've<00:01:57.960> included<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> application<00:01:59.159> in

40 to 43 feet so if I want to tighten up
this<00:03:07.660> line<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.400> move<00:03:09.640> inside<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:11.730> say

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
this line and as I move inside now say

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.480 
this line and as I move inside now say
at<00:03:12.910> 21<00:03:13.390> at<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.660> arrows<00:03:14.020> now<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.190> going<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> be

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
at 21 at the arrows now I'm going to be

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
11 at 43 feet so board 11 at the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.350 
11 at 43 feet so board 11 at the
intersection<00:03:20.260> at<00:03:20.440> 43<00:03:21.250> feet<00:03:21.490> so<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.180> could

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
intersection at 43 feet so I could

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.330 
intersection at 43 feet so I could
really<00:03:22.570> see<00:03:22.870> where<00:03:23.050> that<00:03:23.200> ball<00:03:23.950> if<00:03:24.190> it

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
really see where that ball if it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.660 
really see where that ball if it
actually<00:03:24.520> intersects<00:03:25.360> at<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.720> location<00:03:26.670> if

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
actually intersects at that location if

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.570 
actually intersects at that location if
I<00:03:27.790> calculate<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.570> line<00:03:28.860> 33<00:03:30.330> 21<00:03:31.330> 4<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.580> again

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
I calculate that line 33 21 4 and again

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.940 
I calculate that line 33 21 4 and again
I<00:03:33.610> get<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:33.970> intersection<00:03:34.600> now<00:03:35.110> at<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.470> center

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
I get the intersection now at the center

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.150 
I get the intersection now at the center
of<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> tendon<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.050> image<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.770> focal

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
of the tendon so this image of the focal

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.970 
of the tendon so this image of the focal
point<00:03:39.370> boards<00:03:40.360> will<00:03:40.630> help<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.170> guide<00:03:41.530> where
