00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
now I heard that the d-pad on this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
now I heard that the d-pad on this
controller<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.950> slightly<00:01:26.430> better<00:01:26.820> than<00:01:27.000> all

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
controller is slightly better than all

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
controller is slightly better than all
of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> other<00:01:27.810> d-pad<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> 360<00:01:29.640> controllers

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of the other d-pad on a 360 controllers

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.539 
of the other d-pad on a 360 controllers
so<00:01:32.210> maybe<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> will<00:01:33.540> help<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.049> bit

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
so maybe that will help a little bit

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.840 
so maybe that will help a little bit
before<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:36.000> myself<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:38.570> street<00:01:39.570> fighter

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.370 

okay<00:03:08.520> here's<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:09.300> controller<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.170> got

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
okay here's a controller that I got

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.990 
okay here's a controller that I got
maybe<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.100> two<00:03:11.280> years<00:03:11.490> ago<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.760> haven't

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
maybe like two years ago I haven't

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.080 
maybe like two years ago I haven't
really<00:03:12.270> used<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.250> guess<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.880> kind

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
really used it but I guess this one kind

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.170 
really used it but I guess this one kind
of<00:03:15.150> moves<00:03:15.360> around<00:03:15.450> too<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:17.940> feels

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
of moves around too but this one feels

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.660 
of moves around too but this one feels
way<00:03:18.570> more<00:03:18.600> loose<00:03:19.050> or<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.530> little<00:03:20.520> bit<00:03:20.640> more

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
way more loose or a little bit more

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.840 
way more loose or a little bit more
loose<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> looks<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.310> little<00:03:23.460> bit<00:03:23.700> more

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
loose and it looks a little bit more

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.570
