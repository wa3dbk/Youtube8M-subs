hello this very here again today we're
going<00:00:08.640> to<00:00:08.730> be<00:00:08.940> looking<00:00:09.059> at<00:00:09.530> vertical<00:00:10.530> dropper

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
going to be looking at vertical dropper

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.289 
going to be looking at vertical dropper
systems<00:00:12.080> now<00:00:13.400> you<00:00:14.400> may<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.669> seen<00:00:14.849> using<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
systems now you may have seen using a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.470 
systems now you may have seen using a
snapshot<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:15.990> before<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.240> been

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
snapshot video before but the have been

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.370 
snapshot video before but the have been
ways<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.960> making<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.530> faster<00:00:21.380> fortunately

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
ways of making them faster fortunately

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
ways of making them faster fortunately
they've<00:00:22.680> also<00:00:22.949> got<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.519> bit<00:00:23.730> slower

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
they've also got a little bit slower

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.120 
they've also got a little bit slower
with<00:00:24.179> the<00:00:24.210> latest<00:00:24.480> snapshot<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> I'm<00:00:26.010> just

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
with the latest snapshot so I'm just

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
with the latest snapshot so I'm just
going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> run<00:00:26.550> through<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:27.090> way<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> speed<00:00:27.630> them

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
going to run through a way to speed them

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.220 
going to run through a way to speed them
up<00:00:27.869> again<00:00:28.670> now<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.390> would<00:00:30.689> suddenly<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.050> look

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
up again now I would suddenly all look

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.610 
up again now I would suddenly all look
on<00:00:31.410> reddit<00:00:32.070> earlier<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:33.570> opposed<00:00:33.870> by<00:00:33.900> Otto

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
on reddit earlier I was opposed by Otto

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.360 
on reddit earlier I was opposed by Otto
sama<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:36.060> a<00:00:36.090> video<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.990> Nigel<00:00:37.680> form<00:00:38.100> Barry

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
sama to a video from Nigel form Barry

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.750 
sama to a video from Nigel form Barry
and<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.900> was<00:00:40.080> showing<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:41.100> particular

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and it was showing this particular

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
and it was showing this particular
arrangement<00:00:42.060> I've<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.630> come<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> top

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
arrangement I've just come up the top

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.480 
arrangement I've just come up the top
and<00:00:43.710> we'll<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.490> comparator

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
and we'll have a look so the comparator

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.120 
and we'll have a look so the comparator
at<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.880> on<00:00:48.270> subtract<00:00:48.900> mode<00:00:49.200> looping

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
at the back on subtract mode looping

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.810 
at the back on subtract mode looping
through<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.910> itself<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> setting<00:00:52.200> off<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
through into itself and setting off the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.860 
through into itself and setting off the
dispenser<00:00:54.020> now<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.980> design<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:57.450> you<00:00:57.600> notice

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
dispenser now this design if you notice

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
dispenser now this design if you notice
i<00:00:57.960> pop<00:00:58.200> then<00:00:58.550> absolutely<00:00:59.550> nothing<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
i pop then absolutely nothing is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.710 
i pop then absolutely nothing is
happening<00:01:01.790> even<00:01:02.790> though<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.060> is<00:01:03.090> happy

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
happening even though it is happy

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.529 
happening even though it is happy
flashing<00:01:04.140> away<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.549> did<00:01:05.909> work<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:10.530> at

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
flashing away this did work up to was at

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.539 
flashing away this did work up to was at

13-13 w05 a however in b is no longer
works<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.850> he<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.149> mention<00:01:21.329> a<00:01:21.570> slightly

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
works so he did mention a slightly

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.130 
works so he did mention a slightly
revised<00:01:22.320> version<00:01:23.070> which<00:01:23.429> is<00:01:23.990> increasing<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
revised version which is increasing this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.029 
revised version which is increasing this
12<00:01:25.890> free<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.749> work<00:01:31.049> just

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
12 free now doing that it does work just

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.279 
12 free now doing that it does work just
head<00:01:32.249> on<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:35.390> as<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.719> see<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
head on up here as you can see it's

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.599 
head on up here as you can see it's
really<00:01:38.780> not<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.840> fast<00:01:40.319> at<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.829> because

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
really not that fast at all because

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.300 
really not that fast at all because
these<00:01:42.149> have<00:01:42.210> had<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.990> increased<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.710> free

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
these have had to be increased to free

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.989 
these have had to be increased to free
well<00:01:47.310> let<00:01:47.939> me<00:01:47.999> just<00:01:48.229> less<00:01:49.229> emptied<00:01:49.770> again<00:01:50.759> or

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
well let me just less emptied again or

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:56.430 
well let me just less emptied again or
this<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.450> forever

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.510 

right<00:02:00.610> diamonds<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:03.100> was<00:02:04.100> playing<00:02:04.400> around

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
right diamonds but I was playing around

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.510 
right diamonds but I was playing around
with<00:02:04.910> something<00:02:05.480> actually<00:02:05.950> designed<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.100> do<00:02:07.490> a

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
with something actually designed to do a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.230 
with something actually designed to do a
two-block<00:02:08.090> hi<00:02:08.450> switch<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.430> budding<00:02:10.820> system

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
two-block hi switch so a budding system

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.990 
two-block hi switch so a budding system
and<00:02:11.950> discovered<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.310> i<00:02:13.370> could<00:02:13.850> actually

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
and discovered that i could actually

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.280 
and discovered that i could actually
adapt<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.230> work<00:02:15.530> these<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> similar<00:02:18.140> sort

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
adapt it to work these so a similar sort

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
adapt it to work these so a similar sort
of<00:02:18.470> thing<00:02:18.650> as<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.280> I've<00:02:19.670> got<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
of thing as you can see I've got the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.840 
of thing as you can see I've got the
comparator<00:02:20.450> coming<00:02:20.720> out<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:21.950> runs<00:02:22.400> into

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
comparator coming out it just runs into

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820 
comparator coming out it just runs into
the<00:02:22.880> repeater<00:02:23.300> here<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> lamp<00:02:24.650> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the repeater here just for the lamp of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.060 
the repeater here just for the lamp of
signal<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> subtract<00:02:27.260> loop<00:02:27.530> round

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
signal and then a subtract loop round

signal and then a subtract loop round
the<00:02:28.250> back<00:02:28.400> here<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.660> there<00:02:30.910> now<00:02:32.200> Alex<00:02:33.200> see

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
the back here and it there now Alex see

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.590 
the back here and it there now Alex see
we<00:02:33.560> are<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.860> fretting<00:02:34.670> w05<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.870> there<00:02:37.600> let's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
we are in fretting w05 be there let's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.130 
we are in fretting w05 be there let's
open<00:02:39.260> our<00:02:39.500> bottom<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.910> pop<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.990> men

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
open our bottom one here and pop the men

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.199 
open our bottom one here and pop the men
and<00:02:45.140> away<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.500> go<00:02:45.530> they<00:02:46.400> actually<00:02:46.520> come<00:02:46.820> out<00:02:46.850> so

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
and away we go they actually come out so

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.850 
and away we go they actually come out so
fast<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.750> some<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.050> them<00:02:48.110> actually<00:02:48.350> joined

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
fast as some of them actually joined

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.310 
fast as some of them actually joined
together<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.490> media<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.660> if<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.930> want<00:02:54.140> an

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
together in media so if you want an

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.870 
together in media so if you want an
incredibly<00:02:55.010> fast<00:02:57.160> dispenser<00:02:58.160> at<00:02:58.310> our<00:02:58.490> that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
incredibly fast dispenser at our that
