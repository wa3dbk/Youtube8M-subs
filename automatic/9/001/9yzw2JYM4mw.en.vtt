00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 Good night, the staff problem is going 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 show why Brazil needs a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.059
 constituent Assembly 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.059
 it's true 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.350
 a recent auction of the pre-salt government 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 of pt sold large oil reserve 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.970
 for companies and speculators 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970
 foreigners 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 this great fortune valued at 1 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.910
 trillion and a half dollars was delivered 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.180
 for only 15 billion 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 an insignificant part of its value 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 the great wealth of Brazilian oil 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 It needs to be fully placed 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.629
 country development service 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.370
 This requires breaking agreements and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 to be under the control of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.610
 workers and the people all oil 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.519
 Brazilian 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.420
 the clash between the huge demonstrations 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.540
 this year, and a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.210
 police and judicial system of the state 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.060
 that a true dictatorship is in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.430
 full force in Brazil we live under the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.159
 regime where protesting has become a crime 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.350
 and attitudes that challenge the streets 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.690
 the strength of the police state and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 arbitrariness of the judiciary were 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.829
 transformed into a veritable attack 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.070
 against democracy on the facade where 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:28.350
 we all already know the case of the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.630
 yellow bricklayer murdered by 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.939
 rio de janeiro military police in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 one of the times it acted 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.689
 as a squad of the death of the dictatorship 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 military 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.799
 let's see some more data only 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.469
 civil police of são paulo will cause 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 116 of the 374 people arrested in the protests 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.619
 responding to criminal cases in the river 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.450
 of January in São Paulo 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 laws against the use of masks in 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 demonstrations are being approved 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.929
 all so that the state can 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 incriminate and prosecute with 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.130
 whoever goes out on the streets and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.189
 to participate in the protest 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 and recently the state did and more 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.979
 young man closed the river street dweller 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.960
 a victim rafael vieira was sentenced to 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.900
 five years in prison in a closed regime 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.550
 believe they carry a bottle of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.790
 disinfectant because the police 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.510
 affirmed and justice accepted as being 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.510
 a Molotov cocktail 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:35.629
 it is necessary to do what the constitution of 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 88 did not do that already see the military police 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.870
 ensure the election of judges and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.799
 promoters at all levels 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.349
 by popular vote there is a plethora of 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.840
 economic and social problems who 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.129
 reveal the backwardness of the population 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 Brazilian 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.079
 one of the main examples of this is the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.930
 existence of latifundio and agreements 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.310
 monopolies 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.390
 the exploitation of our 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.159
 lands 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.889
 an agrarian reform is needed that 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:08.359
 confiscate the latifundia and distribute 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.359
 smallholder farmers 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.110
 the trial of the mensalão and the 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.060
 pt leaders without evidence 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.730
 makes it clear that despite being in the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.220
 government for ten years is not the one who dictates 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.200
 the letters of politics in Brazil in the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.269
 key issues in the country 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.670
 pt continued the policy of 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.069
 foreign banks that exploit 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.150
 national wealth on behalf of its large 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.950
 riches 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.799
 this leaves two things exceptionally 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.409
 clear that the chapter before the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.689
 right and of imperialism and that Brazil 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.639
 is not a free and sovereign country 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.859
 already what is done with its riches is 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.260
 edited from the outside and executed here 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.819
 inside it sells the right and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.889
 writing 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.290
 all of these issues that we present 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.840
 Here we show that we do not live in a 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.689
 democracy and that for Brazil 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.450
 definitively broke with the legacy of the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.849
 military regime and from years to domination 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.609
 foreign economic policy is 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.069
 reformulate and when the regime 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.379
 a true assembly 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.720
 national democratic constituency and 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.940
 sovereignty can not be driven by 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.970
 parties that have been there since the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.970
 dictatorship 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.630
 nor can be held without being 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.550
 put an end to the press monopoly 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.560
 characterized right without ending 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.290
 with the banks' control over the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.140
 national economy and without there being full 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.030
 freedom of party organization is 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.740
 need a constituent where 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.500
 social organizations are 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.050
 represented a constituent under the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.330
 direct control of the people and not 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.420
 heirs of the military regime who made 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.310
 the constitution of 88 flights and also 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.340
 Do you want to change all this? 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.150
 cool the pc 3rd party of the revolution 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.150
 socialist
