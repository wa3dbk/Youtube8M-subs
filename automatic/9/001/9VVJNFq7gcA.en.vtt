00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
about to get out with eat cuz I hate the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.449 
about to get out with eat cuz I hate the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
feeling of starving and I think it's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.640 
feeling of starving and I think it's
because<00:02:31.819> when<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.629> was<00:02:32.870> younger<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.379> in<00:02:33.500> high

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.949 
because when I was younger like in high
school<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.069> stuff<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.360> think<00:02:35.750> they

eat<00:02:36.200> lot<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.680> eat<00:02:36.830> less<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.910> know<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> get

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
eat lot to eat less you know you get

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.380 
eat lot to eat less you know you get
thinner<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:41.000> know<00:02:41.150> like

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
thinner and that's not it you know like

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.420 
thinner and that's not it you know like
you<00:02:41.959> do<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.739> start<00:02:42.920> yourself<00:02:43.310> when

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
you do that and you start yourself when

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.619 
you do that and you start yourself when
you<00:02:43.489> start<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> eat<00:02:43.910> again<00:02:44.090> you're<00:02:44.299> gonna<00:02:44.360> came
