00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.010

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.310
 metal slug collection pc collection ma 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.369
 converted mac then mac collection 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 well this is a package that 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.970
 includes all the metal slugs then from the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.220

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.280
 in short, for those unfamiliar with metal 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.230
 slug we open today wake because not 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.410
 the website exists as far as I know 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.970
 I am as if this collection includes 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.390
 metal slug ii x3 456 except metal 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.700
 slug 7xx but there are so many more there is the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.290
 art gallery from the sound gallery the options 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.890
 game and interviews and then 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.750
 well there is also the site that does not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 However, I knew in Japanese in the meantime 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.480
 here I always look at him then here he goes 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.260
 all good Japanese and metal slug 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.720
 for dinho a retro game was born or 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.400
 every sixties type where we are 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 a character who must go to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.490
 carry out various missions and survive 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.580
 against the army against the aliens e 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.400
 so for example at 3 there are mutants and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.020
 so we must survive those 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 in 2 we are underwater and so on 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.950
 I leave you the nice little choice of the day me 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 it seems therefore it is a very nice game and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.460
 they would simply be one names 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.509
 machine are therefore converted for 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.509
 computer mac 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 so this with regard to half 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.200
 saga then you open the torrent in of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.979
 put a description April will be 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.149
 always on dropbox and chile falls and you will have 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.640
 this metal slug a dmg file from 1.7 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.860
 gigabyte 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.870
 which in reality will then turn into non 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.690
 it has a lot to do with it because it's still light 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.000
 then it will turn into this or into one 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.790
 folder where inside have an image 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.690
 let's go see January 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.110
 here it is that tells us how the bee like 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.120
 you will find idm giri anyway and then dmg 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.400
 it was the torrent downloader that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 you will always have these friendships for 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.630
 as we have it and we compare 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 on corner we now have it and how it was 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.370
 just as the image described it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.989
 so pretty, and ultimately make us 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.519
 we listen to it in our folder 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.680
 applications do not copy here is here and you do 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.660
 what we will have said presses if you want then 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.430
 you can also drag it 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.890
 in the pac so as to have us together with the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.040
 other applications and then have it 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.610
 as soon as you start it you will have to use one 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.519
 phase then in this case ze shoot 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750
 hicks to jump seems to me anyway 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.600
 their exit read intertwined 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.519
 promote yourself so you can select i 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.590
 Most favorite games is playing 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.600
 directly from then this is one 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.430
 slide 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.770
 one of my favorite games 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.610
 personally it's a short video too 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.770
