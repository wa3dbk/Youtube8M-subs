00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello welcome to this video me 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.380
 would like to show how to get a t fleet 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.579
 builds and a low-flying switch means 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.599
 in the end only a signal to on 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.009
 and is exhibited 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.810
 For example, here we have a switch 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.250
 I press the button once 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.460
 and the squat goes out and then press 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.990
 I again the question goes back to 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.060
 in the end, it's nothing but 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.240
 I would turn it on but 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 this title potter is for complex of 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.080
 last and circuits necessary that 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.640
 you can store a signal permanently 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.100
 and it can and will exhibit 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.800
 and as I said, why just when it is 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.520
 also complicated and it can be quite 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.920
 easy neighbors 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.790
 in the end, you need another one 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.559
 hole where the red sox is and this 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.059
 last torch will be the signal later 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.680
 spend so we'll do it here 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.089
 line 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.210
 and here then in the end the 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:04.850
 signal come out and we put here 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.260
 make a normal best and then 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have a two big gap and here 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.500
 let's sit down and do it again 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.930
 These two trails will be available later 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.460
 push a block back and forth as well 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.370
 soon every block is fired 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 and the signal is going out of it so 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.659
 then we put two blocks over here 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.549
 Here it is where we come back in the block 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.880
 and it has to be the red dawn signal here 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.880
 hiking high 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.980
 and on the left is a last one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.980
 torch 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.840
 which leaves both perfectly active 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 and if we have a blogger now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 approaches and here the switch off 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.540
 then put this trippler switch 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.490
 actually already active the signal 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.800
 So slow is because we are one 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.800
 yes has the switch delay 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 you can either way if you like that 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.710
 you can accelerate one here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.300
 put torch here and type again here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:07.220
 a blog and thus this will be for this 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.560
 torch gets the signal immediately without 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 this blog is changed immediately so 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.230
 that title describes a bit 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.230
 goes faster 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.900
 That can also be done for specific circuits 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.970
 are necessary 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.989
 yes that had been a lot of fun with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.989
 neighbors and ciao
