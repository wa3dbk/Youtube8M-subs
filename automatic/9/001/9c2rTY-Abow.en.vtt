exactly<00:01:50.770> what<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.429> out<00:01:51.640> there<00:01:51.789> in<00:01:51.940> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
exactly what it is out there in the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.630 
exactly what it is out there in the
water<00:01:52.209> so<00:01:52.599> they're<00:01:53.259> going<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.470> be<00:01:53.590> able<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.830> see

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
water so they're going to be able to see

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.200 
water so they're going to be able to see
a<00:01:54.670> pot<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.090> bait<00:01:55.209> right<00:01:55.450> there

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
a pot of bait right there

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.030 
a pot of bait right there
so<00:01:57.080> they're<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.380> be<00:01:57.440> able<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.590> hear<00:01:57.890> it

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
so they're going to be able to hear it

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.010 
so they're going to be able to hear it
but<00:01:58.610> they<00:01:58.730> can't<00:01:58.970> tell<00:01:59.150> exactly<00:01:59.510> what<00:01:59.870> it<00:01:59.990> is

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
but they can't tell exactly what it is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.320 
but they can't tell exactly what it is
and<00:02:00.350> that's<00:02:00.440> why<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.710> top<00:02:01.100> water<00:02:01.280> like<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.700> is

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
and that's why a top water like this is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.630 
and that's why a top water like this is
a<00:02:02.390> really<00:02:02.900> good<00:02:03.080> bait<00:02:03.260> all<00:02:03.620> day<00:02:03.890> long<00:02:04.160> even

so you got to find the bait and these

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.930 
so you got to find the bait and these
little<00:02:48.140> shallow<00:02:48.350> bars<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.850> know

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
little shallow bars like this you know

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.040 
little shallow bars like this you know
to<00:02:50.630> pull<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:51.020> on<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:55.570> there's<00:02:56.570> some<00:02:56.720> good<00:02:56.840> fish

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
to pull up on and there's some good fish

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.080 
to pull up on and there's some good fish
mixed<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.470> you'll<00:02:57.680> catch<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:58.160> sizes<00:02:58.489> kind<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
mixed in you'll catch all sizes kind of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.120 
mixed in you'll catch all sizes kind of
together<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.590> know<00:03:00.680> where<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.890> caught

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
together and you know where I caught

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.259 
together and you know where I caught
that<00:03:01.250> fish<00:03:01.430> right<00:03:01.670> there

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
that fish right there

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.940 
that fish right there
not<00:03:02.480> even<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.870> mean<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.140> hardly<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.500> foot<00:03:03.769> deep

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
not even I mean it's hardly a foot deep

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860 
not even I mean it's hardly a foot deep
you<00:03:04.430> really<00:03:04.730> almost<00:03:04.910> can't<00:03:05.269> throw<00:03:05.540> anything

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
you really almost can't throw anything

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.350 
you really almost can't throw anything
else<00:03:06.200> out<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.519> other<00:03:07.519> than<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.850> top<00:03:08.060> water

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
else out there other than the top water

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.840 
else out there other than the top water
so<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.010> try<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.070> get<00:03:10.190> them<00:03:10.340> out<00:03:10.430> there<00:03:10.580> real<00:03:10.820> fast

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
so I try to get them out there real fast

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.000 
so I try to get them out there real fast
so<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.870> don't<00:03:12.140> pull<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.380> whole<00:03:12.650> school

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
so that you don't pull the whole school

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.410 
so that you don't pull the whole school
out<00:03:13.489> off<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.060> flat<00:03:15.820> take<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> long<00:03:17.120> calf

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
out off that flat take a long calf

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.180 
out off that flat take a long calf
that's<00:03:17.930> why<00:03:18.170> top<00:03:18.410> water<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:18.860> good<00:03:19.040> this

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's why top water is so good this

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.370 
that's why top water is so good this
time<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.430> year<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.930> got<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.260> have

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
time of year because you got to have

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.500 
time of year because you got to have
something<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.100> can<00:03:22.280> throw<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.790> long<00:03:23.180> ways

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
something that you can throw a long ways

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.150 
something that you can throw a long ways
I<00:03:23.660> mean<00:03:23.810> they<00:03:23.900> may<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.470> may<00:03:24.590> be<00:03:24.650> sitting<00:03:24.980> here

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
I mean they may you may be sitting here

I mean they may you may be sitting here
and<00:03:25.280> they<00:03:25.370> blow<00:03:25.549> up<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.910> know<00:03:25.970> 50<00:03:26.390> yards<00:03:26.690> away

and they blow up you know 50 yards away

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.270 
and they blow up you know 50 yards away
and<00:03:27.170> if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> bait<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.860> them<00:03:28.130> real

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
and if you can get a bait to them real

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.920 
and if you can get a bait to them real
quick<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:29.060> know<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.209> can<00:03:29.480> catch<00:03:29.630> those<00:03:29.870> fish

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
quick you know you can catch those fish

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.810 
quick you know you can catch those fish
so<00:03:31.600> I'm<00:03:32.600> running<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.930> Hydra<00:03:33.200> wave<00:03:33.380> down<00:03:34.130> on<00:03:34.730> a
