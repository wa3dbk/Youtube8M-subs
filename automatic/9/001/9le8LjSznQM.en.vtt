00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
about stripping them out good screws

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.240 
about stripping them out good screws
almost<00:00:41.260> throughout<00:00:41.560> there's<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.950> couple

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
almost throughout there's a couple

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.740 
almost throughout there's a couple
little<00:00:42.400> silver<00:00:42.730> screws<00:00:42.970> here<00:00:43.240> and<00:00:43.360> there<00:00:43.540> but

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
little silver screws here and there but

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.560 
little silver screws here and there but
in<00:00:44.200> having<00:00:44.350> problems<00:00:44.950> with<00:00:45.100> them<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:46.390> they<00:00:46.540> I

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
in having problems with them what they I

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.650 
in having problems with them what they I
did<00:00:46.930> don't<00:00:47.170> have<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.350> problem<00:00:47.650> with<00:00:47.770> on<00:00:48.610> this<00:00:49.000> GT

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
did don't have a problem with on this GT

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.340 
did don't have a problem with on this GT
is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.340> travel<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.090> my<00:00:54.720> rotor<00:00:55.720> assembly<00:00:55.900> back

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
is the travel of my rotor assembly back

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.160 
is the travel of my rotor assembly back
here<00:00:56.650> it<00:00:57.340> tended<00:00:57.790> to<00:00:57.940> be<00:00:58.180> have<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.780> ability<00:00:59.140> to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
here it tended to be have the ability to

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.560 
here it tended to be have the ability to
travel<00:00:59.590> too<00:00:59.950> far<00:00:59.980> in<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:02.070> direction<00:01:03.360> as<00:01:04.360> far

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
travel too far in that direction as far

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.069 
travel too far in that direction as far
as<00:01:04.659> towards<00:01:05.079> towards<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.740> stabilizer<00:01:06.749> in<00:01:07.749> order

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
as towards towards a stabilizer in order

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.230 
as towards towards a stabilizer in order
and<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.859> would<00:01:09.009> travel<00:01:09.249> so<00:01:09.460> far<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.999> little

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
and it would travel so far the little

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.160 
and it would travel so far the little
black<00:01:10.450> arms<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.439> it<00:01:11.619> good<00:01:12.280> luck<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.880> or<00:01:13.569> go<00:01:13.929> in

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
black arms on it good luck and or go in

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.620 
black arms on it good luck and or go in
and<00:01:14.499> get<00:01:14.740> stuck<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.399> you<00:01:15.429> can<00:01:16.270> get<00:01:16.479> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
and get stuck and you can get it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.629 
and get stuck and you can get it
couldn't<00:01:16.960> be<00:01:17.049> put<00:01:17.649> back<00:01:17.859> by<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> servo<00:01:19.389> not<00:01:20.079> good

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
couldn't be put back by a servo not good

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.690 
couldn't be put back by a servo not good
so<00:01:21.639> in<00:01:21.969> order<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.240> prevent<00:01:22.539> that<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.020> put<00:01:23.380> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so in order to prevent that I put a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.800 
so in order to prevent that I put a
plastic<00:01:24.700> washer<00:01:26.789> just<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:27.999> outside<00:01:28.030> of

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
plastic washer just to the outside of

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.649 
plastic washer just to the outside of
the<00:01:28.899> tail<00:01:29.109> of<00:01:29.139> the<00:01:29.700> cage<00:01:30.700> assembly<00:01:31.119> back<00:01:31.420> here

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
the tail of the cage assembly back here

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.370 
the tail of the cage assembly back here
and<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.950> prevents<00:01:33.280> too<00:01:34.149> much<00:01:34.359> throw<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.259> this

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
and that prevents too much throw in this

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.690 
and that prevents too much throw in this
direction<00:01:36.509> mechanically<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.490> can't

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
direction mechanically so that can't

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.039 
direction mechanically so that can't
happen<00:01:39.880> even<00:01:40.090> mechanically<00:01:40.569> in<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.749> gyro

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
happen even mechanically in the gyro

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.649 
happen even mechanically in the gyro
settings<00:01:42.039> fail<00:01:42.310> radio<00:01:42.759> settings<00:01:43.119> fail<00:01:43.359> it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
settings fail radio settings fail it

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.349 
settings fail radio settings fail it
cannot<00:01:44.319> lock<00:01:44.590> mechanically<00:01:45.159> anymore<00:01:45.670> good

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
cannot lock mechanically anymore good

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.809 
cannot lock mechanically anymore good
idea<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:46.840> my<00:01:46.990> part<00:01:50.399> another<00:01:51.399> good<00:01:51.579> thing<00:01:51.609> about

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
idea on my part another good thing about

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.440 
idea on my part another good thing about
the<00:01:52.119> GT<00:01:53.249> can't<00:01:54.249> see<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.700> video<00:01:54.999> but<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the GT can't see to this video but the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.519 
the GT can't see to this video but the
motor<00:01:56.439> mount<00:01:56.799> is<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.329> aluminum<00:01:58.329> plate<00:01:58.600> there's

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
motor mount is a aluminum plate there's

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.769 
motor mount is a aluminum plate there's
a<00:01:59.619> couple<00:01:59.770> good<00:01:59.950> things<00:02:00.159> about<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.459> one<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
a couple good things about that one the

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.649 
a couple good things about that one the
screws<00:02:02.109> are<00:02:02.139> just<00:02:03.130> long<00:02:03.549> enough<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.209> you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
screws are just long enough so that you

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.790 
screws are just long enough so that you
get<00:02:04.779> the<00:02:04.899> motor<00:02:05.109> in<00:02:05.200> place<00:02:05.849> without<00:02:06.849> a<00:02:07.029> washer

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
get the motor in place without a washer

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.760 
get the motor in place without a washer
so<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.880> at<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.330> same<00:02:10.539> scenario<00:02:11.350> with<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
so and at the same scenario with the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.050 
so and at the same scenario with the
empty<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> empty<00:02:13.330> has<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> plastic<00:02:14.280> mount

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
empty but the empty has a plastic mount

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.720 
empty but the empty has a plastic mount
and<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> try<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.830> tighten<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.250> screw<00:02:18.520> or

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and when you try to tighten the screw or

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.680 
and when you try to tighten the screw or
you're<00:02:18.880> really<00:02:19.060> getting<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.330> tight<00:02:19.510> because

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
you're really getting it tight because

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.850 
you're really getting it tight because
you're<00:02:19.810> kind<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.020> squeezing<00:02:20.560> into<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
you're kind of squeezing into the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.160 
you're kind of squeezing into the
plastic<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:22.090> gotta<00:02:22.300> count<00:02:22.720> depend<00:02:22.989> on<00:02:23.080> your

there<00:03:15.580> that's<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> had<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.140> cut<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.410> off

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
there that's because I had to cut it off

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.470 
there that's because I had to cut it off
it<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.769> not<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.980> right<00:03:21.190> link<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.970> match<00:03:22.150> up

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
it was a not the right link to match up

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.509 
it was a not the right link to match up
with<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> other<00:03:23.109> two<00:03:23.290> guides<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.100> all<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.280> did

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
with the other two guides so all I did

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.370 
with the other two guides so all I did
was<00:03:24.579> put<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> being<00:03:25.329> in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> bar<00:03:25.780> completely

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
was put a being in the bar completely

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.319 
was put a being in the bar completely
useless<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.040> was<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.910> got<00:03:28.090> cut

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
useless and it was in the way it got cut

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.349 
useless and it was in the way it got cut
off<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:30.160> GT<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:31.049> little<00:03:32.049> more<00:03:32.200> thought<00:03:32.410> into<00:03:32.470> it

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
off the GT a little more thought into it

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.509 
off the GT a little more thought into it
it's<00:03:34.359> aluminum<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.109> really<00:03:36.040> hoping<00:03:36.250> I've<00:03:36.400> got

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
it's aluminum I really hoping I've got

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.000 
it's aluminum I really hoping I've got
to<00:03:36.609> cut<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> off<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.480> guess<00:03:37.690> what<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.769> has<00:03:38.980> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
to cut it off but guess what it has a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.599 
to cut it off but guess what it has a
little<00:03:39.400> slotted<00:03:40.060> cook<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.310> does<00:03:42.489> not

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
little slotted cook so that does not

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.130 
little slotted cook so that does not
getting<00:03:42.880> away<00:03:42.940> at<00:03:43.120> all<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.390> also<00:03:43.660> looks<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.019> lot

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
getting away at all it also looks a lot

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.920 
getting away at all it also looks a lot
better<00:03:44.819> nothing<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.910> cut<00:03:46.090> off<00:03:46.239> there<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.510> we

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
better nothing to cut off there so we

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.309 
better nothing to cut off there so we
got<00:03:47.079> tighter<00:03:47.319> guides<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.180> an<00:03:49.180> aluminum<00:03:49.750> mount

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
got tighter guides and an aluminum mount

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.160 
got tighter guides and an aluminum mount
there<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.889> looks<00:03:51.069> pretty<00:03:51.250> good<00:03:52.079> nothing<00:03:53.079> to

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
there that looks pretty good nothing to

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.650 
there that looks pretty good nothing to
cut<00:03:53.380> nothing<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.920> modify<00:03:55.049> much<00:03:56.049> better<00:03:57.660> what

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
cut nothing to modify much better what

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.360 
cut nothing to modify much better what
it<00:03:58.720> comes<00:03:58.959> down<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.440> if<00:03:59.829> you<00:04:00.010> haven't<00:04:00.310> figured

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
it comes down to if you haven't figured

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.140 
it comes down to if you haven't figured
out<00:04:00.549> yet<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:02.049> three<00:04:02.889> dollars<00:04:03.040> extra<00:04:03.489> will

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
out yet this three dollars extra will

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.530 
out yet this three dollars extra will
worth<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.579> another<00:04:06.579> nothing<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.060> note<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
worth it another nothing to note is the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.930 
worth it another nothing to note is the
blade<00:04:07.959> grips<00:04:08.350> are<00:04:08.819> wider<00:04:09.819> on<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:11.609> GT<00:04:12.609> not

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
blade grips are wider on the GT not

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.879 
blade grips are wider on the GT not
necessarily<00:04:13.420> that's<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.630> better<00:04:14.290> thing<00:04:14.380> is

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
necessarily that's a better thing is

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.650 
necessarily that's a better thing is
just<00:04:15.010> something<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.400> note<00:04:15.609> i<00:04:15.850> notice<00:04:16.510> that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
just something to note i notice that

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.199 
just something to note i notice that
it's<00:04:16.780> wider<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.320> i'm<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.440> missing<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
it's wider so i'm just missing it the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.240 
it's wider so i'm just missing it the
