 LOWER LOWER TOP CAKE 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.800
 One of the most beautiful recipes that can be made with the prune of autumn plum cake 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.080
 First of all, I start by washing the plums and cutting the cores. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.640
 Cut these plum pieces with half a inch. Thickness. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 Now, I've got these prunes in a pan. 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.760
 I'm gonna add some butter and butter to it. 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.720
 The plums should still remain fresh from the oven, until they are only slightly watered, about two to three minutes. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.400
 After releasing its water, I add very little flour and let it add to the light. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.720
 In this way, we will prevent the cake from being overheated by the plum sauce. 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.360
 I mix up a little more and turn the stove off. Our top padding is ready. 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.320
 Now, let's get your cake ready. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.760
 We're gonna make a cupcake, but it's gonna make it more delicious. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.240
 I flutter until the oil and sugar in the room heat is like a bubble cream with a mixer. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 Since the kAsem is large, it is useful to sort out the oil that has run away with the spatula. 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.800
 I mix the egg and mix again with the mixer. 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.800
 I'm adding yogurdu and mixing it up. 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 In the dry materials .. 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.800
 I add flour, vanilla and trowel and add it to the mixture by eliminating it for both aeration and its good mixing. 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.280
 and mix all the materials together at low speed of the mixer. 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.120
 some of them take a crotch before the cake dough, and you're a unit of them? 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.400
 Our cake is ready in our pastry, now it is time to combine the dough with the plum. 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.960
 I'm going to set up half-plum plumes on a small baking tray with high edges 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.720
 You can also use a square or small rectangular tray if you don't have it. 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.320
 The important thing is that there are no tarts or cakes, because there is a chance that the plum water will flow. 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 You can not put plums in your knees, you can pour and spread them 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
 Something will not be lost. 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.560
 I'm trying my best to say, "Uff is hard to do," or "don't have a round oven pot." 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.240
 After pouring the delicious sauce on the plums ... 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 I put the cake dough on the groin and the lower part of the groin fruits without disturbing. 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.840
 You can spread the dough more easily with a clean spout in a light water. 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 Now I want to bake my toothpaste in 170C degree oven until the toothpaste is clean. 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:21.000
 I'm waiting for the cake to be pismis, about 10 minutes to show up in the counter and then I pass through the edges of the knife and leave. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.120
 Now we come to an important master, turn the cake upside down. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.600
 I had a little plate crisis here. I put the cake on the cake to cover the cake full and I wanted him not to open the bowl of crushing. 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.520
 that plate of this plate at the end of the classic largest glass service plate, I'm kildim .. 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 It took us a little time to leave the plums, but ... 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.080
 If you still do not put the plums in the bottom of the oven cabinet cut and place a baking paper by eliminating this risk I say. 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:17.080
 If you are not one of many calorie counters, this delicious autumn cake, which you can crown with a ball of creamy ice cream or cream, seems to be ready to be a nice friend next to coffee. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.400
