00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.089 
thing and now we're going to wire it up
i<00:04:03.480> usually<00:04:03.810> hate<00:04:03.959> using<00:04:04.260> wires<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:04.799> this<00:04:04.950> is

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
i usually hate using wires but this is

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.409 
i usually hate using wires but this is
just<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.400> show<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.639> where<00:04:05.910> all<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> wiring

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
just to show you where all the wiring

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.939 
just to show you where all the wiring
goes<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:09.180> have<00:04:09.449> a<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:10.260> our<00:04:10.440> expression

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
goes so we have a from our expression

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.559 
goes so we have a from our expression
ship<00:04:11.780> go<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> our<00:04:13.699> advanced<00:04:14.699> pod<00:04:14.940> controller<00:04:15.329> a

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
ship go to our advanced pod controller a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.839 
ship go to our advanced pod controller a
and<00:04:15.840> then<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.859> d<00:04:17.190> from<00:04:17.400> our<00:04:17.489> expression

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
and then we have d from our expression

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.879 
and then we have d from our expression
ship<00:04:17.970> go<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.150> advanced<00:04:18.630> pod<00:04:18.930> controller<00:04:19.320> d<00:04:19.650> and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
ship go to advanced pod controller d and

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.610 
ship go to advanced pod controller d and
length<00:04:20.430> from<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.060> hydraulic<00:04:21.659> goes<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.530> the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
length from the hydraulic goes to the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.100 
length from the hydraulic goes to the
expression<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.400> now<00:04:24.270> if<00:04:24.390> we<00:04:24.479> unfreeze<00:04:24.840> that

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
expression to now if we unfreeze that

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.960 
expression to now if we unfreeze that
bar<00:04:25.349> pull<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.190> chair<00:04:26.490> up<00:04:26.640> just

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
bar pull this chair up just

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.300 
bar pull this chair up just
we<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:27.210> see<00:04:27.500> look<00:04:28.500> down<00:04:28.650> at<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.860> bar<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.130> if<00:04:29.220> i

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
we can see look down at the bar and if i

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.790 
we can see look down at the bar and if i
hold<00:04:29.460> d<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.000> turns<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.750> right<00:04:30.840> if<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.590> let<00:04:31.770> go

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
hold d it turns to the right if I let go

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.710 
hold d it turns to the right if I let go
it<00:04:31.980> goes<00:04:32.250> straight<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.760> if<00:04:32.820> i<00:04:32.940> hold<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.300> it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
it goes straight and if i hold a it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.690 
it goes straight and if i hold a it
turns<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.200> left<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.950> if<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.160> let<00:04:35.280> go<00:04:35.340> go

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
turns to the left and if I let go go

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.640 
turns to the left and if I let go go
straight<00:04:36.000> all<00:04:36.180> right<00:04:36.630> there<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.020> folks<00:04:37.440> go

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
straight all right there you folks go

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.630 
straight all right there you folks go
there<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.040> your<00:04:39.530> thruster<00:04:40.530> lyst<00:04:40.740> steering<00:04:41.490> and
