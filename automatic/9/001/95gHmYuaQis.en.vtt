where it's no longer like just carpaccio

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
where it's no longer like just carpaccio
but<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.200> version<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.649> something<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.040> may<00:01:53.159> have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
but a version of something you may have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120 
but a version of something you may have
not<00:01:53.430> liked<00:01:53.880> tasted<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.689> seen<00:01:54.930> before<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.100> I

not liked tasted or seen before so I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.880 
not liked tasted or seen before so I
