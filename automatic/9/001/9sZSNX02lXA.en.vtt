collect all 16 colors of rolls and as

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.670 
collect all 16 colors of rolls and as
you<00:00:41.589> see<00:00:41.769> here<00:00:41.980> I<00:00:42.040> do<00:00:42.219> have<00:00:42.610> all<00:00:42.910> 16<00:00:43.629> colors<00:00:43.899> but

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
you see here I do have all 16 colors but

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.900 
you see here I do have all 16 colors but
I<00:00:44.710> thought<00:00:44.950> that<00:00:45.129> just<00:00:45.160> opening<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.730> chest

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
I thought that just opening the chest

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.549 
I thought that just opening the chest
and<00:00:46.149> grabbing<00:00:46.540> them<00:00:46.660> wouldn't<00:00:47.050> work<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.440> it

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
and grabbing them wouldn't work and it

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.670 
and grabbing them wouldn't work and it
was<00:00:47.829> true<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.280> did<00:00:48.489> not<00:00:48.670> work<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.629> I<00:00:49.660> took<00:00:50.379> the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
was true it did not work so I took the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.830 
was true it did not work so I took the
liberty<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:51.039> placing<00:00:51.550> them<00:00:51.910> all<00:00:52.120> right<00:00:52.450> here

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
liberty of placing them all right here

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.670 
liberty of placing them all right here
and<00:00:52.989> once<00:00:53.710> you<00:00:53.920> shear<00:00:54.730> them<00:00:54.910> all<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.379> should

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
and once you shear them all you should

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.160 
and once you shear them all you should
get<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.280> achievement<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:58.059> place<00:00:58.780> them<00:00:58.989> back
