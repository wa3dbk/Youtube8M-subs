00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
really like the packaging it looks much

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.009 
really like the packaging it looks much
more<00:00:35.129> like<00:00:35.190> professional<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.269> was<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.809> little

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
more like professional I was like little

dollar<00:00:46.109> more<00:00:46.800> expensive<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.339> it's<00:00:47.609> 549

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
dollar more expensive I think it's 549

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
dollar more expensive I think it's 549
and<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.440> regular<00:00:49.859> one<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:51.230> 429<00:00:52.230> maybe<00:00:52.499> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and the regular one is like 429 maybe I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.549 
and the regular one is like 429 maybe I
don't<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.179> that's<00:00:54.960> where<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.579 
don't know but that's where I get it
from<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.609> tried<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.079> Chi<00:00:58.379> one

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
from is that much I tried the Chi one

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.329 
from is that much I tried the Chi one
before<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.980> two

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
before and I actually have these two

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.150 
before and I actually have these two
heat<00:01:02.609> protectants<00:01:03.120> I've<00:01:03.269> used<00:01:03.570> before<00:01:04.160> along

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
heat protectants I've used before along

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.710 
heat protectants I've used before along
with<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.430> Chi<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.120> I<00:01:06.150> already<00:01:06.420> threw

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
with the Chi one but I already threw

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
with the Chi one but I already threw
that<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.620> it's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that out and I like this one a lot it's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.970 
that out and I like this one a lot it's
for<00:01:11.280> people<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> coarser<00:01:12.330> hair<00:01:12.800> but<00:01:13.800> it's

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
for people with a coarser hair but it's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.750 
for people with a coarser hair but it's
all<00:01:14.100> empty<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:15.120> was<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.440> $3<00:01:17.010> or<00:01:17.190> $4<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
all empty this was I like $3 or $4 and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.180 
all empty this was I like $3 or $4 and
think<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:19.230> then<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.800> catwalk<00:01:22.190> fashionista

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
think and then this catwalk fashionista

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.600 
think and then this catwalk fashionista
it<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:24.000> heat<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.600> iron<00:01:24.900> safe<00:01:25.260> but<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.010> don't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it does heat and iron safe but I don't

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
it does heat and iron safe but I don't
really<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.560> supposed<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
really think it's actually supposed to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
really think it's actually supposed to
be<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.130> heat<00:01:29.310> protector<00:01:29.730> because<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:30.450> tried

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
be a heat protector because I tried

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
be a heat protector because I tried
using<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.290> morning<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.000> things<00:01:33.000> did<00:01:33.180> not

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.530 

do<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> little<00:02:36.070> bit<00:02:36.190> show<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.120> guys<00:02:37.270> um<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
do a little bit show you guys um I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.410 
do a little bit show you guys um I
haven't<00:02:40.540> used<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:42.340> original<00:02:42.730> one<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.300> while

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
haven't used the original one in a while

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.460 
haven't used the original one in a while
but<00:02:43.960> I<00:02:44.380> think<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.890> smells<00:02:45.100> pretty<00:02:45.400> similar

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
but I think it smells pretty similar

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.140 
but I think it smells pretty similar
it's<00:02:47.470> probably<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.130> same<00:02:48.400> stuff<00:02:48.730> that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
it's probably just the same stuff that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.860 
it's probably just the same stuff that
you<00:02:49.480> know<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.980> hocked<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.640> dollar<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
dry cuz this is a ling is not really

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.880 
dry cuz this is a ling is not really
good<00:03:19.209> thing<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:20.230> does<00:03:20.500> smell<00:03:20.830> pretty

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
good thing it does smell pretty

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.500 
good thing it does smell pretty
professional<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.120> doesn't<00:03:22.360> have<00:03:22.480> like

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
professional and it doesn't have like

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:34.080 
professional and it doesn't have like
the<00:03:23.290> gross<00:03:23.620> zone<00:03:23.920> when<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.190> burns<00:03:32.850> okay

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
the gross zone when it burns okay

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.640 
the gross zone when it burns okay
it<00:03:34.480> actually<00:03:34.660> straightens<00:03:35.200> pretty<00:03:35.440> nicely

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it actually straightens pretty nicely

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.170 
it actually straightens pretty nicely
and<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:37.000> do<00:03:37.090> prefer<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.870> over<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.560> Qi<00:03:38.800> one

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and I do prefer this over the Qi one

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.789 
and I do prefer this over the Qi one
because<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.450> don't<00:03:41.019> really<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.500> smell

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
because I don't really like the smell

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.960 
because I don't really like the smell
that<00:03:42.100> she<00:03:42.459> has<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:44.290> doesn't<00:03:44.980> really<00:03:45.130> work

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
that she has and it doesn't really work

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.229 
that she has and it doesn't really work
I<00:03:46.140> need<00:03:47.140> much<00:03:47.350> better<00:03:47.700> than<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.820> yeah<00:03:51.820> it

I need much better than this so yeah it

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.080 
I need much better than this so yeah it
straightens<00:03:52.780> pretty<00:03:53.049> nicely<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:54.090> should

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
straightens pretty nicely I should

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.550 
straightens pretty nicely I should
