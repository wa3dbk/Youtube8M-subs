 afghanistan as a transport plane for 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 the Bundeswehr was in action at 10 59 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.009
 it then so far 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.759
 the transall c-160 appeared in the sky 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.759
 about ballenstedt 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.629
 at 9 o'clock 45 the machine of the

 Federal Armed Forces location Penzing in Bavaria 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.500
 around 11 o'clock your last flight with 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.409

 Airfield Ballinstadt to finish 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.480
 last landing on 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.270
 As you could see sat the machine 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.670
 with the chassis already before the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.500
 Runway once on a pretty 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.910
 dangerous situation from this 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.040
 view not yet fully perceived 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 could be right next to the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.220
 Einflugschneise stood on the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.140
 Public road outside the flight 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.660
 Also the audience is watching 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.700
 approach observed from their perspective 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.700
 It all looked like this 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.730
 certainly did not get built 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.640
 the chassis of 44 tons 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.980
 Transport aircraft sat on the street 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.590
 outside the flight terrain on before it 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.970
 only then stumbled on the runway 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.500
 a pretty tough situation for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.780
 the spectators among them many 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.540
 children were actually a situation 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.310
 which one could have prevented 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.870
 eleven officials of the police were ordinance 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.180
 to shut off the approach lane 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.280
 nevertheless, many onlookers arrived in 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.440
 fortunately, the area remained fortunate 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.030
 catastrophe off and transall c-160 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.650
 landed without further incidents 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.380
 safe on the floor 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.420
 the spectators liked the spectacle yes 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.230
 we have learned that here is one 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.030
 military machine 11 o'clock in the wine townspeople 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.000
 from the airfield 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.800
 she came quite promptly to their 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.780
 came a little later, the man shortly 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.890
 after 11 o'clock like trade but still over 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.970
 see our car fly 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.620
 I was still trying to take pictures 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.750
 we are here to machine times to 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.370
 we are here because we are 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.890
 My husband is interested in the former 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.650
 Parachutists and he wanted to 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.390
 again at the army 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.280
 to see such a flier 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.460
 that's why we're here we have the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.190
 time and use the time just so 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.680
 I have great to my husband 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.160
 thought if my granddaughter would like 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.230
 say that was awesome than all that 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.030
 Bundeswehr the total of over 12,000 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.350
 has completed flight hours now 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.960
 for two years here on the 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.160
 Landing lane both city ​​clubs 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.560
 before you go to the aviation museum 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.820
 wernigerode to 50 other machines 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.780
 civilian and military aviation 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.460
 comes for a ridiculous price of 30,000 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.280
 euro bought the aviation museum of the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.540
 Bundeswehr this machine off with a 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.160
 tractor became the machine to her 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.300
 new destination for the next 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.670
 pulled two years 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.320
 there had arrived the onlookers 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.870
 the possibility of the big plane 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.460
 Next to marvel near even know who 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.930
 The plane is interested here 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.490
 also visit from inside 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.320
 due to the hot situation 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.820
 Timing of the landing are currently running 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.070
 still the investigation against the 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.870
 police itself it needs to be clarified 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.490
 as it was possible that the spectators in 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.289
 reach the area of ​​the approach lane 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.699
 could 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.199
 except for this ugly aspect it was 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.220
 for many a special experience here 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.320
 to be able to be there 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.320
 when such a machine retires
