00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
simple you have this little round thing

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.050 
simple you have this little round thing
called<00:00:33.380> around<00:00:33.620> be<00:00:33.739> at<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:33.920> bottom<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.280> you

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
called around be at the bottom and you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.400 
called around be at the bottom and you
have<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:35.239> get<00:00:35.390> him<00:00:35.570> onto<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.960> metal<00:00:36.140> platform

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
have to get him onto the metal platform

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.620 
have to get him onto the metal platform
safely<00:00:37.010> without<00:00:37.070> taking<00:00:37.730> into<00:00:37.820> follows<00:00:38.450> are

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
safely without taking into follows are

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.170 
safely without taking into follows are
off<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:39.350> edges<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> platform<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:40.940> let's

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
off the edges of the platform so let's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.139 
off the edges of the platform so let's
just<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:41.539> X<00:00:41.660> your<00:00:41.780> tutorial<00:00:42.170> level<00:00:42.879> now<00:00:43.879> as

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
just like X your tutorial level now as

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.490 
just like X your tutorial level now as
you<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.329> see<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.690> have<00:00:44.840> multiple<00:00:45.019> down<00:00:45.379> these

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
you can see you have multiple down these

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.490 
you can see you have multiple down these
and<00:00:45.649> have<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.829> save<00:00:45.949> them<00:00:46.070> all<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:50.410> there<00:00:51.410> you

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
and have to save them all so there you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.160 
and have to save them all so there you
go<00:00:51.530> they're<00:00:52.129> all<00:00:52.280> on<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.789> platform<00:00:53.179> safely<00:00:53.570> so

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
go they're all on the platform safely so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.790 
go they're all on the platform safely so
I<00:00:54.199> get<00:00:54.440> three<00:00:54.559> stars<00:00:54.739> yay<00:00:56.199> as<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.289> can<00:00:57.379> see<00:00:57.589> if

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
I get three stars yay as you can see if

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.829 
I get three stars yay as you can see if
the<00:00:58.039> levels<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:58.940> guess<00:00:59.239> we'll<00:00:59.510> get<00:00:59.690> more

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
the levels I guess we'll get more

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.630 
the levels I guess we'll get more
complex<00:01:00.350> as<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.649> go<00:01:00.739> forward<00:01:00.920> at<00:01:01.280> first<00:01:01.489> I

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
complex as you go forward at first I

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.279 
complex as you go forward at first I
thought<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.059> game<00:01:02.179> was<00:01:02.359> like<00:01:02.600> ridiculously

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
thought the game was like ridiculously

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.310 
thought the game was like ridiculously
easy<00:01:03.519> but<00:01:04.519> some<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.449> next<00:01:05.840> levels<00:01:06.110> are

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
easy but some of the next levels are

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.630 
easy but some of the next levels are
extremely<00:01:07.450> frustrating<00:01:09.100> they're<00:01:10.100> one<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
extremely frustrating they're one of the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.100 
extremely frustrating they're one of the
Roundy's<00:01:10.970> fell<00:01:11.180> off<00:01:11.330> right<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:11.960> don't

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
Roundy's fell off right now so I don't

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.830 
Roundy's fell off right now so I don't
get<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.410> free<00:01:12.620> star<00:01:13.060> I'm<00:01:14.060> not<00:01:14.180> exactly<00:01:14.450> sure<00:01:14.630> how

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
get a free star I'm not exactly sure how

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.690 
get a free star I'm not exactly sure how
many<00:01:14.900> roundy's<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.650> need<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.890> save<00:01:16.070> per<00:01:16.310> level

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
many roundy's you need to save per level

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.560 
many roundy's you need to save per level
to<00:01:17.030> pass<00:01:17.480> but<00:01:18.820> after<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> certain<00:01:20.000> point<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
to pass but after a certain point you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.450 
to pass but after a certain point you
fail<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.930> game<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.410> fail<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.740> level<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.100> not

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
fail the game you fail the level of not

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.370 
fail the game you fail the level of not
enough<00:01:22.670> round<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.000> survive<00:01:23.330> stick<00:01:24.110> look<00:01:24.290> at

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
enough round you survive stick look at

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.620 
enough round you survive stick look at
this<00:01:24.470> level<00:01:24.730> 50<00:01:25.730> round<00:01:26.150> these<00:01:26.330> come<00:01:26.600> in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
this level 50 round these come in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.660 
this level 50 round these come in
different<00:01:26.840> shapes<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.740> make<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.520> game<00:01:28.640> more

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
different shapes to make the game more

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.320 
different shapes to make the game more
difficult<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:30.710> have<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.830> circular<00:01:31.730> around<00:01:32.180> be

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
difficult we have a circular around be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.660 
difficult we have a circular around be
over<00:01:32.480> here<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.410> this<00:01:33.680> guy's<00:01:33.890> likely<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.520> roll

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
over here so this guy's likely to roll

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:46.150 
over here so this guy's likely to roll
over<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:35.150> over<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.450> place<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.910> close<00:01:45.160> okay

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
over all over the place so close okay

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.080 
over all over the place so close okay
better<00:01:47.120> than<00:01:47.270> nothing<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.760> was<00:01:49.850> saying

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
better than nothing and as I was saying

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.360 
better than nothing and as I was saying
the<00:01:50.300> game<00:01:50.420> gets<00:01:50.720> progressively<00:01:51.020> gets<00:01:51.590> harder

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
the game gets progressively gets harder

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.670 
the game gets progressively gets harder
and<00:01:52.550> more<00:01:52.670> difficult<00:01:53.090> some<00:01:54.050> levels<00:01:54.410> are<00:01:54.500> just

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and more difficult some levels are just

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.630 
and more difficult some levels are just
ridiculously<00:01:55.250> difficult<00:01:55.910> like<00:01:56.770> unbelievably

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.190 

impossible

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
impossible

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.810 
impossible
no<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.680> feel<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> help<00:02:05.250> yes<00:02:05.490> do

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
no I think I just feel that help yes do

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.609 
no I think I just feel that help yes do
not<00:02:06.000> enough<00:02:06.210> wrongly<00:02:06.420> survive<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.170> level<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
not enough wrongly survive so level is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:17.080 
not enough wrongly survive so level is
fail<00:02:07.799> let's<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.640> give<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.789> another<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:10.940> okay

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.120 

and<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.750> guess<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.290> actually<00:02:19.440> destroy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and I guess you can actually destroy

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.490 
and I guess you can actually destroy
roundy's<00:02:20.670> themselves<00:02:21.239> if<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.510> don't<00:02:21.690> if

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
roundy's themselves if you don't if
