pink but it's kind of like a hot pink I
would<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.210> it'd<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:52.500> purple<00:01:52.829> than<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
would think it'd be more purple than I

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
would think it'd be more purple than I
thought<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.360> love

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
thought it was going to be but I love

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.319 
thought it was going to be but I love
the<00:01:55.110> color<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.829> great<00:01:56.070> color<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the color it's a great color it's a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
the color it's a great color it's a
perfect<00:01:57.750> size<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.490> reason<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.939> bought

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
perfect size and the reason I bought

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
perfect size and the reason I bought
this<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.290> I've<00:02:02.219> been<00:02:02.280> any<00:02:02.729> more

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
this was because I've been any more

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.139 
this was because I've been any more
issues<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.600> skin<00:02:04.049> lately<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.430> thought

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
issues with my skin lately and I thought

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
issues with my skin lately and I thought
that<00:02:06.210> part<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> reason<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:08.300> meeting

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that part of the reason was just meeting

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.690 
that part of the reason was just meeting
that<00:02:09.899> extra<00:02:10.470> step<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.190> my

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that extra step in my

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.100 
that extra step in my
care<00:02:12.060> routine<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.660> don't<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:15.989> of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
care routine and so I don't I kind of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
care routine and so I don't I kind of
kind<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.739> back<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.099> don't<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.459> oily

really<00:02:49.260> fresh<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.549> clean<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.890> do

to some that has dry skin it didn't

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.890 
to some that has dry skin it didn't
necessarily<00:03:02.000> clear<00:03:03.000> up<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:03.660> dry

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900

patches<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.370> said<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.849> was<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
patches on like it said it was going to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.660 
patches on like it said it was going to
but<00:03:07.140> my<00:03:07.380> biggest<00:03:07.650> thing<00:03:08.010> about<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.640> is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
but my biggest thing about this one is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.630 
but my biggest thing about this one is
it<00:03:08.819> definitely<00:03:09.750> takes<00:03:10.019> off<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.680> makeup<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
it definitely takes off more makeup so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
it definitely takes off more makeup so
I've<00:03:11.790> tested<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.299> before<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.810> I've<00:03:12.989> watched

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
I've tested it before like I've watched

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.699 
I've tested it before like I've watched
my<00:03:13.709> face<00:03:13.980> completely<00:03:14.400> wash<00:03:14.790> my<00:03:14.970> face<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.209> my

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
my face completely wash my face with my

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.349 
my face completely wash my face with my
cleanser<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.459> put<00:03:17.700> more<00:03:17.910> cleanser<00:03:18.329> on

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
cleanser and then I put more cleanser on

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.250 
cleanser and then I put more cleanser on
and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:18.930> use<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.920> minute<00:03:20.220> and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
and then use this for the minute and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.470 
and then use this for the minute and
more<00:03:22.260> makeup<00:03:22.560> definitely<00:03:23.100> comes<00:03:23.370> off<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.209> it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
more makeup definitely comes off so it's

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
more makeup definitely comes off so it's
definitely<00:03:25.019> really<00:03:25.440> getting<00:03:25.859> all<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.250> that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
definitely really getting all of that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.009 
definitely really getting all of that
makeup<00:03:26.579> off<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.120> night<00:03:27.359> which<00:03:27.600> i<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.810> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
makeup off at night which i think is

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.770 
makeup off at night which i think is
really<00:03:28.560> important<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.150> think<00:03:30.299> that's<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
really important so I think that's a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.949 
really important so I think that's a
huge<00:03:31.260> help<00:03:31.980> with<00:03:32.340> my<00:03:32.549> skin<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.090> think<00:03:33.840> it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
huge help with my skin I think it

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.039 
huge help with my skin I think it

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
definitely looks more like radiant it

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.259 
definitely looks more like radiant it
definitely<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.500> looks<00:03:37.859> brighter<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.239> I

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
definitely just looks brighter so I

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.970 
definitely just looks brighter so I
would<00:03:39.510> definitely<00:03:39.540> give<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.260> review<00:03:40.680> it

definitely has great qualities for that

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.240 
definitely has great qualities for that
and<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.480> really<00:03:45.480> um<00:03:45.720> gets<00:03:46.530> all<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:46.950> makeup

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and it really um gets all of that makeup

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.890 
and it really um gets all of that makeup
off<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.639> if<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.819> wear<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> lot<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.329> makeup<00:03:48.630> of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
off so if you wear a lot of makeup of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.990 
off so if you wear a lot of makeup of
your<00:03:48.930> wearing<00:03:49.380> foundations<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.250> definitely

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
your wearing foundations I definitely

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.210 
your wearing foundations I definitely
think<00:03:51.359> one<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.750> these<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.680> important

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
think one of these is really important

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.670 
think one of these is really important
to<00:03:53.400> keeping<00:03:54.359> your<00:03:54.540> skin<00:03:54.750> looking<00:03:55.319> clean<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
to keeping your skin looking clean and

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.039 
to keeping your skin looking clean and
healthy<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> definitely<00:03:57.150> recommend<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.870> for

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
healthy so I definitely recommend it for

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.180 
healthy so I definitely recommend it for
that<00:03:58.200> reason<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.859> well<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.709> also<00:04:01.859> says

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that reason as well so and it also says

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.900 
that reason as well so and it also says
that<00:04:02.220> it's<00:04:02.459> supposed<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.790> make<00:04:02.970> your<00:04:03.799> um<00:04:04.910> make

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
that it's supposed to make your um make

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.800 
that it's supposed to make your um make
your<00:04:06.329> lotions<00:04:07.639> like<00:04:08.639> absorb<00:04:09.120> better<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.750> do

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
your lotions like absorb better and I do

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.569 
your lotions like absorb better and I do
believe<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.440> does<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.769> as<00:04:10.980> well<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.400> always

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
believe it does that as well I always

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.940 
believe it does that as well I always
use<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.079> morning<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:13.620> at<00:04:13.769> night

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
as well and I can feel the lotion it's

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.759 
as well and I can feel the lotion it's
kind<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.579> weird<00:04:17.849> but<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.000> can<00:04:18.150> really<00:04:18.329> feel<00:04:18.720> it

the cleanser I haven't used the cleanser

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.600 
the cleanser I haven't used the cleanser
yet<00:04:30.700> so<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.480> using<00:04:31.750> my<00:04:32.020> same<00:04:32.470> one<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.370> I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
yet so I was using my same one that I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.840 
yet so I was using my same one that I
was<00:04:33.760> using<00:04:34.000> before<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:35.640> think<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.700> other

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
was using before I think the other

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.810 
was using before I think the other
reason<00:04:37.480> why<00:04:37.780> I<00:04:37.810> was<00:04:38.200> interested<00:04:38.920> in<00:04:39.160> trying<00:04:39.580> it

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
reason why I was interested in trying it

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.320 
reason why I was interested in trying it
was<00:04:40.000> just<00:04:40.300> because<00:04:41.460> like<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.700> says<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.150> fine

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
was just because like it says that fine

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.380 
was just because like it says that fine
lines<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.900> wrinkles<00:04:43.990> appear<00:04:44.620> reduced<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.700> not

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
lines and wrinkles appear reduced so not

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.150 
lines and wrinkles appear reduced so not
that<00:04:46.420> i<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:46.900> really<00:04:47.200> wrinkles<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:47.800> i<00:04:47.860> think

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
that i have really wrinkles but i think

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.090 
that i have really wrinkles but i think
that<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.550> would<00:04:48.700> definitely<00:04:48.940> help<00:04:49.300> with<00:04:50.100> those

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
that it would definitely help with those

that it would definitely help with those
areas<00:04:51.670> too<00:04:51.970> i<00:04:52.000> think<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.630> if<00:04:52.840> you're

got my braces off I wanted an electric
toothbrush<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:19.900> don't<00:05:20.050> know<00:05:20.110> why<00:05:20.290> but<00:05:20.320> that's

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
toothbrush I don't know why but that's

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.120 
toothbrush I don't know why but that's
really<00:05:21.070> what<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.220> wanted<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.660> I<00:05:22.960> know<00:05:23.860> that

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
really what I wanted and I know that

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.590 
really what I wanted and I know that
that<00:05:24.280> makes<00:05:24.460> a<00:05:24.580> huge<00:05:24.760> difference<00:05:25.090> with<00:05:25.450> my

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
that makes a huge difference with my

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.120 
that makes a huge difference with my
teeth<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.230> think<00:05:26.470> it's<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> same<00:05:26.890> thing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
teeth and I think it's the same thing

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.130 
teeth and I think it's the same thing
with<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.310> skin<00:05:27.670> so<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.150> definitely<00:05:28.750> recommend

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
with the skin so I definitely recommend

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.800 
with the skin so I definitely recommend
it<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:30.490> is<00:05:30.670> a<00:05:30.700> little<00:05:30.970> bit<00:05:31.090> of<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.270> high<00:05:31.450> price

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it it is a little bit of a high price

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.690 
it it is a little bit of a high price
point<00:05:32.140> is<00:05:32.230> one<00:05:32.380> hundred<00:05:32.710> fifty<00:05:32.800> dollars<00:05:33.280> so
