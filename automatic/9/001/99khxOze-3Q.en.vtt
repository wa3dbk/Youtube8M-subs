00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
fighting the Omega earthier which is

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.730 
fighting the Omega earthier which is
this<00:00:05.549> big<00:00:05.850> beast<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.450> he's<00:00:07.290> pretty<00:00:07.560> tough

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
this big beast here he's pretty tough

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.049 
this big beast here he's pretty tough
this<00:00:07.980> guy<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.550> gonna<00:00:08.639> stick<00:00:09.000> with

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
this guy but I'm gonna stick with

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.589 
this guy but I'm gonna stick with
defending<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:11.210> schemata<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
defending with my schemata that has a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.010 
defending with my schemata that has a
hundred<00:00:13.049> percent<00:00:13.170> physical<00:00:13.860> resistance<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
hundred percent physical resistance and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.760 
hundred percent physical resistance and
hopefully<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.199> should<00:00:16.320> block<00:00:16.500> all<00:00:16.650> his

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
hopefully that should block all his

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.170 
hopefully that should block all his
attacks<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> only<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> won't<00:00:17.730> block<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
attacks the only one it won't block is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.130 
attacks the only one it won't block is
when<00:00:18.330> he<00:00:18.420> transmits<00:00:18.810> status<00:00:19.170> effects<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
when he transmits status effects on you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.870 
when he transmits status effects on you
which<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.830> should<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> minute<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
which you should use in a minute and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
which you should use in a minute and
I'll<00:00:24.029> give<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.420> example<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.050> hammer<00:00:25.320> was

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I'll give an example of that hammer was

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.400 
I'll give an example of that hammer was
cool<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:27.090> till<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:27.510> I'll<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
cool but till then I'll there go on and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.810 
cool but till then I'll there go on and
feel<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.710> Goods<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.580> will<00:00:29.699> put

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
feel so Goods the one that will put

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
feel so Goods the one that will put
loads<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.420> terrible<00:00:30.900> status<00:00:31.140> effects<00:00:31.349> on

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
loads of terrible status effects on

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
loads of terrible status effects on
usually<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> guard<00:00:32.279> against<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.669> even<00:00:33.059> if

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
usually got a guard against that even if

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.310 
usually got a guard against that even if
you<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> neuron<00:00:34.070> defensive<00:00:35.570> Sukumar<00:00:36.570> I'm

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you are a neuron defensive Sukumar I'm

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750 
you are a neuron defensive Sukumar I'm
sent<00:00:37.590> physical<00:00:37.860> resistance<00:00:38.070> will<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:38.460> stop

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
sent physical resistance will not stop

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.050 
sent physical resistance will not stop
satisfactory<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> guard

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.030 

trying<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.810> his<00:00:42.960> chain<00:00:43.170> gauge<00:00:43.380> art<00:00:43.650> if<00:00:43.740> you<00:00:43.830> can

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
trying to his chain gauge art if you can

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
trying to his chain gauge art if you can
use<00:00:44.820> Armus<00:00:45.120> arrows<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:45.990> when<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.470> can

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
use Armus arrows and then when you can

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.250 
use Armus arrows and then when you can
got<00:00:47.700> defend<00:00:48.030> against<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.540> obviously<00:00:48.990> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
got defend against that obviously and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.620 
got defend against that obviously and
then<00:00:49.950> you've<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.310> try<00:00:50.580> news<00:00:50.850> beat<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.330> if

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
then you've got a try news beat down if

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.140 
then you've got a try news beat down if
you<00:00:51.780> using<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> same<00:00:52.440> system<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.920> am<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.790> try

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
you using the same system I am to try

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.750 
you using the same system I am to try
and<00:00:54.620> stagger<00:00:55.620> him<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.400> once<00:00:56.640> he

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and stagger him because once he

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
and stagger him because once he
staggered<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.450> then<00:00:57.690> put<00:00:57.990> deep<00:00:58.140> sex<00:00:58.440> on

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
staggered you can then put deep sex on

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.070 
staggered you can then put deep sex on
him<00:00:58.740> stagger<00:00:59.400> him<00:00:59.550> second<00:00:59.910> time<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.360> then<00:01:00.840> he

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
him stagger him second time and then he

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.720 
him stagger him second time and then he
will<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.470> staggered<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.830> lot<00:01:01.980> longer<00:01:02.100> deep<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
will be staggered a lot longer deep that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.370 
will be staggered a lot longer deep that
won't<00:01:02.880> last<00:01:03.030> long<00:01:03.240> so<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.990> use<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.559> too

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
won't last long so you can use it too

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.600 
won't last long so you can use it too
take<00:01:06.530> out<00:01:06.710> most<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:07.159> health<00:01:07.399> especially

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
take out most of this health especially

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.310 
take out most of this health especially
use<00:01:08.030> overclock<00:01:08.539> because<00:01:08.719> E<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.990> lot<00:01:09.200> more

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
use overclock because E is a lot more

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.560 
use overclock because E is a lot more
powerful<00:01:09.500> than<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:10.039> regular<00:01:10.130> Athiya<00:01:13.329> that<00:01:14.329> will

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
powerful than a regular Athiya that will

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.120 
powerful than a regular Athiya that will
take<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> while<00:01:15.079> I<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.560> say

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.280 

there<00:01:19.729> we<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:20.030> there<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.270> daggits

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.500 

so<00:01:26.290> now<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.740> feet<00:01:26.950> away<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.000> second

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
so now I can feet away and in a second

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.420 
so now I can feet away and in a second
II<00:01:28.630> will<00:01:28.930> using<00:01:29.770> move<00:01:29.920> Commerce<00:01:30.220> Clause<00:01:30.340> I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
II will using move Commerce Clause I

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.580 
II will using move Commerce Clause I
