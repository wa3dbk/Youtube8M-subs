down<00:02:04.030> below<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.329> didn't<00:02:04.689> do<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.960> for<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.200> sake

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
down below I didn't do that for the sake

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.649 
down below I didn't do that for the sake
of<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.530> tutorial<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.090> can<00:02:07.299> do<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.539> as

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
of this tutorial but you can do that as

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.199 
of this tutorial but you can do that as
well<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.220> kind<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.549> click<00:02:09.700> build<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
well so you just kind of click build and

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.390 
well so you just kind of click build and
save<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.260> fusion<00:02:11.769> file<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.130> going<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.340> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
save the fusion file it's going to be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500 
save the fusion file it's going to be
created<00:02:12.819> wherever<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> want

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
