that's the body's natural way of trying

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
that's the body's natural way of trying
to<00:01:11.100> pop<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.820> whatever<00:01:12.180> object<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.080> there

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.499 
danger of while they're taking that big
breath<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.680> potentially<00:01:53.509> dislodge

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
breath in we could potentially dislodge

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
breath in we could potentially dislodge
that<00:01:54.540> object<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.909> breathe<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that object and they could breathe it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.539 
that object and they could breathe it
further<00:01:57.360> down<00:01:57.799> possibly<00:01:58.799> blocking<00:01:59.220> off<00:01:59.340> their

two three four five now obviously if the

object comes out after the first back
blow<00:03:40.920> we're<00:03:41.280> not<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.640> do<00:03:41.700> all<00:03:41.849> five

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
blow we're not going to do all five

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.660 
blow we're not going to do all five
however<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.769> back<00:03:43.950> blows<00:03:44.160> up<00:03:44.430> working

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
however if the back blows up working

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.580 
however if the back blows up working
we're<00:03:45.180> going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.480> turn<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.750> child<00:03:45.959> over<00:03:46.349> and

we're going to turn the child over and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.680 
we're going to turn the child over and
hopefully<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.519> movement<00:03:47.940> will<00:03:48.090> also<00:03:48.540> help

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
hopefully that movement will also help

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.440 
hopefully that movement will also help
to<00:03:48.870> dislodge<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.410> object<00:03:50.090> between<00:03:51.090> the
