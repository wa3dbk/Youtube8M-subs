colors I would say this would be a great
investment<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.440> think<00:03:37.709> you'd<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.250> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
investment I think you'd have it for a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.160 
investment I think you'd have it for a
very<00:03:38.549> long<00:03:38.760> time<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.269> didn't<00:03:39.540> use<00:03:39.630> every<00:03:39.930> color

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
very long time I didn't use every color

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.590 
very long time I didn't use every color
except<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.620> black<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.910> palette<00:03:42.299> and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
except for black here in the palette and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.180 
except for black here in the palette and
I<00:03:43.140> thought<00:03:43.320> they<00:03:43.440> were<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.620> beautiful<00:03:44.040> they

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
I thought they were all beautiful they

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.370 
I thought they were all beautiful they
did<00:03:44.609> blend<00:03:44.850> out<00:03:44.970> really<00:03:45.180> beautifully<00:03:45.750> so

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
did blend out really beautifully so

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.289 
did blend out really beautifully so
although<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> am<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.640> send<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.910> back<00:03:47.940> I'm

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
although I am going to send it back I'm

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.150 
although I am going to send it back I'm
going<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.780> give<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.109> palette<00:03:49.470> thumbs<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.920> if

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
going to give this palette thumbs up if

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.729 
going to give this palette thumbs up if
you<00:03:50.549> need<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.760> good<00:03:51.120> neutral<00:03:51.630> palette<00:03:52.170> if

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
you need a good neutral palette if

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.920 
you need a good neutral palette if
you're<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.070> me<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.519> your<00:03:53.910> makeup<00:03:54.090> order<00:03:54.600> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you're like me and your makeup order and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.720 
you're like me and your makeup order and
you<00:03:55.560> realize<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.010> spend<00:03:56.250> way<00:03:56.400> too<00:03:56.430> much<00:03:56.579> money

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
you realize you spend way too much money

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.360 
you realize you spend way too much money
on<00:03:57.030> makeup<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.890> would<00:03:58.890> say<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.190> need

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
on makeup I would say you don't need

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.699 
on makeup I would say you don't need
this<00:03:59.519> there<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> similar<00:04:00.959> palette<00:04:01.350> at

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
this there is a similar palette at

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.160 
this there is a similar palette at
Target<00:04:02.459> by<00:04:02.640> Sonia<00:04:02.850> Kashuk<00:04:03.120> there<00:04:03.750> are<00:04:03.840> tons

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170

and tons of Duke videos out there on

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.520 
and tons of Duke videos out there on
this<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.720> if<00:04:06.870> you're<00:04:07.019> interested<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.500> think

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
this so if you're interested I think

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.030 
this so if you're interested I think
that's<00:04:07.829> 20<00:04:08.159> bucks<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.730> go<00:04:09.330> get<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.599> dupe

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
that's 20 bucks you go get the dupe

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.440 
that's 20 bucks you go get the dupe
probably<00:04:11.040> very<00:04:11.190> similar

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
probably very similar

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.059 
probably very similar
so<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.349> think<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.920> great

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
so you know I think this is a great

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.589 
so you know I think this is a great
palette<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:14.610> think<00:04:14.819> it's<00:04:14.940> worth<00:04:15.090> 80<00:04:15.300> bucks

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
palette don't think it's worth 80 bucks

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.080 
palette don't think it's worth 80 bucks
probably<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.919> because<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.310> already<00:04:17.609> own<00:04:17.790> all

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
probably not because I already own all

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.569 
probably not because I already own all
of<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.720> shadows<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.220> my<00:04:20.400> quick

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
of the shadows so that is just my quick

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.420 
of the shadows so that is just my quick
thoughts<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.690> visor<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.500> use<00:04:22.680> art<00:04:22.889> palette

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.790 
I do think that they the colors blended
out<00:04:26.910> beautifully<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.630> will<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.320> close-up<00:04:28.620> now
