did<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:07.919> closed<00:00:08.250> captioning<00:00:08.870> right<00:00:09.870> now<00:00:10.080> I'm

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
did some closed captioning right now I'm

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
did some closed captioning right now I'm
learning<00:00:10.860> machine<00:00:11.190> theory<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.900> won't<00:00:13.139> be

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
learning machine theory so you won't be

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.650 
learning machine theory so you won't be
hearing<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.559> me<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:15.179> taking<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
hearing from me about I'm taking the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.500 
hearing from me about I'm taking the
test<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> build<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:16.440> seat<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.000> trying<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
test to build my seat I'm just trying to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.390 
test to build my seat I'm just trying to
learn<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> speak<00:00:19.320> another<00:00:19.590> language<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
learn how to speak another language and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200 
learn how to speak another language and
the<00:00:20.789> language<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.689> called<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:23.519> skin<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> graph

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the language is called the skin of graph

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.640 
the language is called the skin of graph
theory<00:00:24.480> huh<00:00:24.900> there<00:00:25.859> are<00:00:25.980> three<00:00:26.250> books<00:00:27.650> they're

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
theory huh there are three books they're

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.540 
theory huh there are three books they're
sick<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:31.230> these<00:00:31.439> books<00:00:31.740> it'll<00:00:32.040> teach<00:00:32.189> me

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
sick and in these books it'll teach me

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.720 
sick and in these books it'll teach me
the<00:00:33.149> theory<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.780> need<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.730> was

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the theory that I need to know I was

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.020 
the theory that I need to know I was
told<00:00:36.059> by<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:36.750> mentor<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.730> three

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
told by my mentor that there are three

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
things that I'm going to need 1 i'm

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
things that I'm going to need 1 i'm
going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.770> time<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> practice<00:00:44.430> time

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
going to need time time to practice time

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.590 
going to need time time to practice time
to<00:00:45.539> learn<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:47.100> i'm<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.940> need<00:00:48.059> patience

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to learn to i'm going to need patience

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.540 
to learn to i'm going to need patience
because<00:00:49.469> i'm<00:00:50.309> learning<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.820> new<00:00:50.850> language<00:00:51.469> I

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
because i'm learning a new language I

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.369 
because i'm learning a new language I
don't<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:55.140> me

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.399 
think period as a variet I don't think
of<00:01:06.659> hitting<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.650> keys<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> comma<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
of hitting three keys for a comma I

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.190 
of hitting three keys for a comma I
think<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.590> coming<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.720> don't<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
think it's coming I don't think of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
think it's coming I don't think of
hitting<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.040> teens<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:14.729> activating

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
hitting for teens when I'm activating
