00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 hi youtuber are eyepet and good pepper 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 year to all the gentlemen we are in 2014 and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
 even on ipad the most glamorous in nothing is over 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 there was no kind of millennium 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 bug or other cup and the like 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 we simply changed year 2014 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 how to turn it into a turn like 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.489
 turning a break on the butterfield 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 how to transform a turning point in life 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 in the study of love in the sediment 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540
 in the family 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 this depends on you my advice is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.120
 be positive 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 be optimistic invented new things 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.050
 do a reset of some topic of the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.789
 your life and try to improve it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.850
 take the things you don't know how to do e 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.430
 learn to do this will be the topic 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 of this video renewing search 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 always new projects to follow them up 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 in the end without ever giving up this is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.439
 what I am doing with 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 hyper more gaming ie creating a channel 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.650
 that in Italy goes to cover a leak that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 was not present that slams first 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 also on other games to bring back a little 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 gaming at its primordial state ie 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 to focus on the game on how 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.939
 improve our experience on how 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 review not that this is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 the only content you should see on 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.460
 youtube in fact as you notice I never have 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.030
 criticized no one else within the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 Italian community all channels have 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 sacrosanct right to stand 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 simply because they offer 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 different experiences 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 I also give you examples I feel 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 very criticize people like luke 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.180
 people like johnny creek people like 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.009
 gianpi you with walls sometimes instead 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.450
 I think they all have talents 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.009
 innati s also indeed from youtuber 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 different try to limit them I would not be 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.090
 ridiculous absolutely yes and I tell you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.829
 sincerely that they are channels that there 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.780
 they go like everyone else 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.549
 in this channel the goal is always 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
 state of focusing on gaming 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.360
 we said about importing something in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.869
 Italy was not there 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.759
 and here is the purpose for 2014 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.140
 what do we carry abroad? 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.520
 abroad it is not there 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 and abroad we can bring our own 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.620
 passion for things our design 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 where by design I don't mean so much 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.060
 production of objects but thinking about 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.130
 things that is when you set up a project 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.770
 how do you think me well in my opinion 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.900
 Italians on this are really the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.420
 mouse we have a fantasy a folklore a 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 color a culture that allows us to 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.739
 doing these allows us to be a little 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.590
 more so a little more aesthetically a 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.270
 nicer as well as the others 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.950
 populations are not nice because 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 I mean his own culture 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.290
 habits and his ways of making people laugh 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.090
 but I find that we do not on this 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 we have an extra gear but for sure 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.930
 we don't have one less gear 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.660
 if we then add to this the fact 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.220
 that for a three-year graduate of 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 mechanical engineering like me you are 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.940
 to graduate in the specialist is going to 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.810
 enter this amazing world from 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.820
 work that seems quite complicated 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.560
 English today is a fundamental language 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.260
 knowing it well makes you make a nice o 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.519
 bad figure and also for one person 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.560
 like me who had experience 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.890
 abroad that he was lucky enough to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.329
 always studying more or less well 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.640
 the obvious English you know you use it for 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.030
 write maybe even perfectly but 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.959
 you are not used to what you call 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.610
 conversation that the thing that really 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.560
 of does learn languages ​​for this ho 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.239
 skidded for money and you go to do a 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.950
 year abroad for example in London that 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.220
 it would really be a dream but unfortunately 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.870
 you can't because your father can't 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.730
 he breaks his back to work to send you 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.620
 to fuck around in london but to get you 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.120
 a laura a piece of paper to start 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.450
 to work to do something of yours 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.390
 life that takes you to a future enough 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.600
 or at least as concrete as possible, well 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.459
 youtube is also an abnormal tool 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.410
 because of this because it allows me to 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.850
 train me to talk you noticed that 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.320
 compared to my first videos, it came to me 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.640
 an almost talkative talk see 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.110
 that we started talking fast almost 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.430
 almost not in the street for me since not in 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.459
 tram pò because I got the gab 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.120
 thanks to youtube and it's the same thing as 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.610
 I want to do with English ok nothing 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.070
 easier 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.769
 for those who didn't know what happened to me 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.500
 created a second channel that will remain 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.630
 second ok not main this will come 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.240
 his community will be touched on 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.370
 his future projects will remain unchanged 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.130
 created a second youtube channel that yes 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.420
 calls to and because it just spaghetti 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.350
 samuni of a few Italian here 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.360
 spaghetti don't go exactly 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.040
 going crazy I'm always the ones in 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.690
 family that wants mum short pasta 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.390
 rows and pens and fusilli do not seem to 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.190
 spaghetti because I honestly don't 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.050
 like processes i eat them if i have to 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.910
 I don't hate eating them though 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.440
 everyone always wants and I don't want them 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.710
 so this came to mind 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.250
 first name 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.930
 simply the second channel will be a 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.690
 gaming channel but addressed 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.040
 totally differently we can 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.620
 be some video where maybe you give 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.840
 any advice on things I know and 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.710
 I think I can share but most 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.810
 part of the time will be based on this 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.020
 iet spaghetti that is david i'm ok 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.910
 I'm a person, not even David gamer 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.770
 david and david who wants to improve the 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.750
 his English through video games and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.460
 through youtube a community 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.530
 crazy of people who are always 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.970
 ready to help me 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.680
 obviously there will also be bimbiminkia 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.800
 but as usual less rinsing the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.690
 earthquake and let's go on like this if I have to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.580
 being honest already makes me turn a little 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.530
 balls that someone actually goes to 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.780
 only two people came and said 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.000
 a said to your pronunciation sucks 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.460
 answered mar you really are a phenomenon 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.760
 because objectively I hardly have you 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.900
 explained in a video I'm looking for 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.520
 make this new adventure for 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.080
 improve the pronunciation and you go immediately 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.580
 comment so it goes well there lit. 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.370
 just the second bulb instead 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.350
 he was a worried writing no because you 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.720
 ridicules Italians abroad 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.960
 because they already think of the panza ciccia 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.790
 mafia spaghetti pizza is not so expensive 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.410
 my I repeat I had the experience 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.180
 to being I have always been respected 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.590
 but not because I'm a mobster because of me 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.150
 I am presented as what I am 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.060
 guy who tries to be nice of 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.669
 do group company and it is obvious that the 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.430
 my pronunciation is immediately tagged ta 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.680
 with a non-foreign Italian pronunciation 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.700
 but not for this it cannot be 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.890
 respected in the world with membership cards 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.990
 nice people people with 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.210
 of the goals of the people they are 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.750
 determined in what they do then 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.940
 not 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.490
 worry i am a very person 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.650
 stubborn and I will continue in this 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.750
 objective obviously the videos will be 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.980
 something like a video a week 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.170
 video every two weeks 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.610
 a video every when it wants is obvious 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.250
 it is a second channel and serves exactly 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.650
 to that so I hope most 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.780
 part of you run to sign up for 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.730

 listen to some english to see 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.730
