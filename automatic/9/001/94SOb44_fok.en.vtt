alive and stay invigorated over a long
period<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.960> time<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.070> many

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
period of time we have to use many

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.600 
period of time we have to use many
theories<00:01:06.210> tools<00:01:06.630> methods<00:01:07.020> practices<00:01:08.010> in

theories tools methods practices in
order<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> actually<00:01:09.240> build<00:01:09.750> spirit-filled

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
order to actually build spirit-filled

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.880 
order to actually build spirit-filled
organizations<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> become

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
organizations and so we have to become

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.250 
organizations and so we have to become
more<00:01:13.890> agile<00:01:14.190> at<00:01:14.640> moving<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
more agile at moving from one way of

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.990 
more agile at moving from one way of
building<00:01:16.380> community<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.190> another<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> book

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
you're using a comprehensive approach if

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160 
you're using a comprehensive approach if

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
well has anybody else done this use this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.220 
well has anybody else done this use this
kind<00:02:14.909> of<00:02:15.030> approach<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.540> how'd<00:02:15.659> that<00:02:15.690> turn<00:02:16.050> out

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
kind of approach and how'd that turn out

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.820 
kind of approach and how'd that turn out
there's<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.530> section<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> book<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.580> has

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
there's a section in the book that has

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.830 
there's a section in the book that has
to<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.220> skills<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.970> practices<00:02:19.180> where

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
to do with skills and practices where

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.240 
to do with skills and practices where
you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.230> say<00:02:20.410> well<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:20.800> am<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.950> going<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.160> do

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
you can say well what am I going to do

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.040 
you can say well what am I going to do
next<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:21.640> am<00:02:21.760> i<00:02:21.820> doing<00:02:22.150> Tuesday<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.810> how<00:02:22.870> am

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
next what am i doing Tuesday and how am

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.110 
next what am i doing Tuesday and how am
I<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> approach<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.820> tangible

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I going to approach this in a tangible

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
I going to approach this in a tangible
way<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.870> there's<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.140> section<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.160> check

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
way so there's a section that check

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300 
way so there's a section that check
whether<00:02:27.670> you're<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.360> fact<00:02:28.660> using<00:02:29.650> some<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
whether you're in fact using some of the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.850 
whether you're in fact using some of the
tools<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:31.090> others<00:02:31.750> are<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.320> then<00:02:32.590> there's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
tools that others are and then there's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.280 
tools that others are and then there's
the<00:02:33.280> interpersonal<00:02:33.880> dimensions<00:02:34.660> dealing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the interpersonal dimensions dealing

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.560 
the interpersonal dimensions dealing
with<00:02:35.470> community<00:02:35.980> how<00:02:36.160> our<00:02:36.610> relationships<00:02:37.420> our

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
with community how our relationships our

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.690 
with community how our relationships our
capacity<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.260> communicate<00:02:38.440> our<00:02:39.040> capacity<00:02:39.640> to

capacity to communicate our capacity to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.240 
capacity to communicate our capacity to
deal<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.060> group<00:02:40.870> dynamics<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.740> stresses

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
deal with group dynamics the stresses

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.880 
deal with group dynamics the stresses
and<00:02:42.400> conflicts<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.120> community<00:02:43.710> conflict<00:02:44.710> and

and conflicts of community conflict and
discord<00:02:45.370> are<00:02:45.880> often<00:02:46.630> seen<00:02:46.870> as<00:02:47.050> enemies<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
discord are often seen as enemies of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.140 
discord are often seen as enemies of
community<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.610> most<00:02:48.820> people<00:02:49.120> don't

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
community and that most people don't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.170 
community and that most people don't
know<00:02:49.570> they're<00:02:49.840> actually<00:02:50.260> quite<00:02:50.610> friendly<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
know they're actually quite friendly to

spirit<00:02:52.720> coming<00:02:53.080> into<00:02:53.380> community<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:54.310> just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
spirit coming into community it just

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.880 
spirit coming into community it just
requires<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.210> skill<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.870> recognize<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
requires a skill to recognize that it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.870 
requires a skill to recognize that it's
one<00:02:57.250> stage<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.810> process<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.980> unfolds<00:03:00.760> over

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
one stage of a process that unfolds over

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.300 
one stage of a process that unfolds over
time<00:03:01.270> we<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.990> actually<00:03:02.230> learn<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:03.160> become

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
time we can actually learn to become

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.730 
time we can actually learn to become
large<00:03:03.820> enough<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.510> include<00:03:04.810> another<00:03:05.230> person's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
large enough to include another person's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.090 
large enough to include another person's
position<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:07.680> capacity<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.830> become

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
position and that capacity to become

position and that capacity to become
large<00:03:09.430> enough<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.180> central<00:03:10.750> driver<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
large enough is the central driver of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.890 
large enough is the central driver of
how<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.459> build<00:03:12.850> more<00:03:13.150> inclusive<00:03:13.780> and

how to build more inclusive and

how to build more inclusive and
pluralistic<00:03:14.440> communities<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.910> we

pluralistic communities and when we

pluralistic communities and when we
