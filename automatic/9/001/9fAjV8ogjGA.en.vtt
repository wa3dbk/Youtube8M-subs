00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.299
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 on be tv for a new video of 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.360
 presentation of a configuration 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 so today I present to you and the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.510
 amd gamer configuration here version 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.009
 with a 7870 galls was said sean 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 banker a little more expensive but if this 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:33.660
 version there and at 719 euros the version 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 with the 7150 1 gig and 659 next 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.580
 you also have a 7152 giga inversion 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 so already to start you can 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.830
 see at first the case 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.360
 aerocool strike the black on fout 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.720
 still black and red so much 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.400
 larouche 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.920
 you can find the video of 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.930
 unpacking and full presentations on 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 the main chain but until when 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 even quickly showed them 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.200
 features so it is very rich 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.360
 you especially have a mission to 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.420
 conciliation with two fans 120 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.430
 mm at the front a 140 mm on the top 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.689
 and one or two 120 mm at the back and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 especially its red led so certainly 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.039
 pretty nice beauty theme you have 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 usb3 front 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.409
 alain ports usb2 plus a socket 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.909
 headphone a micro button that shines 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 so that's all pretty classic 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.310
 you have a rather pretty design 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.579
 with dx11 was also already seeing the big 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 issa the mesh front that will allow 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.429
 a good relationship 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 it is also very incomplete can 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.759
 find the complete unpacking video 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.929
 on the main chain 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.939
 then at the configuration level 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.429
 guardian of the case you have the map 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.100
 mother asus n 5 to 97 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.009
 yves to forecasts 2.0 so with 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 some features besides the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.319
 motherboard is not bad if you have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 usb support 3 fronts at the back 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.520
 you will find 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.820
 wearing ds 2% siaka mice a lot 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.140
 of the usb3 sb again of the guide y 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.420
 live internet knowledge of firewire 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 a usb socket to restore your bios 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.119
 in case of problem and 7.1 audio 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.480
 in this range to you have the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.630
 amd fx 6100 processor from a processor to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.160
 six hearts that he's chilled by the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.280
 shot of cooler cooling one 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.770
 master hyper tx3 or the 212 ivo I do not 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 remember more 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.300
 accompanied by 8 gigas of ram so there 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 than beyond the corsair venture of which 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.860
 camille 6 years old my guys who has no one 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 very good performance index I 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.510
 will show right after embodies the girl 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.750
 that you have to choose the 7150 1 or 2 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.790
 gigas alas here we went 7170 byers so 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.950
 at 719 euros 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.660
 then you have of course a hard drive 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.760
 of 500 ga blue caviar class 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.230
 terminal a dvd player you can 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.170
 see here at the front a feeding of 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.930
 500 watts recurring antecedent gamer without 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.580
 have certified and pink hypnosis 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.170
 I also just forget the exits 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.989
 video on the graphics card that you 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.160
 have dvi then debit on the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.160
 recipes 1150 an opinion on the 5870 from 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.209
 disney little of Islam carries on the 5870 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.540
 1 of 5850 and a HDMI port of 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.010
 cards 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.870
 So that's a good exit 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.070
 video if you want more info on the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.320
 case it's in the video of 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.480
 presentation 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.790
 and so I went clearly to 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.709
 performance with crysis 2 over three years 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.970
 granted 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.400
 so here is crysis 2 is also the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.750
 windows performance indexes is it going 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.740
 allow to see a little bit 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.840
 performance of this jam 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.220
 we see here we find ourselves on crysis 2 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.950
 I wanted to quickly show you the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.400
 field performance with the 7870 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.990
 gates so here we are inside with 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.270
 a lot of tessellation and effects of 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.000
 light so be able to tessellation 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.280
 also at the level of bricks and so at 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.230
 ffs level inside we are between 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.190
 40 and 50 fps just about every time we are 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.380
 above and in interest outside this 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.730
 will be between 30 and 40 rather a little less 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.400
 it will be seen that level 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.640
 graphics it's very very fluid and 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.290
 totally playable solo then at 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.600
 level of video settings games toumi 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.350
 at most so a whole ultra world with 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.350
 high resolution textures 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.960
 here with a little resolution full hd 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.090
 all in ultra active direction and that's it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 so I showed you a little bit about 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.500
 temperatures that we get with 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:51.690
 coop there I would say hardware monitor hop 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.520
 I want to zoom in here 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.700
 then at the temperature level we 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.040
 gets at the processor level 41 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.220
 degrees which is very good with the hyper 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.500
 tx3 and for the graphics card it's 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.340
 all the way down you currently have 1 53 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.380
 degrees while the room about avatar 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.860
 rigging at the level of 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.600
 public performance and 6 to 3 and 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.100
 temperature then to finish this 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.450
 presentation to show you the clues 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.930
 of performance here is up 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.550
 so here we see the amd fx 6100 and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.940
 the gig of ram to turn that so at 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.530
 processor level we have 7 3 memory 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.190
 live and recipes the graphics card to 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.800
 7.9 so well with the 5970 and the disk 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.900
 hard at 5.9 so here they exclude this is 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.650
 normal that we can see that the clues 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.300
 are very good and that's very bad so I 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.340
 think that was all for that of 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.630
 presentation I tell you next time 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.430
 do not hesitate to subscribe to this 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.670
 chain to be kept abreast of 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.670
 new
