00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
really important now that there's no

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.470 
really important now that there's no
more<00:00:12.190> speak<00:00:12.959> there's<00:00:13.959> a<00:00:14.049> lot<00:00:14.289> more<00:00:14.559> rally<00:00:14.980> now

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
more speak there's a lot more rally now

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.430 
more speak there's a lot more rally now
tonight<00:00:16.480> said<00:00:16.780> only<00:00:17.020> like<00:00:17.500> history<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:19.150> guy

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
tonight said only like history the guy

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.900 
tonight said only like history the guy
topspin<00:00:20.440> and<00:00:20.619> you<00:00:20.679> can't<00:00:20.890> leave<00:00:21.039> it<00:00:21.189> it's<00:00:21.460> over

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
topspin and you can't leave it it's over

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.759 
topspin and you can't leave it it's over
no<00:00:22.300> it's<00:00:22.480> like<00:00:22.599> cantaloupe<00:00:23.080> when<00:00:23.260> contribute

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
no it's like cantaloupe when contribute

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.429 
no it's like cantaloupe when contribute
nowadays<00:00:24.189> it's<00:00:24.519> much<00:00:24.820> more<00:00:25.060> rally<00:00:25.359> this<00:00:26.320> is

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
nowadays it's much more rally this is

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.470 
nowadays it's much more rally this is
why<00:00:26.590> it's<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.800> missus<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.730> super<00:00:28.119> point<00:00:28.390> in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
why it's that missus is super point in

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.689 
why it's that missus is super point in
the<00:00:28.570> first<00:00:28.779> ball<00:00:28.990> of<00:00:29.170> course<00:00:29.410> ball<00:00:30.250> so<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.609> have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
the first ball of course ball so we have

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.360 
the first ball of course ball so we have
to<00:00:30.820> post<00:00:31.000> a<00:00:31.119> lot<00:00:31.269> on<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.839> rally<00:00:32.080> and<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:33.100> third

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
to post a lot on the rally and the third

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.790 
to post a lot on the rally and the third
fourth<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:33.940> fifth<00:00:34.030> balls<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:37.649> those<00:00:38.649> who

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
fourth and fifth balls so those who

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.040 
fourth and fifth balls so those who
think<00:00:39.039> I'm<00:00:39.460> gonna<00:00:39.670> steal<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.660> also<00:00:40.780> do

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
think I'm gonna steal it you can also do

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.040 
think I'm gonna steal it you can also do
like<00:00:41.079> side<00:00:41.739> spin<00:00:42.100> come<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.760> new<00:00:42.910> right<00:00:43.239> so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
like side spin come to new right so

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.619 
like side spin come to new right so
let's<00:00:44.530> say<00:00:44.710> if<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.399> get<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.579> ball<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.270> it's

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
let's say if I get a ball and it's

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.810 
let's say if I get a ball and it's
either<00:00:49.809> you<00:00:50.530> think<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> guy<00:00:51.070> topspin<00:00:51.579> right

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
either you think the guy topspin right

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.299 
either you think the guy topspin right
and<00:00:51.969> this<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.390> lot<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.600> Spain<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:54.100> very

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
and this is a lot of Spain it's very

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.490 
and this is a lot of Spain it's very
difficult<00:00:54.760> sometimes<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.359> touch<00:00:55.719> it<00:00:55.899> here

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
difficult sometimes to touch it here

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.430 
difficult sometimes to touch it here
because<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.000> energy<00:00:58.269> all<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.960> spin<00:00:59.230> is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
because all the energy all the spin is

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.279 
because all the energy all the spin is
here<00:00:59.949> right<00:01:00.100> there<00:01:00.280> like<00:01:00.579> up<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.059> down<00:01:01.210> but<00:01:02.109> on

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
here right there like up and down but on

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.250 
here right there like up and down but on
the<00:01:02.440> side<00:01:02.679> there's<00:01:02.920> nothing<00:01:03.340> right<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:05.110> is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
the side there's nothing right this is

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.530 
the side there's nothing right this is
what<00:01:05.470> sometimes<00:01:05.890> all<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.520> can<00:01:06.640> do<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.090> you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
what sometimes all you can do is you

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.140 
what sometimes all you can do is you
just<00:01:07.570> like<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.170> play<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.640> side<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.939> touch

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
just like you play on the side you touch

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.990 
just like you play on the side you touch
the<00:01:10.270> ball<00:01:10.420> on<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> side<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.490> there's<00:01:12.880> actually

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the ball on the side so there's actually

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.770 
the ball on the side so there's actually
no<00:01:13.659> spin<00:01:13.990> there<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:15.040> way<00:01:15.299> sets<00:01:16.299> been<00:01:16.509> here

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
no spin there so this way sets been here

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.380 
no spin there so this way sets been here
or<00:01:17.080> seismic<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.770> other<00:01:17.890> way<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.180> can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
or seismic the other way and so you can

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.039 
or seismic the other way and so you can
neutralize<00:01:19.829> this<00:01:20.829> pin<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.369> then<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.810> play

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
neutralize this pin and then you play

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.600 
neutralize this pin and then you play
with<00:01:23.259> this<00:01:23.350> energy<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.070> can<00:01:24.250> just<00:01:24.430> come

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
with this energy and you can just come

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:46.770 
with this energy and you can just come
to<00:01:24.759> group<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.390> both<00:01:25.689> sides

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.270 

I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:48.100> ladies<00:01:48.370> employers<00:01:49.890> thought<00:01:50.890> it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
I think ladies employers thought it's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.940 
I think ladies employers thought it's
difficult<00:01:51.700> if<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:51.820> go<00:01:51.940> side<00:01:52.120> spin<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.770> cannot

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
difficult if you go side spin you cannot

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.650 
difficult if you go side spin you cannot
touch<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.340> as<00:01:54.460> much<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.820> with<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.480> you

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
touch it as much it with you as you

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.230 
touch it as much it with you as you
would<00:01:55.750> do<00:01:55.870> with<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.500> straight<00:01:56.770> draftsman<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
would do with a straight draftsman you

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240 
would do with a straight draftsman you
have<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.450> touch<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.990> little<00:01:59.260> little<00:02:00.130> more

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
have to touch it a little little more

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.150 
have to touch it a little little more
behind<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.650> so<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.860> way<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.100> can

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
behind you and so this way you can

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.090 
behind you and so this way you can
execute<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.910> size
