00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.299
 I wanted to tell you about how I 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.299
 I am going to finish the grill and that's why 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.540
 the most unpleasant thing in any campaign is 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:24.180
 when the lattice falls from the brazier 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:27.180
 side and so the concept of refinement 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.399
 that's the reason 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.899
 groundwork the reason is that the lattice is like 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.030
 any rule 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.460
 sales do not fit any form 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 braziers well if only those lattices 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 which have an elongated portion of this one 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 Here are the designs So here so not 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.180
 quite right for where is this something 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.239
 burns somewhere something more cool 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:06.350
 like this is also wrong well, but here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.460
 but there is no solution 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.749
 decision usually 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.619
 a noose bought in a regular store 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:22.520
 20 rubles and that's what we'll do now 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.520
 such a thought 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.590
 and that's what we get
