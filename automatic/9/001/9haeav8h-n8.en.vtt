00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 But this we go over to the toaster oven 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.049
 It depends on the size and quantity of the plate 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.270
 I would like to go over about approximately 7 to 10 minutes 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.270
 In the burning of Shi location wait please 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.590
 It was completed over over 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:22.350
 The seal melts and it has been accumulated for a while in such a part 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.170

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.120

 It is such a feeling 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.810
 Pretty smell is still not good with curry Mao Neko smell came out 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.710
 Let's eat 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.300
 Such feeling 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.300
 It is darts curadoria Onion seems to be surprisingly good and how to hear it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 Another retort curry is going to be a restaurant 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:06.380
 I luxury is different satisfaction at all 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 The eggs and their cheese and curry are matching so well 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.880
 Insanely delicious ground 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.200
 Now in fact I practiced once 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:22.010
 In I bought sleep a little slightly Nde got out that retort curry as it is 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.819
 Pat now piping hot it was in the Burren 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.620
 It is good if there is a surprisingly crunchy onions that were laid under 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:36.290
 I pull down the yearly onion down, I like a student living alone 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.280
 He Conversely It is recommended to people living alone surplus even without 's retort curry 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.030
 I think that there is also a way to arrange the curry that was overcooked and left over like this 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 If even one who lives in the family 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.110
 If you try it, it may be a great c 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.110
 I will eat it because it is a noun 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.890
 Book a place pass 12 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.860

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.550

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.640

 And ultra surely Do some more this curry era little adjuvant changed or Once the more delicious 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.340
 I think it's red red 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.019
 I think it's a bit simpler and I think I 'll be better if I add something myself 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.900
 Whether it is punishment 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.250
 Another one fact little it looseness but I had to put my retort curry as it is after 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.440
 I think I came out 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.050
 So when I do that, I think I'm going to cook curry when I warm or take that originally 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.270
 I think I can do it 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.300
 Why 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.870
 87 points This is usually recommended 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.430
