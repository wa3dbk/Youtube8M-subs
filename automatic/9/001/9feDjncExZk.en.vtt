hmm okay so today I want to show you how
to<00:00:13.110> teach<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.889> trick

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.260 

just<00:00:23.770> like<00:00:23.949> anything<00:00:24.279> else<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.820> way<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.000> teach

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
just like anything else the way to teach

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.060 
just like anything else the way to teach
this<00:00:25.510> is<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.840> break<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.289> up<00:00:26.380> into<00:00:26.590> smaller

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
this is to break it up into smaller

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.279 
this is to break it up into smaller
components<00:00:27.849> let's<00:00:28.300> take<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.510> look<00:00:28.750> first<00:00:28.990> at

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
components let's take a look first at

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.069 
components let's take a look first at
how<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.500> can<00:00:29.800> teach<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.189> back<00:00:30.340> up<00:00:33.720> it's<00:00:34.720> best

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
how you can teach the back up it's best

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.799 
how you can teach the back up it's best
to<00:00:35.170> use<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.470> small<00:00:36.010> enclosed<00:00:36.700> area<00:00:37.300> like<00:00:37.510> this

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
to use a small enclosed area like this

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.689 
to use a small enclosed area like this
because<00:00:38.620> it's<00:00:38.800> going<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.070> make<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.489> lot

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
because it's going to make it a lot

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.939 
because it's going to make it a lot
easier<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.269> lower<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.930> dog<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.350> take<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.590> step

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
easier to lower the dog to take a step

00:00:41.949 --> 00:01:14.719 
easier to lower the dog to take a step
backwards

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.750 

backed<00:01:15.729> up<00:01:15.970> back<00:01:16.540> next<00:01:17.440> teach<00:01:18.010> your<00:01:18.220> dog<00:01:18.370> to<00:01:18.610> do

from you circle some dogs may be

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.370 
from you circle some dogs may be

and finally we can combine these two
things<00:02:33.310> together<00:02:38.219> very<00:02:39.219> gradually<00:02:39.969> you<00:02:40.120> can

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
things together very gradually you can

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.270 
things together very gradually you can
also<00:02:40.480> build<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.260> distance<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.099> dog

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
also build on the distance the dog

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.179 
also build on the distance the dog
travels<00:02:42.879> before<00:02:43.299> they<00:02:43.689> get<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
travels before they get to you and

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.559
