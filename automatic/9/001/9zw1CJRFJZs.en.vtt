00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.270
 Shower and today I want you 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.890
 show how your car where such a car 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.960
 boring them for example or 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.090
 Of course, that goes with every car for 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.310
 a tuning show or tuning meeting 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.410
 can make you really cool so that you 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.180
 time the highlight in this spring 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.349
 since I want to meet you 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.559
 show how you once your 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.080
 Engine room can open so that all 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.489
 all the people there are your cool engine times 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.960
 Here you can marvel 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.340
 must be at a certain point on the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.080
 engine room meet that once 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.760
 then excited again a few times afterwards 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.100
 shoot to continue another bit 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.269
 and then found out there are two 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.320
 and then you can with the 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.180
 Determine how far the incident 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.790
 bonnet rises when your natural 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.379
 punkt finds where that goes right on the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.059
 then you will not be bonnet 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.760
 see such filthy bullet holes 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.739
 as she sees her with me then comes 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.180
 now the second trick i show you how 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.530
 you simply lower your car 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.210
 may be acting for example now 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.010
 already lowered your car before 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 Of course, that's a lot 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.760
 cooler then the tires are there 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.590
 automatically much more oblique than usual 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.000
 and the car really deep you can see it 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.050
 top rubber edge for example 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.820
 sometimes not anymore 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.230
 the car is here just standard 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.000
 been stolen from the street 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.550
 and since you can not see the stop so great 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.350
 how deep can actually go then 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.720
 I 'm pretty pretty, though 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 you'll see that I'll shoot you 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.180
 a little bit yes that's on everyone here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.650
 one of my cases is now noticed 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.780
 He has such tips and tricks 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.700
 tutorial and if you like more of them 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.040
 little tips and tricks to see in 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.590
 gta 5 we get really cool stuff 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.080
 can or small errors only then 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.240
 keep your thumb up so I know 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.860
 that you really see something like that somehow 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.300
 want and something is also interesting 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.110
 then I would continue for something like that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.420
 pick out you 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 You do not see it that way 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.110
 strong as the car but slightly slanted 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.510
 now we are trying now 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.159
 sometimes back a little run to shoot 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.719
 Yes exactly 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.899
 maybe important to say that you 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.390
 Weapons need a strong 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.560
 have firepower or thick patron on 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 I did the ak here 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.230
 Of course, with the mg that's a lot 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.970
 meaningful there is with one 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.560
 shot more harm or more power 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.610
 you see how the car per shot 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.440
 is pressed deeper 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.840
 of course that's what it would be with 1 mg 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.610
 stronger but I always recommend this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.049
 so a maximum of three shows are to each other 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 close because if you bring more skis 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.099
 I did not notice anything 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.989
 always said shoot very carefully and 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.580
 then you see how from time to time that 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.620
 car goes deeper now you see 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 let's see how deep that is really cool 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 that's important for that, too 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.489
 that he has no bulletproof tires 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.959
 that means you need the standard tires 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.640
 but you can choose any one 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.989
 have reared that is not important 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.090
 and then if your car of course 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.739
 is more armored then goes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.849
 bonnet also he later on when it 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.200
 it did not fit the mother 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.609
 but very fast on as here 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.690
 me in the video is still the 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.160
 right point so you do not meet 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.750
 tracking bullet holes you have 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.890
 seen how deep the car is on one side 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.239
 page on the other still on the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 page where I have not done anything the 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 high that it looks really cool 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.980
 Now I'll show you again 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.720
 Just leave your light on a car 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.889
 So not only with police 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.489
 if you do not look for it 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.590
 can let 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.790
 you just have to shoot around for a while 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.319
 a short-circuit and then goes into 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.700
 get in the car and then directly again 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.829
 then you can also get video too 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.690
 Do it naturally and your car has a motor 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.639
 on and light on that is definitely 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 if you have tuning in the dark tuning 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.269
 really cool when a car with xenon 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.709
 light stands therewith you are on all 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.630
 Falls of attention when all cars 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.910
 stand and a car is the only one 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.709
 with light on much lower than 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.200
 any other car you see here is again 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.819
 how deep that is incredible and you 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.109
 You see , that's on the left 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.459
 The standard times though I do not 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.410
 has shot against and legal assistance 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.090
 laid looks on all events 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.470
 if you liked this trick 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.180
 which as I said for more last one 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.590
 thumb up there and otherwise I say 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.010
 I hope see you next time 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.010
 Video
