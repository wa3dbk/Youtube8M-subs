00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
opinion now the first one here is just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
opinion now the first one here is just
dive<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.920> prone<00:00:22.949> off<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> bounce<00:00:23.760> prod<00:00:23.970> near

party on a knife towards a zombie with a
bit<00:00:59.430> look<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.760> should<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> air<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
bit look you should go up in the air and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
bit look you should go up in the air and
it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> hard<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.670> might<00:01:02.850> take<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> few

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it's not that hard but might take a few

tries<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.840> much<00:01:04.019> height<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> then

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
tries to get that much height and then

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.100
