00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
games I mean you just want to do this

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.660 
games I mean you just want to do this
just<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.409> sack<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.920> ahead<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.579> I'm

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
just to get the sack go ahead and I'm

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.130 
just to get the sack go ahead and I'm
going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.880> try<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:33.899> try

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
going to try to do this on the first try

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
going to try to do this on the first try
and<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.280> don't<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.819> then<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.509> going

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and if I don't get it then I'm not going

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
and if I don't get it then I'm not going
something<00:01:36.929> again<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> takes<00:01:38.099> too

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
something again because it takes too

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.389 
something again because it takes too
long<00:01:38.360> but<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:40.349> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.530> 15<00:01:40.950> seconds<00:01:41.340> on

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
long but on so you have 15 seconds on

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.789 
long but on so you have 15 seconds on
the<00:01:41.429> clock<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.119> cannot<00:01:42.420> miss<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> those

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the clock you cannot miss one of those

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.230 
the clock you cannot miss one of those
things<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> always<00:01:44.909> keep

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
things and you have to always keep

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.130 
things and you have to always keep
moving<00:01:45.599> so<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.679> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> try<00:01:47.099> it<00:01:47.159> again

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
moving so I'm going to try it again

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.300 
moving so I'm going to try it again
let's<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.349> can<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.560> again<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.920> did<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
let's see if I can do it again I did it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760 
let's see if I can do it again I did it
on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.459> second<00:01:50.819> try<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.319> then<00:01:52.319> there<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.739> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
on the second try and then there is a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
on the second try and then there is a
second<00:01:53.250> part<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.789> have<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> collect

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
second part where you have to collect

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.350 
second part where you have to collect
son<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.319> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> click<00:01:56.000> 10<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.239> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
son and you have to click 10 of them I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
son and you have to click 10 of them I
think<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:58.259> can't<00:01:58.500> same<00:01:58.799> same<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.369> applies

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
think you can't same same thing applies

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
think you can't same same thing applies
they<00:01:59.970> move<00:02:00.209> faster<00:02:00.720> side<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:01.079> side<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.439> you're
