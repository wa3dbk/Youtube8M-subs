00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 on happy together 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.210
 a simple and family dish 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.650
 stuffed potato dumplings 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.440
 then you will see we are going to start 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 by the stuffing then we have the stuffing of 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.279
 fine pork 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.110
 ok we'll put a little bit of salt m 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.390
 pretty tower of pose of the mill it is 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.739
 important that you're going to chop onion 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.630
 so you have a little 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.119
 remember and of course do it at the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.619
 there will not hand fingers and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.239
 now in the joke to bring 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.620
 binder you're going to put an egg is a 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.620
 little bread crumbs and 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.020
 now you 're going to add bread crumbs 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 bread 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 that's where I'm doing a mix must 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.970
 coriander and parsley dish I lodge 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.100
 a little bit roughly who was hearing 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.970
 not bad no it's really brought from 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.370
 taste the recipe tac tac tac but of a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.010
 blow the air and you mix me all that for 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.079
 to make a homogeneous mixture by that the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.280
 mixture is homogeneous and there we go on 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.000
 know how to wash our hands we will make 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.860
 little dumplings had their hands 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.690
 look do that according to who the children 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.400
 are going to be happy about the big fate 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.300
 near a walnut still black here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.890
 when shapes them and you put them here 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.750
 what's important is that the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.610
 dumplings be fairly regular 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.860
 bangkok in the end you go or cooking 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.049
 act the noblet are ready we're going 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.640
 now tackle the puree but 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.320
 not just any pure and mashed to 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.520
 the mayonnaise then began the puree 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.049
 we have potatoes that are cooked 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.060
 floury potatoes 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.710
 that are cooked with the skin that we have 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 peeled which are still hot which 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.450
 is important when you are doing a cure 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.710
 and it's having more and band of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.060
 hot earth for her to take 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.810
 seasonings here I add rap and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 by far from nutmeg 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.790
 I love it I love Muscat in 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.020
 the device I add a nice pinch 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.320
 salt and fat in the recipe 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.689
 it's going to be when you bought pretty much 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.479
 the equivalent of two or three beautiful 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.970
 hateful statements and there you take 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.060
 my grandmother's famous mashed potato 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 and you're going to crush that there we see when 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720
 same time that we crush and ben on 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.849
 mix the whole thing is actually the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.069
 mayonnaise you see viollier already do 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.790
 an offer to wear hateful to hits and 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.750
 we will not have the room 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.060
 as well because they will see again 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.799
 it's also this taste of giving really 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.680
 a special taste to the recipe 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.909
 so now we're going to shape the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.099
 dumplings this is the most enjoyable side 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.019
 of the recipe we have three three plates 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.060
 flour of the offer that you will beat in 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.409
 doublettes 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.659
 here I put a little bit of salt 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.920
 you see a little weight so it's not 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.250
 bad to take a little bit of water 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.930
 okay and then we have bread crumbs 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.269
 simple bread all right I have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.980
 clean media I take the equivalent 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:55.709
 a pretty mashed nuts I do that I 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 go inside so that covers 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.329
 this is the meatball that's it 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.489
 make a hearty here we go there roll 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:09.870
 in the flour body you pass it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.099
 go there a restaurant that will soak you 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.900
 fingers it's me who's dirtying my hands 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.340
 here you are slightly drops here is a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.169
 little bit everywhere it's three times 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.579
 50000 to you drop them here 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.840
 well disgusted you saw him in the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.409
 Dutch breadcrumbs coming from the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.329
 bread crumbs 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.500
 we could also put some powder 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.760
 hazelnut almond powder 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.229
 why not pistachio powder 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.060
 are not very creative with 7 points 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.139
 okay and here we go now 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.099
