 wetzlar 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.880
 the border 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 presented by kinopolis pour the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.080
 twentieth edition of the hesse derby it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.970
 this time a duel of direct 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.460
 table neighbors the hsg seventh 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 received with the mt the current 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 table sixths and from the beginning 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 Should it be a fight-derby yes 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.930
 almost a kind of wear and tear fight with 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 slight advantages at the beginning for the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 guests from north hessen michael müller from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.510
 through the middle 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 müller one of four 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 melsunger players play that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 especially the green-white jersey wore 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 in the initial phase, the coverage of the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 guests very dense and behind drifting 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.550
 goalkeeper appelgren the hsg offensive to 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 Despair 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 Wetzlar held with team spirit and commitment 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 on the other hand, symbolically much outnumbered 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 the leadership by niko wiener for kent 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.780
 robin tönnissen something like that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.810
 initial ignition of norwegian steered 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.000
 in the meantime three hits for 9 to 6 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 for the HSG in the dazzling 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
 newcomer mama's purchase even put down 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.119
 on it wetzlar now with four goals 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.119
 ahead 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.080
 Coach Roth had his team 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.690
 Now wake up and the blew 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 then catch up especially 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.240
 müller turned on now he took part 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.649
 for that at half time 1 14 to 14 from 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.649
 the scoreboard lit up 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.440
 after the change, the hsg caught the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.480
 better start sebastian weaver will be 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.360
 nicely unlocked and wetzlar could 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.970
 now settle in the easy 21 to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.150
 8 10 for the hosts of the lahn 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.630
 because melsungen the lighter gates 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.200
 Threw the North Hesse again out 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.890
 21 to 21 and stayed close to 4,000 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400
 spectators in the witches cauldron rittal-arena 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.350
 amazingly cool 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580
 after this beautiful combination the melsunger 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.970
 again in front 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.980
 that gave confidence and so put mt 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.880
 director vukovic even one more 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.280
 kempa-trick on the plate more than for 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 connection by steffen fäth was enough 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.700
 no more 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.410
 the towering michael müller worried 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.950
 with his eighth hit on this 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.500
 evening the end and seal the 29th 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.500
 to 31 defeat for the HSG 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.269
 I think a mind game more so 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.840
 characterized by hectic in the second 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.620
 passage 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.670
 There were many punishments 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.480
 so much back and forth in the end as much 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.420
 worse just a bit 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.610
 unhappy today and I think today 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.830
 we have it for the last minute until the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.720
 last customer fought more 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.410
 the expected game at eye level and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.340
 a huge respect to wetzlar 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.340
 It was a lot of fun
