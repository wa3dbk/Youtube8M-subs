very<00:00:00.240> good<00:00:00.480> things<00:00:00.719> today<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:01.230> think<00:00:01.680> there's

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
very good things today I think there's

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.530 
very good things today I think there's
one<00:00:02.129> basis<00:00:02.639> on<00:00:02.820> which<00:00:03.000> there<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.360> no

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
one basis on which there is no

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.999 
one basis on which there is no
comparison<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.290> that's<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> fact<00:00:04.830> that

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
comparison and that's the fact that

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.610 
comparison and that's the fact that
older<00:00:05.879> gear<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:06.569> dating<00:00:06.899> from<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.080> 50s<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
older gear here dating from the 50s and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.060 
older gear here dating from the 50s and
60s<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:08.309> no<00:00:08.400> one<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> -<00:00:09.150> age<00:00:09.710> it's<00:00:10.710> made

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
60s that no one on the - age it's made

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.640 
60s that no one on the - age it's made
in<00:00:11.370> accordance<00:00:11.490> with<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:12.599> economy<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.230> scale

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
in accordance with an economy of scale

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770 
in accordance with an economy of scale
that<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.219> simply<00:00:14.639> impossible<00:00:14.820> today<00:00:15.599> when

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that is simply impossible today when

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.599 
that is simply impossible today when
people<00:00:17.510> 301<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:19.230> knew<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.310> design

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
people 301 they knew that was the design

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.340 
people 301 they knew that was the design
was<00:00:20.789> predicated<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> knowledge<00:00:22.320> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
was predicated on the knowledge that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
was predicated on the knowledge that
they<00:00:22.740> would<00:00:22.949> sell<00:00:23.449> thousands<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> things

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
they would sell thousands of the things

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560 
they would sell thousands of the things
and<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:26.070> could<00:00:26.279> afford<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.029> engineering

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and so they could afford the engineering

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
and so they could afford the engineering
costs<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:28.650> custom<00:00:29.160> castings<00:00:29.820> for

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
costs of you know custom castings for

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
costs of you know custom castings for
each<00:00:30.179> individual<00:00:30.750> piece<00:00:31.130> machine<00:00:32.130> fittings

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
each individual piece machine fittings

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
each individual piece machine fittings
do<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.660> piece<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.320> nice

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
do you know what make piece is very nice

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
do you know what make piece is very nice
it<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> look<00:00:35.969> at<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it so if you look at something like a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
it so if you look at something like a
301<00:00:37.200> orthotics<00:00:37.980> 124<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.030> something<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
301 orthotics 124 or something like that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.160 
301 orthotics 124 or something like that
it's<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.829> an<00:00:41.160> ineffable<00:00:41.579> quality<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it's there's an ineffable quality to it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's there's an ineffable quality to it
not<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> rare<00:00:44.820> materials<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.780> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
not just the rare materials not just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.560 
not just the rare materials not just
highly<00:00:46.410> polished<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.760> won't<00:00:48.420> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
highly polished things not just won't be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.959 
highly polished things not just won't be
designed<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.590> something<00:00:50.039> comes<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
designed but something comes off of it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.970 
designed but something comes off of it
that<00:00:51.149> says<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.489> pinnacle<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
that says this was the very pinnacle of

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.049 
that says this was the very pinnacle of
engineering<00:00:55.980> achievement<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:58.320> stand

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
engineering achievement I could stand

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
engineering achievement I could stand
shoulder-to-shoulder<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.780> products<00:01:01.559> from

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
shoulder-to-shoulder with products from

shoulder-to-shoulder with products from
other<00:01:01.859> genres<00:01:02.510> today<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.080> make<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> door<00:01:04.619> 301

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
other genres today to make the door 301

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.330 
other genres today to make the door 301
just<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.939> tool<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.590> product<00:01:08.250> would

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just a tool up for the product would

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
just a tool up for the product would
probably<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.360> priced<00:01:09.689> somewheres

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080

Thor and the Sun when it came over to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.270 
Thor and the Sun when it came over to
America<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> TV<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:18.990> point<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.530> bristle

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
America of the TV one point for bristle

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
America of the TV one point for bristle
for<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:21.150> hundred<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> ninety<00:01:21.750> dollars

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
for I think a hundred and ninety dollars

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
for I think a hundred and ninety dollars
is<00:01:22.439> correct<00:01:22.799> me<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.220> wrong<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is correct me if I'm wrong so if you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
is correct me if I'm wrong so if you
extrapolate<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.560> today's<00:01:26.040> dollars

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
extrapolate that into today's dollars

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
extrapolate that into today's dollars
that<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.850> still<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.229> hundred

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that would still be a little hundred

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
that would still be a little hundred
thousand<00:01:29.159> dollars<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.180> impossible

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
thousand dollars and it's impossible

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.410 
thousand dollars and it's impossible
today<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.939> terms<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.630> just

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
today so in terms of just

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.200 
today so in terms of just
it<00:01:35.259> would<00:01:35.439> never<00:01:35.650> be<00:01:35.799> a<00:01:35.950> product<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.670> in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
it would never be a product like that in

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.710 
it would never be a product like that in
terms<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.780> design<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.909> you<00:01:40.180> prep<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.540> know<00:01:40.659> if

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
terms of design is you prep to know if

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.690 
terms of design is you prep to know if
you've<00:01:40.869> read<00:01:41.020> my<00:01:41.080> my<00:01:41.680> stuff<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.189> magazine

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
you've read my my stuff in the magazine

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.399 
you've read my my stuff in the magazine
I<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:45.509> tend<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.689> enjoy<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.860> presentation

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I I tend to enjoy the presentation

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.740 
I I tend to enjoy the presentation
created<00:01:50.409> by<00:01:50.590> those<00:01:50.830> sorts<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.460> products<00:01:52.030> I'm

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
created by those sorts of products I'm

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
created by those sorts of products I'm
for<00:01:53.500> example<00:01:53.920> not<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:54.729> much<00:01:55.240> concerned<00:01:55.600> with

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
for example not so much concerned with

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.609 
for example not so much concerned with
imaging<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.939> think<00:01:58.180> stereo<00:01:58.479> imaging<00:01:59.110> the

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
imaging and I think stereo imaging the

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.590 
imaging and I think stereo imaging the
spatial<00:02:00.130> aspect<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.700> sound<00:02:00.880> reproduction<00:02:01.240> is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
spatial aspect of sound reproduction is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.840 
spatial aspect of sound reproduction is
one<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.110> which<00:02:02.289> we<00:02:02.619> really<00:02:03.369> have<00:02:03.520> come<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.729> very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
one in which we really have come a very

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.660 
one in which we really have come a very
long<00:02:04.210> way<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.229> much<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:05.890> even<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.550> have

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
long way so much so that even I have

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.919 
long way so much so that even I have
impressed<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> stuff<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.840> not

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
impressed in the stuff and it's not

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.540 
impressed in the stuff and it's not
really<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.289> important<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.130> compared<00:02:09.459> to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
really that important to the compared to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.759 
really that important to the compared to
other<00:02:09.729> aspects<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.209> performance<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.290> we've

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
other aspects of performance so we've

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.009 
other aspects of performance so we've
come<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> very<00:02:12.220> long<00:02:12.549> way<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.180> regard<00:02:13.569> any

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
come a very long way in that regard any

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.490 
come a very long way in that regard any
else<00:02:14.230> gonna<00:02:14.380> say<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.980> recording<00:02:15.489> listen<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
else gonna say the recording listen to a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.680 
else gonna say the recording listen to a
song<00:02:21.160> called<00:02:21.519> construction<00:02:22.299> by<00:02:22.450> this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
song called construction by this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.400 
song called construction by this
Japanese<00:02:23.230> DJ<00:02:23.799> camellias<00:02:24.370> two<00:02:25.209> pennies<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
Japanese DJ camellias two pennies on the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.570 
Japanese DJ camellias two pennies on the
soundstaging<00:02:28.709> yeah<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.769> has<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> stereo

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
soundstaging yeah it has to be a stereo

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.530 
soundstaging yeah it has to be a stereo
in<00:02:31.150> fact<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.540> moment<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.260> yeah<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:34.420> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
in fact there's a moment just yeah if I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.449 
in fact there's a moment just yeah if I
can<00:02:34.600> enjoy<00:02:34.930> one<00:02:35.170> summer<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.890> yeah<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.310> in

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
can enjoy one summer but yeah not in

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.900 
can enjoy one summer but yeah not in
that<00:02:36.580> sense

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
that sense

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.140 
that sense
so<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> admit<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.140> product<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.739> today<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.370> way

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so I admit the product that today is way

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.270 
so I admit the product that today is way
beyond<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.049> products<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.859> fifties<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
beyond the products of the fifties the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220 
beyond the products of the fifties the
sixties<00:02:42.549> in<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.030> regard<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.630> they've<00:02:43.989> come

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
sixties in that regard and they've come

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.130 
sixties in that regard and they've come
in<00:02:44.440> other<00:02:44.560> technical<00:02:45.160> aspects<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:46.140> didn't

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
in other technical aspects you didn't

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
in other technical aspects you didn't
have<00:02:47.320> amplifiers<00:02:47.980> back<00:02:48.400> then<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:49.980> fast

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
have amplifiers back then that fast

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160 
have amplifiers back then that fast
whoo<00:02:51.430> race<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.299> didn't<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.690> amplifiers

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
whoo race you didn't have amplifiers

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.860 
whoo race you didn't have amplifiers
back<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.739> were<00:02:53.829> particularly<00:02:54.310> new

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
back that were particularly new

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.990 
back that were particularly new
cuz<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.530> never<00:02:55.560> occurred<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> anybody<00:02:56.580> chief

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
cuz it never occurred to anybody chief

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
cuz it never occurred to anybody chief
maybe<00:02:57.239> bringing<00:02:57.569> these<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.200> Teresa<00:02:58.769> does

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
maybe bringing these for Teresa does

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
maybe bringing these for Teresa does
spend<00:02:59.760> eight<00:03:00.209> hours<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.780> day<00:03:00.810> sorting

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
spend eight hours a day sorting

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.140 
spend eight hours a day sorting
resistors<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.250> sorting<00:03:02.519> capacitors<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
resistors and sorting capacitors and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.940 
resistors and sorting capacitors and
making<00:03:03.390> sure<00:03:03.480> we've<00:03:03.599> got<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:03.870> value<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
making sure we've got the right value to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.070 
making sure we've got the right value to
maintain<00:03:05.760> channel<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> channel<00:03:06.390> balance<00:03:06.690> to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
maintain channel to channel balance to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.119 
maintain channel to channel balance to
maintain<00:03:07.489> neutrality<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.540> they<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.709> changed

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
maintain neutrality so they have changed

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.809 
maintain neutrality so they have changed
in<00:03:11.250> those<00:03:11.400> aspects<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.349> again<00:03:13.489> I'll<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.670> sort

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
in those aspects I again I'll just sort

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.250 
in those aspects I again I'll just sort
to<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:15.150> what<00:03:15.299> try<00:03:15.540> not<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.870> too<00:03:15.900> worried

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
to see what try not to be too worried

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.119 
to see what try not to be too worried
here<00:03:16.970> there<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.120> different<00:03:18.540> aspects<00:03:19.200> they're

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
here there are different aspects they're

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.229 
here there are different aspects they're
different<00:03:20.400> components<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> sound

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239

we have been hobbled in might even by a

we have been hobbled in might even by a
point<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.870> view<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.380> says<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.370> frequency

happen<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.170> old<00:03:37.410> smell<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.769> type<00:03:38.250> two

not high fidelity because we have

not high fidelity because we have

aspect of performance and we all have
the<00:03:52.440> right<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.790> prioritize<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.480> way<00:03:54.629> we

the right to prioritize in the way we

the right to prioritize in the way we

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
wish to prioritize so for example to me
