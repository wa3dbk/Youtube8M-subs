00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it into a little container and I use

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.509 
it into a little container and I use
that<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.660> clean<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.959> soldering<00:02:10.320> tip<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
that to clean my soldering tip it's

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.740 
that to clean my soldering tip it's
basically<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.060> same<00:02:12.239> thing<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.630> you'll

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
basically the same thing that you'll

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.440 
basically the same thing that you'll
spend<00:02:12.989> seven<00:02:13.350> or<00:02:13.440> eight<00:02:13.530> dollars<00:02:13.709> for<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
spend seven or eight dollars for in the

spend seven or eight dollars for in the
stores<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.200> online<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.310> clean<00:02:17.549> your<00:02:17.760> soldering

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570

tip<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.500> course<00:02:19.739> some<00:02:20.310> solder<00:02:20.579> I<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
tip and of course some solder I use a

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.039 
tip and of course some solder I use a
60/40<00:02:22.079> blend<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.980> light<00:02:23.850> duty<00:02:24.239> resin<00:02:24.750> core

60/40 blend of light duty resin core
solder<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.769> I<00:02:25.829> found<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> point<00:02:26.880> O<00:02:27.030> 32

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
solder and I found that the point O 32

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.580 
solder and I found that the point O 32
diameter<00:02:28.680> solder<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.989> best<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.410> most

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
diameter solder is the best for most

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.170 
diameter solder is the best for most
projects<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.370> comes<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> variety<00:02:32.850> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
projects and it comes in a variety of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.259 
projects and it comes in a variety of
thicknesses<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.730> may<00:02:35.910> occasionally

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
thicknesses and you may occasionally

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.710 
thicknesses and you may occasionally
need<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:37.549> desoldering<00:02:38.549> device<00:02:39.030> or<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.600> this

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
need a desoldering device or in this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.910 
need a desoldering device or in this
case<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.790> solder<00:02:41.790> sucker<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:43.709> make

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
case it's a solder sucker and they make

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860 
case it's a solder sucker and they make
these<00:02:44.130> uh<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> buy<00:02:45.269> them<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.600> six

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
these uh you can buy them up to six

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.930 
these uh you can buy them up to six
eight<00:02:46.049> hundred<00:02:46.350> dollars<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:46.950> ones<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.370> heat

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
eight hundred dollars for ones that heat

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.449 
eight hundred dollars for ones that heat
and<00:02:48.239> also<00:02:48.510> remove<00:02:49.079> solder<00:02:49.410> at<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.920> same<00:02:50.160> time

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and also remove solder at the same time

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.940 
and also remove solder at the same time
but<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:50.910> basically<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.260> sucker<00:02:52.620> you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
but this is basically just a sucker you

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.490 
but this is basically just a sucker you
would<00:02:53.070> heat<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.250> solder<00:02:53.579> up<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.470> remove<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
would heat the solder up and remove the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.800 
would heat the solder up and remove the
solder<00:02:55.950> joint<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.549> then<00:02:56.970> dispose<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
solder joint and then dispose of the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.550 
solder joint and then dispose of the
empty<00:02:58.560> solder<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.630> also<00:03:00.630> you'll<00:03:00.840> always<00:03:01.109> want

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
empty solder and also you'll always want

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.539 
empty solder and also you'll always want
to<00:03:01.859> use<00:03:02.340> some<00:03:02.699> type<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:03.180> fan<00:03:03.780> or<00:03:04.549> circulation

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
to use some type of fan or circulation

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.160 
to use some type of fan or circulation
to<00:03:05.970> suck<00:03:06.389> up<00:03:06.630> that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
to suck up that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.229 
to suck up that
nasty<00:03:07.800> solder<00:03:08.510> smoke<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.970> happens<00:03:11.970> to

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
nasty solder smoke and this happens to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.420 
nasty solder smoke and this happens to
draw<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> solder<00:03:13.590> smoke<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.190> through<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
draw the solder smoke in through a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.630 
draw the solder smoke in through a
filter<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:15.920> exhausts<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.430> back

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
filter and then exhausts it out the back

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.300 
filter and then exhausts it out the back
so<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.660> basic<00:03:18.810> things<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.440> need<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:20.130> some

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
so some basic things you need for some

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.520 
so some basic things you need for some
of<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.459> projects<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.060> now<00:03:21.330> let's<00:03:21.599> build<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
of the projects so now let's build the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.630 
of the projects so now let's build the

circuit board has the notations on one
side<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.250> you'll<00:03:47.459> actually<00:03:47.819> make<00:03:48.000> your

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
side but you'll actually make your

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.509 
side but you'll actually make your
solder<00:03:48.540> connections<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.680> other<00:03:49.860> side<00:03:50.280> of

like capacitors and diodes are called

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.570 
like capacitors and diodes are called
polarized<00:03:55.860> which<00:03:56.130> means<00:03:56.370> they<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.549> a

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
polarized which means they have a

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.030 
polarized which means they have a
positive<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.269> negative<00:03:57.360> side<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.319> need<00:03:58.950> to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
thing we're going to do is solder the IC

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.220 
thing we're going to do is solder the IC
sockets<00:04:10.980> now<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.459> purpose<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.660> sockets

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
sockets now the purpose of the sockets

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.310 
sockets now the purpose of the sockets
is<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.820> actual<00:04:15.420> IC<00:04:15.989> chips

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
is so that the actual IC chips

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.340 
is so that the actual IC chips
themselves<00:04:17.160> can<00:04:17.489> be<00:04:17.760> replaced<00:04:18.390> later<00:04:18.720> if<00:04:19.049> need

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
themselves can be replaced later if need

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.550 
themselves can be replaced later if need
be

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
be

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.590 
be
okay<00:04:19.919> we've<00:04:20.100> soldered<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.669> our<00:04:20.850> three<00:04:21.269> sockets

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
okay we've soldered in our three sockets

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.430 
okay we've soldered in our three sockets
and<00:04:22.109> also<00:04:22.890> soldered<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.640> our<00:04:23.880> diode<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.990> again

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and also soldered in our diode and again

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.469 
and also soldered in our diode and again
with<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.890> diode<00:04:26.070> make<00:04:26.490> sure<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.180> solder

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
with the diode make sure that you solder

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.170 
with the diode make sure that you solder
it<00:04:27.720> with<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> stripe<00:04:28.470> facing<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.490> same<00:04:29.850> side

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
it with the stripe facing the same side

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.270 
it with the stripe facing the same side
as<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.419> stripe<00:04:30.780> on<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> PCB<00:04:31.410> now<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.070> have<00:04:32.220> a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
as a stripe on the PCB now we have a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.700 
as a stripe on the PCB now we have a
bunch<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.580> mylar<00:04:33.090> capacitors<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.110> solder

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
bunch of mylar capacitors to solder

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.830 
bunch of mylar capacitors to solder
inand<00:04:35.160> these<00:04:35.250> are<00:04:35.400> non<00:04:35.580> polarized<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.630> there's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
inand these are non polarized so there's

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.990 
inand these are non polarized so there's
no<00:04:36.960> positive<00:04:37.560> or<00:04:37.650> negative<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:38.760> we<00:04:38.820> have

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
no positive or negative now we have

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.090 
no positive or negative now we have
sixteen<00:04:39.479> resistors<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.380> solder<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.860> place

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
sixteen resistors to solder in place

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.400 
sixteen resistors to solder in place
again<00:04:41.490> these<00:04:41.669> are<00:04:41.880> non<00:04:42.030> polarized<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.169> either

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
again these are non polarized so either

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.890 
again these are non polarized so either
n<00:04:43.710> can<00:04:44.070> go<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.310> either<00:04:44.490> hole<00:04:44.789> now<00:04:45.570> we're<00:04:45.720> ready

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
n can go in either hole now we're ready

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.050 
n can go in either hole now we're ready

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
our audio and video connectors so we'll

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.360 
our audio and video connectors so we'll
put<00:05:16.860> those<00:05:16.979> in<00:05:17.190> now<00:05:17.510> okay<00:05:18.510> our<00:05:18.780> PCB<00:05:19.470> is<00:05:19.950> done

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
put those in now okay our PCB is done

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.959 
put those in now okay our PCB is done
the

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
the

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.899 
the
remaining<00:05:21.329> step<00:05:21.629> is<00:05:21.779> to<00:05:21.929> install<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.499> ICS<00:05:23.489> now

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
remaining step is to install the ICS now

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.189 
remaining step is to install the ICS now
again<00:05:24.299> match<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:25.079> notch<00:05:25.559> on<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.699> IC<00:05:27.329> with<00:05:28.049> the

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
again match the notch on the IC with the

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.949 
again match the notch on the IC with the
notch<00:05:28.439> that's<00:05:28.979> on<00:05:29.399> the<00:05:29.579> IC<00:05:30.179> socket<00:05:30.809> and

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:30.959 
notch that's on the IC socket and

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.469 
notch that's on the IC socket and
sometimes<00:05:31.589> it<00:05:31.739> takes<00:05:31.769> a<00:05:32.009> little<00:05:32.099> bit<00:05:32.339> to<00:05:33.329> get

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
sometimes it takes a little bit to get

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.109 
sometimes it takes a little bit to get
those<00:05:33.689> in<00:05:33.959> there<00:05:34.199> they<00:05:34.409> don't<00:05:34.529> always<00:05:34.829> fit<00:05:35.339> the

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:36.119 
those in there they don't always fit the

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.799 
those in there they don't always fit the
first<00:05:36.329> time<00:05:36.689> so<00:05:37.229> double-check<00:05:37.919> your<00:05:38.539> each<00:05:39.539> of

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:39.809 
first time so double-check your each of

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.239 
first time so double-check your each of
your<00:05:39.959> leads<00:05:40.259> and<00:05:40.589> make<00:05:40.739> sure<00:05:40.889> that<00:05:41.039> they're

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
your leads and make sure that they're

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.109 
your leads and make sure that they're
going<00:05:41.459> in<00:05:41.729> nice<00:05:42.029> and<00:05:42.299> tight<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.749> straight<00:05:44.119> oK

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.119 
going in nice and tight and straight oK

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:46.999 
going in nice and tight and straight oK
we've<00:05:45.269> hooked<00:05:45.509> up<00:05:45.659> our<00:05:45.869> video<00:05:46.049> cable<00:05:46.709> and<00:05:46.889> our

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
we've hooked up our video cable and our

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.919 
we've hooked up our video cable and our
audio<00:05:47.399> cable<00:05:47.819> and<00:05:48.089> now<00:05:48.299> we're<00:05:48.689> going<00:05:48.809> to

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:48.929 
audio cable and now we're going to

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:53.059 
audio cable and now we're going to
supply<00:05:49.679> power<00:05:50.299> to<00:05:51.299> our<00:05:51.329> cellular<00:05:52.110> automata

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
supply power to our cellular automata

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.149 
supply power to our cellular automata
video<00:05:53.610> synthesizer<00:05:56.449> and<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.889> immediately

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
video synthesizer and it immediately

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.749 
video synthesizer and it immediately
begins<00:05:59.759> displaying<00:06:00.329> very<00:06:01.319> cool<00:06:01.759> random

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
begins displaying very cool random

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.379 
begins displaying very cool random
patterns<00:06:03.749> and<00:06:04.169> these<00:06:05.159> can<00:06:05.429> be<00:06:05.459> controlled<00:06:06.029> by

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
patterns and these can be controlled by

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.319 
patterns and these can be controlled by
three<00:06:06.869> different<00:06:07.999> potentiometers<00:06:08.999> which<00:06:09.179> we

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:09.329 
three different potentiometers which we

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:12.409 
three different potentiometers which we
installed<00:06:09.719> the<00:06:09.929> rate<00:06:10.319> the<00:06:11.189> rule<00:06:11.459> and<00:06:11.849> the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
installed the rate the rule and the

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.249 
installed the rate the rule and the
width<00:06:13.459> now<00:06:14.459> by<00:06:14.610> adjusting<00:06:15.059> all<00:06:15.269> three<00:06:15.719> you<00:06:16.079> get

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
width now by adjusting all three you get

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.799 
width now by adjusting all three you get
some<00:06:16.589> pretty<00:06:16.889> crazy<00:06:17.279> patterns<00:06:17.969> and<00:06:18.239> that's

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 
some pretty crazy patterns and that's

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.179 
some pretty crazy patterns and that's
how<00:06:18.959> you<00:06:19.019> build<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.529> cellular<00:06:20.309> automata<00:06:21.119> video

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
how you build a cellular automata video

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.100 
how you build a cellular automata video
synthesizer<00:06:23.189> we'll<00:06:23.759> see<00:06:23.879> you<00:06:23.969> next<00:06:24.179> week<00:06:24.329> with
