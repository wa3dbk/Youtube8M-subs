itself<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> material<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> case<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
itself the material the case is a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.370 
itself the material the case is a
synthetic<00:00:35.250> leather<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.780> real

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
synthetic leather so it's not real

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680 
synthetic leather so it's not real
leather<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.980> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> plasticy

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
leather it's kind of like a plasticy

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
leather it's kind of like a plasticy
leather<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.399> hard

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
leather I don't know it's a bit hard

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.840 
leather I don't know it's a bit hard
it's<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> soft<00:00:42.420> leather<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.739> same<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.250> for

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it's not a soft leather the same is for

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
it's not a soft leather the same is for
the<00:00:44.940> interior<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.260> made<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the interior it's all made out of the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
the interior it's all made out of the
same<00:00:46.920> material<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> mean<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.719> okay<00:00:49.440> it's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
same material so I mean that's okay it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.490 
same material so I mean that's okay it's
decent<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> mean<00:00:50.390> maybe<00:00:51.390> good<00:00:51.600> better<00:00:52.020> could've

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
decent I mean maybe good better could've

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
decent I mean maybe good better could've
been<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:52.829> softer<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:54.059> long<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
been a bit softer but as long as it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
been a bit softer but as long as it
protects<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> iPad<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.739> that's<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
protects the iPad you know that's all it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.959 
protects the iPad you know that's all it
matters<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> let's<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> iPad<00:00:59.160> 2<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
matters so let's put the iPad 2 in the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.750 
matters so let's put the iPad 2 in the
case<00:01:00.180> itself<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.949> I've<00:01:02.190> been<00:01:02.370> using<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
case itself now I've been using this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
case itself now I've been using this
case<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> around<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.539> week<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:05.960> found<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
case for around a week and I found it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.490 
case for around a week and I found it
pretty<00:01:07.350> good<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:09.320> really<00:01:10.320> like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pretty good I mean it's not really like

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.649 
pretty good I mean it's not really like
protective<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.400> far<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> case<00:01:12.090> goes<00:01:12.360> but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
protective as far as the case goes but

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.010 
protective as far as the case goes but
it's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.960> bad<00:01:13.170> -<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> how<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.750> looks

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it's not bad - so this is how it looks

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640 
it's not bad - so this is how it looks
with<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.670> iPad<00:01:17.670> 2<00:01:17.880> inside<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.470> that

with the iPad 2 inside you can see that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
with the iPad 2 inside you can see that
it<00:01:19.770> does<00:01:19.920> add<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> bulk<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> iPad<00:01:22.110> 2

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
landscape so the landscape mode is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
landscape so the landscape mode is
pretty<00:02:16.020> simple<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.040> take<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> iPad<00:02:17.850> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
pretty simple you just take the iPad and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.620 
pretty simple you just take the iPad and
you<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.260> put<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.670> this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
you just put it in like this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.930 
you just put it in like this
that's<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.560> landscape<00:02:23.190> mode<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.700> kind<00:02:23.910> of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
that's the landscape mode so it kind of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
that's the landscape mode so it kind of
looks<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.270> small<00:02:24.600> mini<00:02:24.930> netbook<00:02:25.440> it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.830 
looks like a small mini netbook it's
pretty<00:02:26.400> cool<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.120> standing<00:02:27.510> mode<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
pretty cool I like this standing mode to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.290 
pretty cool I like this standing mode to
take<00:02:28.020> notes<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:29.030> good<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> take

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
take notes it's really good to take

notes<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.340> then<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.820> other

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
notes with it and then then the other

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.170 
notes with it and then then the other
one<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:34.020> portrait<00:02:34.770> mode<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.700> basically

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
one is the portrait mode so basically

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.630 
one is the portrait mode so basically
all<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.590> remove<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> case

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
all you do is you just remove the case

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.270 
all you do is you just remove the case
from<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.550> have<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.880> hold<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.480> just

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
from here you have to hold it and just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.480 
from here you have to hold it and just
swivel<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:45.380> that's<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> pretty<00:02:46.860> simple<00:02:47.310> like

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
swivel it that's it pretty simple like

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.790 
swivel it that's it pretty simple like
that<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.570> that's<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> looks<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
that so that's how it looks in a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520 
that so that's how it looks in a
portrait<00:02:50.370> mode<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.930> mean<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.050> case<00:02:52.290> might<00:02:52.500> be

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
portrait mode I mean this case might be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.120 
portrait mode I mean this case might be
good<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:52.980> using<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:54.140> FaceTime<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.740> Skype

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
good for using a FaceTime or like Skype

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.030 
good for using a FaceTime or like Skype
but<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:57.150> taking<00:02:57.510> notes<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.110> prefer<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
but for taking notes I prefer a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.120 
but for taking notes I prefer a
landscape<00:02:59.490> mode<00:02:59.520> like<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.740> has<00:03:04.770> kind

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
landscape mode like this so it has kind

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.530 
landscape mode like this so it has kind
of<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> swivel<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.850> keyboard<00:03:09.090> itself

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
of like a swivel so the keyboard itself

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.870 
of like a swivel so the keyboard itself
is<00:03:09.780> actually<00:03:10.110> really<00:03:10.320> good<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.340> keys<00:03:11.580> feel

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
is actually really good the keys feel

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.550 
is actually really good the keys feel
like<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:12.360> from<00:03:12.540> Apple<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.140> wireless

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
like the one from Apple the wireless

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
like the one from Apple the wireless
keyboards<00:03:14.010> they're<00:03:14.160> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.610> hard<00:03:15.090> plastic

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.110 
keyboards they're kind of a hard plastic
material<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.170> they<00:03:16.320> won't<00:03:16.530> break<00:03:16.740> easily<00:03:17.120> also

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
material so they won't break easily also

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
like about this case is that when you

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.420 
like about this case is that when you

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
close the case there's no latch you know

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.510 
close the case there's no latch you know
to<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.880> lock<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.420> case<00:04:40.660> right<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.520> there's

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
to just lock the case right here there's

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.280 
to just lock the case right here there's
nothing<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:43.000> lock<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.450> that's<00:04:43.660> one<00:04:43.990> thing<00:04:44.020> that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
nothing to lock it that's one thing that

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.470 
nothing to lock it that's one thing that
I<00:04:44.470> didn't<00:04:44.770> like<00:04:44.860> because<00:04:45.280> even<00:04:45.940> if<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.300> put

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
I didn't like because even if you put

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.450 
I didn't like because even if you put
this<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:46.720> your<00:04:46.840> bag<00:04:47.080> right<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.040> still<00:04:48.280> open

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
this in your bag right it can still open

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.580 
this in your bag right it can still open
the<00:04:48.790> case<00:04:49.000> can<00:04:49.210> still<00:04:49.420> open<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.870> then<00:04:49.990> you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the case can still open and then you

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.710 
the case can still open and then you
know<00:04:50.710> if<00:04:50.830> your<00:04:50.980> bag<00:04:51.160> drops<00:04:51.550> your<00:04:51.820> screen<00:04:52.090> could

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
know if your bag drops your screen could

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.600 
know if your bag drops your screen could
get<00:04:52.960> damaged<00:04:53.440> potentially<00:04:54.040> damaged<00:04:54.400> so

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
get damaged potentially damaged so

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.340 
get damaged potentially damaged so
that's<00:04:55.090> one<00:04:55.420> thing<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.810> did<00:04:55.960> not<00:04:56.080> like<00:04:56.320> about

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
that's one thing I did not like about

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.710 
that's one thing I did not like about
this<00:04:56.800> case<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.820> add<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.120> bit<00:04:58.360> more

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
this case just to add a bit more

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.420 
this case just to add a bit more
protection<00:04:59.110> just<00:04:59.500> put<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> latch<00:04:59.950> here<00:05:00.220> to

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
protection just put a latch here to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.360 
protection just put a latch here to
secure<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.390> would<00:05:01.540> lock<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
secure it so it would lock that's the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.590 
secure it so it would lock that's the
only<00:05:03.520> negative<00:05:03.670> thing<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.180> found<00:05:04.330> about<00:05:04.480> this
