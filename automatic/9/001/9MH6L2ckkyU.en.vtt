quickly<00:01:59.999> how<00:02:00.359> to<00:02:00.390> set<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.679> so

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
quickly how to set this up it's so

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.380 
quickly how to set this up it's so
simple<00:02:02.700> we're<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.310> HDMI<00:02:05.310> video<00:02:06.149> out

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
simple we're going to do HDMI video out

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
simple we're going to do HDMI video out
from<00:02:07.319> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
from the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260 
from the
the<00:02:09.600> Amazon<00:02:10.050> fire<00:02:10.740> TV<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.850> see<00:02:12.030> there

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the Amazon fire TV as you can see there

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.910 
the Amazon fire TV as you can see there
we're<00:02:12.810> gonna<00:02:12.960> take<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> other<00:02:13.320> end<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.770> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
we're gonna take the other end of that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.580 
we're gonna take the other end of that
HDMI<00:02:14.490> cord<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.510> we're<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> simply<00:02:16.290> plug

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
HDMI cord and we're going to simply plug

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
HDMI cord and we're going to simply plug
it<00:02:16.800> into<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.550> HDMI<00:02:18.060> input<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.230> HD<00:02:19.620> PVR

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.320 
it into the HDMI input on the HD PVR
rocket<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.160> video<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.820> out<00:02:24.090> of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
rocket so now we have video going out of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.640 
rocket so now we have video going out of
the<00:02:24.840> fire<00:02:25.260> TV<00:02:25.530> into<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> HD<00:02:26.550> PVR<00:02:26.730> rocket<00:02:27.650> then

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the fire TV into the HD PVR rocket then

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.650 
the fire TV into the HD PVR rocket then
we're<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> take<00:02:29.130> our<00:02:29.310> second<00:02:29.820> HDMI<00:02:30.000> cord

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
we're going to take our second HDMI cord

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.290 
we're going to take our second HDMI cord
and<00:02:31.440> we're<00:02:31.620> going<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.830> plug<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.640> HDMI

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
on our television which is off screen so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.360 
on our television which is off screen so
now<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:49.110> our<00:02:49.140> video<00:02:49.620> signal<00:02:50.070> simply

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
now we have our video signal simply

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.160 
now we have our video signal simply

for since the HD PVR rocket does require

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.240 
for since the HD PVR rocket does require
quite<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.090> bit<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.360> power<00:03:30.510> when<00:03:30.810> recording<00:03:31.250> it

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
quite a bit of power when recording it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.430 
quite a bit of power when recording it
actually<00:03:32.580> allows<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.990> want<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.320> plug

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
into the wall and I would insert just

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
into the wall and I would insert just
this<00:03:51.990> one<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.440> into<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.010> power<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.430> HD<00:03:53.700> PVR

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.390 
this one and into it to power the HD PVR
rocket<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:55.290> might<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.560> asking<00:03:55.950> why<00:03:56.100> don't<00:03:56.310> we

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
rocket you might be asking why don't we

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.180 
rocket you might be asking why don't we
use<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> one<00:03:56.820> on<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.090> back<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.190> Kindle

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
use the one on the back of the Kindle

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.430 
use the one on the back of the Kindle
Fire<00:03:59.220> TV<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.390> simply<00:04:00.630> because<00:04:00.870> this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
Fire TV and that is simply because this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.230 
Fire TV and that is simply because this
is<00:04:01.620> not<00:04:01.740> designed<00:04:02.070> for<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.370> power<00:04:02.640> port<00:04:02.970> but

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
is not designed for a power port but

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.479 
is not designed for a power port but
mostly<00:04:03.630> for<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.930> data<00:04:04.140> port<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.950> what<00:04:05.400> will

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
mostly for a data port and what will

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.220 
mostly for a data port and what will
happen<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.239> power<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.840> HD<00:04:07.200> PVR

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
happen is it will power the HD PVR

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.979 
happen is it will power the HD PVR
rocket<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.209> can<00:04:09.390> see<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.750> pass-through

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
rocket so you can see the pass-through

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.479 
rocket so you can see the pass-through
video<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.770> but<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.100> once<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.400> start

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
video the but then once you start

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.340 
video the but then once you start
recording<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.390> does<00:04:12.600> take<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> little<00:04:13.140> bit<00:04:13.260> more

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
recording it does take a little bit more

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.400 
recording it does take a little bit more
power<00:04:13.709> draw<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.540> what<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.690> means<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.200> it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
power draw and what that means is it

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.900 
power draw and what that means is it
will<00:04:16.560> kind<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.859> disrupt<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> video<00:04:17.640> signal

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
will kind of disrupt the video signal

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.909 
will kind of disrupt the video signal
coming<00:04:18.359> out<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
coming out of
