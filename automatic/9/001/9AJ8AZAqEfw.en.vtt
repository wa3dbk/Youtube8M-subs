my<00:01:03.100> horse<00:01:03.640> went<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:04.030> my<00:01:04.119> plug<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.540> broke<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
my horse went on my plug is broke so I

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.499 
my horse went on my plug is broke so I
don't<00:01:06.670> know<00:01:06.729> how<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.909> make<00:01:07.030> them<00:01:07.149> good<00:01:07.240> enough

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
don't know how to make them good enough

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.940 
don't know how to make them good enough
connection<00:01:09.000> broke<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:11.409> with<00:01:11.500> Ming<00:01:11.710> good

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
connection broke I don't with Ming good

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.520 
connection broke I don't with Ming good
enough<00:01:12.130> connection<00:01:12.580> forcing<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.530> Sharks

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530

let's<00:01:14.770> mode<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.250> little<00:01:15.520> bit<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.700> gas<00:01:18.479> dryer

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
let's mode a little bit of gas dryer

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:37.169 
let's mode a little bit of gas dryer
again<00:01:35.039> maybe<00:01:36.039> it's<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.280> big<00:01:36.460> ass<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.909> don't<00:01:37.090> know

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
again maybe it's a big ass I don't know

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.080 
again maybe it's a big ass I don't know
I<00:01:37.390> think<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.960> might<00:01:38.049> not<00:01:38.110> be<00:01:38.229> getting<00:01:38.380> spark<00:01:38.799> Oh

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I think it might not be getting spark Oh

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.529 
I think it might not be getting spark Oh
we'll<00:01:40.090> take<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> look<00:01:40.390> at<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.569> spark<00:01:40.810> plug<00:01:41.520> took

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
we'll take a look at the spark plug took

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.149 
we'll take a look at the spark plug took
the<00:01:43.539> spark<00:01:43.810> plug<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.259> was<00:01:44.380> dry<00:01:44.590> but<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.069> is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
the spark plug it was dry but it is

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.169 
the spark plug it was dry but it is
sparking<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:47.679> don't<00:01:47.979> know<00:01:48.039> maybe<00:01:48.310> maybe

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
sparking so I don't know maybe maybe

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.649 
sparking so I don't know maybe maybe
it's<00:01:49.450> at<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.630> gas<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.670> try<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.789> again<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.299> think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
it's at a gas but try it again I think

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's at a gas but try it again I think

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.260 

I<00:02:14.500> wanna<00:02:15.500> see<00:02:15.740> if<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.370> out<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.610> gas<00:02:16.880> maybe

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
I wanna see if it is out of gas maybe

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.530 
I wanna see if it is out of gas maybe
I'll<00:02:18.200> put<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> little<00:02:18.590> guy<00:02:18.800> straight<00:02:19.100> into<00:02:19.490> the

I'll put a little guy straight into the

hang<00:02:23.410> poured<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.500> little<00:02:24.590> gas<00:02:24.890> straight<00:02:25.280> down

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
hang poured a little gas straight down

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.820 
hang poured a little gas straight down
into<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.700> carburetor<00:02:26.440> don't<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.740> if

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
into the carburetor don't want to see if

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:40.530 
into the carburetor don't want to see if
he'll<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.070> kick<00:02:28.310> over<00:02:35.860> yes<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.070> kicked<00:02:37.280> over

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.580 

must<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.050> gas<00:02:44.290> put<00:02:45.290> some<00:02:45.440> gas

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
must for your side of gas put some gas

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.820 
must for your side of gas put some gas
in<00:02:45.650> there<00:02:45.980> now<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:47.450> was<00:02:47.630> pretty<00:02:48.080> low<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.650> I

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
in there now it was pretty low so I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.990 
in there now it was pretty low so I
think<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.070> might<00:02:49.280> any<00:02:49.520> reason<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.850> not

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000
