very<00:02:33.700> fine<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.349> that's<00:02:35.799> current

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
well we just had a quick look at this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.000 
well we just had a quick look at this
camera<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.110> canon<00:02:55.710> g1x<00:02:57.260> which<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.470> third<00:02:58.800> for

advanced users or professional and that
want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.400> use<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> compact<00:03:03.000> camera<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.350> way

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
want to use a compact camera in this way

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.740 
want to use a compact camera in this way
it's<00:03:04.800> really<00:03:05.190> thought<00:03:05.520> for<00:03:05.910> its<00:03:06.150> apps<00:03:06.330> user<00:03:06.569> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's really thought for its apps user I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.740 
it's really thought for its apps user I
mean<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.170> use<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.800> route<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:09.570> can

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
mean you can use it in route you can

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.500 
mean you can use it in route you can
also<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.380> mean<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.040> buttons<00:03:11.430> are<00:03:11.640> well

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
also I mean all the buttons are well

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.510 
also I mean all the buttons are well
located<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.040> exposure

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
located like here you have exposure

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.710 
located like here you have exposure
compensation<00:03:15.709> exposure<00:03:16.709> locking<00:03:17.720> selection

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
compensation exposure locking selection

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
compensation exposure locking selection
of<00:03:18.870> auto<00:03:19.140> focus<00:03:19.620> points<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.560> way<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.800> measure

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
of auto focus points the way you measure

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.449 
of auto focus points the way you measure
the<00:03:23.610> light<00:03:23.790> like<00:03:24.720> central<00:03:25.680> spots<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.310> all

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the light like central spots and all

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.250 
the light like central spots and all
this<00:03:27.320> yes<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.640> move<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.230> screen<00:03:31.640> yes<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
this yes you can move the screen yes the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.280 
this yes you can move the screen yes the
diopter<00:03:34.260> directory<00:03:35.540> adjustment<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:37.080> a

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
diopter directory adjustment you have a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.740 
diopter directory adjustment you have a
mini<00:03:37.620> flash<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.060> really<00:03:39.300> useful

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
mini flash which is that really useful

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.949 
mini flash which is that really useful
unless<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.800> want<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.160> use<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:42.300> trigger<00:03:42.630> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
unless you want to use it to trigger a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.240 
unless you want to use it to trigger a
slave<00:03:43.709> flash<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:45.350> what<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.380> say<00:03:46.769> well<00:03:47.040> it's

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
slave flash and what I say well it's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.400 
slave flash and what I say well it's
well<00:03:47.640> thought<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.630> small<00:03:48.930> its<00:03:49.230> compact

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
well thought it's it's small its compact

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.380 
well thought it's it's small its compact
it's<00:03:50.010> easy<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.519> use<00:03:50.840> but<00:03:51.840> what<00:03:52.850> what<00:03:53.850> there's

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
it's easy to use but what what there's

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.120 
it's easy to use but what what there's
two<00:03:54.720> things<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.050> did<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.470> really<00:03:55.739> really

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
two things that did not really really

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.430 
two things that did not really really
like<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.940> could<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:58.110> very

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
like you could see that it's very

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.509 
like you could see that it's very
sensitive<00:03:59.310> to<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:01.079> flickering<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.860> of

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
sensitive to the flickering of the of

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.800 
sensitive to the flickering of the of
the<00:04:02.850> light<00:04:03.090> tubes<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:04.640> also<00:04:05.640> when<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.420> look<00:04:06.660> at

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the light tubes and also when I look at

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.190 
the light tubes and also when I look at
the<00:04:06.930> aperture<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.880> really<00:04:09.239> not<00:04:10.140> too

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
the aperture it's it's really not too

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560 
the aperture it's it's really not too
good<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> mean<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.950> starts<00:04:11.250> at<00:04:11.370> 2.8<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.420> said

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
good I mean it starts at 2.8 so you said

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.720 
good I mean it starts at 2.8 so you said
well<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:12.959> like<00:04:13.200> that's<00:04:13.769> nice<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.519> lens

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
well that's like that's nice the lens

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.180 
well that's like that's nice the lens
very<00:04:15.390> quickly<00:04:15.870> when<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.350> use<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> zoom<00:04:16.919> it

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
very quickly when you use the zoom it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.900 
very quickly when you use the zoom it
goes<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.700> 5.8<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.260> think<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.280> range<00:04:20.640> of

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
goes to 5.8 and I think in this range of

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.950 
goes to 5.8 and I think in this range of
product<00:04:21.680> people<00:04:22.680> expect<00:04:23.190> more<00:04:23.430> luminous

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
product people expect more luminous

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.110 
product people expect more luminous
lenses<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.340> especially<00:04:26.340> when<00:04:26.610> canon<00:04:26.970> has

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
lenses and especially when canon has

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.409 
lenses and especially when canon has
other<00:04:27.990> other<00:04:28.890> products<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:30.000> have<00:04:30.260> more<00:04:32.419> more

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
other other products that have more more

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.409 
other other products that have more more
luminous<00:04:33.780> lenses<00:04:34.260> or<00:04:34.380> starting<00:04:34.890> at<00:04:35.010> 2.22<00:04:35.880> the

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
luminous lenses or starting at 2.22 the

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.830 
luminous lenses or starting at 2.22 the
2.0<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.979> think<00:04:38.460> they<00:04:38.940> should<00:04:39.390> better<00:04:39.570> this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
2.0 so I think they should better this

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.810 
2.0 so I think they should better this
but<00:04:40.380> well<00:04:40.560> that's<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.950> nice<00:04:41.070> camera<00:04:41.370> that's<00:04:41.729> a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
but well that's a nice camera that's a

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.940 
but well that's a nice camera that's a
kind<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.060> camera<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.630> pro<00:04:42.990> would<00:04:43.020> use<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.740> go<00:04:43.890> on

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
kind of camera a pro would use to go on

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.840 
kind of camera a pro would use to go on
holidays<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:45.080> vacation<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:47.340> make<00:04:47.640> some

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
holidays and vacation and then make some

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.760 
holidays and vacation and then make some
bitches<00:04:48.240> knowing<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.960> they<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.260> edit<00:04:49.530> it

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
bitches knowing that they can edit it

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.580 
bitches knowing that they can edit it
out<00:04:49.919> edit<00:04:50.490> them<00:04:50.789> after<00:04:51.270> because<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.990> raffle

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
out edit them after because the raffle

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.850 
out edit them after because the raffle
are<00:04:52.770> really<00:04:53.100> good<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:54.419> think<00:04:55.289> this<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.440> so

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
are really good and I think this is so

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.310 
are really good and I think this is so
for<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.220> when<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.270> don't<00:04:57.510> know<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:58.110> don't

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
for this when you don't know you don't

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.030 
for this when you don't know you don't
give<00:04:58.500> priority<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.820> mega<00:05:00.150> zoom

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
give priority to to mega zoom

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.220 
give priority to to mega zoom
many<00:05:01.340> people<00:05:01.490> are<00:05:01.760> one<00:05:02.060> thing<00:05:02.270> now<00:05:02.510> but<00:05:03.110> they

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
many people are one thing now but they

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.140 
many people are one thing now but they
won't<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.680> give<00:05:03.860> priority<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.400> making<00:05:05.030> the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
won't you give priority to making the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.200 
won't you give priority to making the
picture<00:05:05.570> with<00:05:06.110> with<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.860> same<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.490> lens

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
picture with with the same kind of lens
