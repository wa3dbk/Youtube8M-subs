opinion but anyways let's go ahead and
talk<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> deck<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.619> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
talk about the deck a little bit so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.800

the<00:01:42.930> spirit<00:01:43.229> beasts<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> tamers<00:01:43.890> open<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the spirit beasts the tamers open up the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.249 
the spirit beasts the tamers open up the
combos<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.390> card<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.689> normal<00:01:46.049> 7

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259

special<00:01:49.439> summon<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.549> basic

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
special summon so that's the basic

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.200 
special summon so that's the basic
concept<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> deck<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.520> beast<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
most part to get a little bit of free

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
most part to get a little bit of free
advantage<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.490> basically<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.030> lets

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
advantage this one basically just lets

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.730

plans<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.819> one<00:02:49.000> harpies<00:02:49.540> hunting<00:02:49.840> ground<00:02:50.049> it's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
plans in one harpies hunting ground it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.960 
plans in one harpies hunting ground it's
nice<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.590> feel<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> popular<00:02:51.519> one<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.849> your

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
nice just feel the popular one of your

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.160 
nice just feel the popular one of your
opponent's<00:02:52.269> back<00:02:52.390> row<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.750> then<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.049> know

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
opponent's back row and then you know

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.869 
opponent's back row and then you know
tactically<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.769> for<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> play<00:02:54.160> anyway<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.549> I

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
tactically go for a play anyway so I

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.460 
tactically go for a play anyway so I
think<00:02:55.299> that's<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.690> he's<00:02:55.780> basically<00:02:56.079> using

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
think that's what he's basically using

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.170 
think that's what he's basically using
the<00:02:56.560> form<00:02:56.769> but<00:02:57.190> more<00:02:57.340> likely<00:02:57.579> it's<00:02:57.849> just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the form but more likely it's just

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.119 
the form but more likely it's just
because<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.840> effect<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.950> out

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
because of that effect that is just out

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.710 
because of that effect that is just out
of<00:03:00.340> control<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.879> those<00:03:01.000> Beckett's<00:03:01.329> one

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
of control with those Beckett's one

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.030 
of control with those Beckett's one
sprint<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.079> face-up<00:03:02.349> one<00:03:02.620> monster<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:02.950> control

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
sprint a face-up one monster you control

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.400 
sprint a face-up one monster you control
returns<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.910> hand<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.810> spot<00:03:04.989> someone

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
returns to the hand you can spot someone

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.900 
returns to the hand you can spot someone
level<00:03:05.680> 40<00:03:05.890> winged<00:03:06.280> monster<00:03:06.640> from<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:06.790> deck

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
level 40 winged monster from your deck

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.640 
level 40 winged monster from your deck
so<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.120> basically<00:03:07.299> means<00:03:07.629> special<00:03:08.379> summon

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so that basically means special summon

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.110 
so that basically means special summon
your<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.129> your<00:03:09.160> go-to<00:03:09.489> cards<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
your you know your go-to cards in the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.630 
your you know your go-to cards in the
deck<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.480> think<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:12.280> crazy

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
deck I think if that is is really crazy

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.190 
deck I think if that is is really crazy
because<00:03:12.849> it's<00:03:13.060> four<00:03:13.329> or<00:03:13.540> lower<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.109> which

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
because it's four or lower like it which

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.539 
because it's four or lower like it which
is<00:03:14.319> four<00:03:14.530> then<00:03:14.739> you'd<00:03:14.859> be<00:03:15.040> limited<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.430> it's

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
is four then you'd be limited but it's

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.890 
is four then you'd be limited but it's
like<00:03:15.670> four<00:03:15.849> lower<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.269> pretty<00:03:16.629> much

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
like four lower so that pretty much

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.720 
like four lower so that pretty much
covers<00:03:17.260> everything<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:18.130> mean<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> don't<00:03:18.579> know<00:03:18.639> if

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
covers everything I mean I don't know if

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.500 
covers everything I mean I don't know if
they're<00:03:18.880> going<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.060> be<00:03:19.120> coming<00:03:19.269> out<00:03:19.480> with

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
they're going to be coming out with

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.300 
they're going to be coming out with
other<00:03:19.810> ones<00:03:20.169> that<00:03:20.380> are<00:03:20.560> all<00:03:20.799> wind<00:03:21.069> in<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
other ones that are all wind in the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.920 
other ones that are all wind in the
future<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:22.209> most<00:03:22.329> part<00:03:22.540> that's<00:03:22.690> pretty

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
future but the most part that's pretty

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.330 
future but the most part that's pretty
much<00:03:23.049> special<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.709> anything<00:03:23.859> from<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.190> deck

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
much special in anything from the deck

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.120 
much special in anything from the deck
that's<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.970> pretty<00:03:25.599> insane<00:03:26.139> effect<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.919> you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's a pretty insane effect as you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.589 
that's a pretty insane effect as you
guys<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.760> mean<00:03:28.120> special<00:03:28.359> something

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
guys know I mean special something

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.809 
guys know I mean special something
anything<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.230> pretty<00:03:29.380> self-explanatory

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
anything it's pretty self-explanatory

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.400 
anything it's pretty self-explanatory
and<00:03:30.819> then<00:03:31.180> he's<00:03:31.269> also<00:03:31.450> got<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> rent<00:03:31.930> random

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and then he's also got the rent random

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.720 
and then he's also got the rent random
heart<00:03:32.590> beats<00:03:32.739> under<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.370> said<00:03:33.579> pop

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
heart beats under just like I said pop

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.370 
heart beats under just like I said pop
back<00:03:33.910> Republic<00:03:34.359> helps<00:03:34.569> out<00:03:34.720> doesn't<00:03:35.290> make

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
back Republic helps out doesn't make

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.960 
back Republic helps out doesn't make
this<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.620> dancer<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.340> has<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> little<00:03:36.790> bit<00:03:36.880> more

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
this a dancer it has a little bit more

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.150 
this a dancer it has a little bit more
utility<00:03:37.389> if<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.959> gets<00:03:38.230> divine<00:03:38.950> one

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
utility if it gets divine one

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.890 
utility if it gets divine one
misspelling<00:03:39.880> gets<00:03:40.030> wrecked<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.569> still<00:03:40.780> have

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
misspelling gets wrecked you still have

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.330 
misspelling gets wrecked you still have
the<00:03:40.959> option<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.530> go<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:44.290> free<00:03:44.530> macro<00:03:44.919> pubs

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
the option to go for so free macro pubs

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.530 
the option to go for so free macro pubs
before<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:45.849> in<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.000> your<00:03:46.060> place<00:03:46.239> anyways

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
before you go in for your place anyways

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.449 
before you go in for your place anyways
so<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.660> think<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.989> was<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.530> utility<00:03:48.340> with

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
so I think that was the utility with

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.069 
so I think that was the utility with
that<00:03:48.549> card<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.239> really<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.660> comes<00:03:49.750> down<00:03:49.900> to

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
that card but really it comes down to

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.930 
that card but really it comes down to
combination<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.739> Calvary<00:03:51.160> calories

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
combination and Calvary calories

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.610 
combination and Calvary calories
basically<00:03:52.389> like<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> Gardens<00:03:52.989> eCall<00:03:53.319> bridge

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
basically like a Gardens eCall bridge

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.520 
basically like a Gardens eCall bridge
brings<00:03:53.829> back<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.190> monsters<00:03:54.840> but<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.500> thing

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
brings back to monsters but the thing

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.839 
brings back to monsters but the thing
with<00:03:56.799> Calvary's<00:03:57.250> you're<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.549> going<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:57.760> have

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
with Calvary's you're not going to have

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.640 
with Calvary's you're not going to have
to<00:03:58.030> require<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.450> have<00:03:58.569> like<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.810> face-up<00:03:59.049> in<00:03:59.290> wax

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
to require to have like a face-up in wax

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.069 
to require to have like a face-up in wax
saber<00:03:59.889> or<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.609> face-up<00:04:00.790> spirit<00:04:01.660> be<00:04:01.810> still<00:04:02.019> I

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
saber or like face-up spirit be still I

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.119 
saber or like face-up spirit be still I
think<00:04:02.139> that's<00:04:02.349> really<00:04:02.560> good<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.069> little

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
think that's really good it's a little

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.349 
think that's really good it's a little
bit<00:04:03.310> different<00:04:03.579> but<00:04:03.669> for<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.879> most<00:04:04.030> part<00:04:04.120> it's

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
bit different but for the most part it's

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.729 
bit different but for the most part it's
just<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.599> special<00:04:04.989> summon<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.379> then<00:04:05.680> you

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
just like special summon and then you

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.470 
just like special summon and then you
can<00:04:05.859> go<00:04:05.950> for<00:04:06.040> your<00:04:06.160> contact<00:04:06.459> fusion<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.940> then

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
can go for your contact fusion and then

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.420

is it's really annoying because you got
to<00:06:56.979> go<00:06:57.069> fast<00:06:57.310> against<00:06:57.580> that<00:06:57.759> deck<00:06:57.939> as<00:06:58.569> quickly

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
to go fast against that deck as quickly

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.089 
to go fast against that deck as quickly
as<00:06:59.020> possible<00:06:59.349> otherwise<00:06:59.439> they're<00:06:59.889> just<00:06:59.919> going

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
as possible otherwise they're just going

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.439 
as possible otherwise they're just going
to<00:07:00.189> have<00:07:00.280> like<00:07:00.460> Manish<00:07:00.759> cards<00:07:01.030> for<00:07:01.210> days<00:07:01.360> and

to have like Manish cards for days and

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.480 
to have like Manish cards for days and
they<00:07:01.539> can<00:07:01.689> keep<00:07:01.870> on<00:07:01.990> recycling<00:07:02.530> because<00:07:02.979> the

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
they can keep on recycling because the

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.159 
they can keep on recycling because the
cavalry<00:07:03.909> is<00:07:03.939> such<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.240> strong<00:07:04.509> card<00:07:04.780> but<00:07:05.020> for

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
cavalry is such a strong card but for

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.129 
cavalry is such a strong card but for
the<00:07:05.259> most<00:07:05.379> part<00:07:05.469> guys<00:07:05.680> this<00:07:06.250> deck<00:07:06.460> is<00:07:06.639> I<00:07:07.449> would

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139 
the most part guys this deck is I would

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.020 
the most part guys this deck is I would
say<00:07:08.379> it's<00:07:08.650> a<00:07:08.860> deck<00:07:09.099> that<00:07:09.129> doesn't<00:07:09.789> revolve

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
say it's a deck that doesn't revolve

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.529 
say it's a deck that doesn't revolve
around<00:07:10.349> an<00:07:11.610> otk<00:07:12.610> I<00:07:12.969> was<00:07:13.210> thinking<00:07:13.509> that

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
around an otk I was thinking that

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:14.969 
around an otk I was thinking that
perhaps<00:07:13.900> if<00:07:14.259> you<00:07:14.379> can<00:07:14.500> keep<00:07:14.590> on<00:07:14.740> swapping

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
perhaps if you can keep on swapping

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.850 
perhaps if you can keep on swapping
monsters<00:07:15.550> you<00:07:16.240> can<00:07:16.870> otk<00:07:17.229> little<00:07:17.500> equip<00:07:17.680> but

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
monsters you can otk little equip but

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.800 
monsters you can otk little equip but
it's<00:07:17.949> not<00:07:18.099> technically<00:07:18.669> an<00:07:18.759> otk<00:07:19.029> deck<00:07:19.300> it's<00:07:19.719> a

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
it's not technically an otk deck it's a

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.390 
it's not technically an otk deck it's a
lot<00:07:19.930> of<00:07:20.080> free<00:07:20.349> advantage<00:07:21.039> at<00:07:21.219> the<00:07:21.370> moment

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
lot of free advantage at the moment

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.980 
lot of free advantage at the moment
that's<00:07:21.819> that's<00:07:22.150> the<00:07:22.240> way<00:07:22.360> I<00:07:22.389> see<00:07:22.659> this<00:07:22.779> deck
