Amazon it comes with a couple different

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.380 
Amazon it comes with a couple different

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
I think four or five different sand

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
I think four or five different sand
papers<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> begin<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> first<00:01:46.649> set

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
papers to begin with in the first set

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
papers to begin with in the first set
and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.880> buy<00:01:48.000> additional<00:01:48.180> ones<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and then you can buy additional ones and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.440 
and then you can buy additional ones and
I've<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.420> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I've actually think one of the one of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
I've actually think one of the one of
the<00:01:51.659> original<00:01:52.079> pac----<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.759> 220<00:01:53.759> grit<00:01:54.470> 220

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the original pac---- is 220 grit 220

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.240 
the original pac---- is 220 grit 220
grit<00:01:55.969> well<00:01:56.969> used<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> water<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
grit well used with with the water and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.719 
grit well used with with the water and
on<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> whatever<00:02:00.630> scrap<00:02:01.439> metal<00:02:01.740> stuff<00:02:02.070> gets

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
on the whatever scrap metal stuff gets

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.510 
on the whatever scrap metal stuff gets
so<00:02:03.030> nice<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.689> fine<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.740> sand<00:02:05.250> paper

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so nice and fine that you get sand paper

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.350 
so nice and fine that you get sand paper
of<00:02:05.990> probably<00:02:06.990> around<00:02:07.140> 4<00:02:07.619> maybe<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.369> 600<00:02:09.090> grit

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of probably around 4 maybe on 600 grit

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.500 
of probably around 4 maybe on 600 grit
so<00:02:09.899> good<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.890> decent<00:02:11.099> nice

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.870 

then<00:03:04.440> our<00:03:06.980> starts<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.190> spinning<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.790> me<00:03:08.970> now

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
then our starts I'm spinning on me now

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.520 
then our starts I'm spinning on me now
switch<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.270> spin<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> left<00:03:12.750> spin<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.440> do

switch the spin to the left spin and do

00:03:13.530 --> 00:04:11.460 
switch the spin to the left spin and do
the<00:03:13.650> other<00:03:13.800> side

can see right there but we're gonna take
it<00:04:26.000> two<00:04:26.210> more<00:04:26.449> steps<00:04:26.720> further<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.680> doesn't

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
it two more steps further that doesn't

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.460 
it two more steps further that doesn't
take<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> lot<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.669> lot<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.970> time<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.389> skill<00:04:29.780> and

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.790 

and<00:05:58.159> how<00:05:59.159> long<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.699> is<00:05:59.729> five<00:06:00.720> minutes<00:06:01.020> okay<00:06:01.530> I

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
and how long it is five minutes okay I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.200 
and how long it is five minutes okay I
was<00:06:01.949> talking<00:06:02.370> probably<00:06:02.550> more<00:06:02.819> than<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.060> was

you do it easy you train on your cheap
knives<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.470> I'm<00:06:37.650> actually<00:06:37.830> doing<00:06:38.130> my

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
knives and I'm actually doing my

knives and I'm actually doing my
expensive<00:06:38.940> knife<00:06:39.120> this<00:06:39.389> way<00:06:39.449> just<00:06:40.199> because

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
expensive knife this way just because

expensive knife this way just because
convex<00:06:41.940> edge<00:06:42.120> is<00:06:42.569> a<00:06:42.630> little<00:06:42.900> a<00:06:43.259> little<00:06:43.409> more

convex edge is a little a little more

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.790 
convex edge is a little a little more
you<00:06:44.430> get<00:06:44.580> much<00:06:44.849> more<00:06:44.880> strength<00:06:45.509> out<00:06:45.900> of<00:06:46.139> you

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
you get much more strength out of you

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.589 
you get much more strength out of you
know<00:06:46.949> it's<00:06:47.129> same<00:06:47.430> sharp<00:06:47.759> as<00:06:47.940> any<00:06:48.180> other<00:06:48.389> edge

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
know it's same sharp as any other edge

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.279 
know it's same sharp as any other edge
but<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.379> just<00:06:49.819> some<00:06:50.819> of<00:06:50.909> the<00:06:51.030> knives<00:06:51.240> they<00:06:52.110> can

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
but it just some of the knives they can

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.800 
but it just some of the knives they can
chip<00:06:52.500> on<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:52.889> and<00:06:53.280> stuff<00:06:53.490> like<00:06:53.639> that<00:06:53.909> so<00:06:54.569> that

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
chip on you and stuff like that so that

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.749 
chip on you and stuff like that so that
convex<00:06:55.590> edge<00:06:55.940> is<00:06:56.940> a<00:06:57.360> little<00:06:57.750> bit<00:06:58.069> so<00:06:59.069> and<00:06:59.520> as

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
convex edge is a little bit so and as

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.110 
convex edge is a little bit so and as
you<00:06:59.789> do<00:07:00.060> it<00:07:00.180> on<00:07:00.330> that<00:07:00.449> phone<00:07:01.250> it<00:07:02.250> it<00:07:02.580> copies<00:07:03.090> the

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
you do it on that phone it it copies the

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.899 
you do it on that phone it it copies the
edge<00:07:03.360> and<00:07:03.659> the<00:07:03.750> rounds<00:07:04.080> of<00:07:04.169> the<00:07:04.520> edges<00:07:05.520> of<00:07:05.729> the

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
edge and the rounds of the edges of the

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.180 
edge and the rounds of the edges of the
of<00:07:06.210> the<00:07:06.479> transitions<00:07:07.259> between<00:07:07.469> the<00:07:07.710> secondary

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
of the transitions between the secondary

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.450 
of the transitions between the secondary
bevel<00:07:08.940> by<00:07:09.779> about<00:07:09.960> primary<00:07:10.500> bevel<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:11.039> some<00:07:11.370> of

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
bevel by about primary bevel and some of

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.230 
bevel by about primary bevel and some of
them<00:07:11.580> even<00:07:11.669> that<00:07:11.969> the<00:07:12.719> third<00:07:13.050> bell<00:07:13.909> so<00:07:14.909> it<00:07:15.060> will

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
them even that the third bell so it will

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.360 
them even that the third bell so it will
round<00:07:15.479> it<00:07:15.630> off<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.199> you<00:07:16.680> know<00:07:16.800> if<00:07:17.009> you<00:07:17.130> do<00:07:17.250> it

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
round it off and you know if you do it

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.370 
round it off and you know if you do it
sometimes<00:07:18.180> don't<00:07:18.479> even<00:07:18.750> have<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:18.990> first<00:07:19.169> time

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
sometimes don't even have the first time

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.050 
sometimes don't even have the first time
you<00:07:19.529> already<00:07:19.800> have<00:07:19.979> a<00:07:20.009> nice<00:07:20.279> convex<00:07:20.940> edge

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
you already have a nice convex edge

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.689 
you already have a nice convex edge
sometimes<00:07:21.659> it<00:07:21.960> will<00:07:22.110> take<00:07:22.289> more<00:07:22.529> you<00:07:22.740> know<00:07:22.889> so

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
sometimes it will take more you know so

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.519 
sometimes it will take more you know so
it's<00:07:24.360> up<00:07:24.479> to<00:07:24.659> you<00:07:24.779> you<00:07:24.810> know<00:07:25.110> how<00:07:25.289> much<00:07:25.440> you

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529 
it's up to you you know how much you

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.320 
it's up to you you know how much you
want<00:07:25.680> to<00:07:25.740> take<00:07:25.889> off<00:07:26.069> the<00:07:26.250> how<00:07:26.610> much<00:07:26.759> metal<00:07:27.060> you

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
want to take off the how much metal you

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.820 
want to take off the how much metal you
want<00:07:27.479> to<00:07:27.539> take<00:07:27.690> off<00:07:27.900> it<00:07:28.050> really<00:07:28.289> doesn't<00:07:28.800> take

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
want to take off it really doesn't take

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.490 
want to take off it really doesn't take
much<00:07:29.009> it<00:07:29.759> literally<00:07:30.270> just<00:07:30.389> sharpens<00:07:31.139> it<00:07:31.289> and

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
much it literally just sharpens it and

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.649 
much it literally just sharpens it and
rounds<00:07:32.099> out<00:07:32.159> the<00:07:32.310> edges<00:07:32.699> so<00:07:32.940> eventually<00:07:33.539> you

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:33.659 
rounds out the edges so eventually you

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:36.080 
rounds out the edges so eventually you
will<00:07:33.810> end<00:07:33.960> a<00:07:34.050> bit<00:07:34.229> perfect<00:07:34.469> convex<00:07:35.130> edge<00:07:35.279> it's

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
will end a bit perfect convex edge it's

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.300 
will end a bit perfect convex edge it's
very<00:07:36.360> easy<00:07:36.630> you<00:07:36.960> don't<00:07:37.139> have<00:07:37.229> to<00:07:37.469> pay<00:07:37.979> so<00:07:38.250> much

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
very easy you don't have to pay so much

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.219 
very easy you don't have to pay so much
attention<00:07:38.430> to<00:07:38.940> the<00:07:39.060> angle<00:07:39.389> just<00:07:39.810> because<00:07:40.110> of

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:40.229 
attention to the angle just because of

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:42.890 
attention to the angle just because of
the<00:07:40.349> foam<00:07:40.590> will<00:07:40.830> copy<00:07:41.159> the<00:07:42.090> whole<00:07:42.240> overall

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
the foam will copy the whole overall

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.890 
the foam will copy the whole overall
shape<00:07:43.199> of<00:07:43.440> the<00:07:43.770> of<00:07:43.949> the<00:07:44.159> secondary<00:07:44.639> bevel<00:07:44.900> and

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
shape of the of the secondary bevel and

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.230 
shape of the of the secondary bevel and
going<00:07:46.229> to<00:07:46.349> the<00:07:46.469> actual<00:07:46.710> cutting<00:07:46.919> edge<00:07:47.159> so<00:07:47.940> very

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
going to the actual cutting edge so very

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.110 
going to the actual cutting edge so very
easy<00:07:48.479> to<00:07:48.690> do<00:07:49.370> doesn't<00:07:50.370> take<00:07:50.639> a<00:07:50.669> lot<00:07:50.789> of<00:07:50.849> skill
