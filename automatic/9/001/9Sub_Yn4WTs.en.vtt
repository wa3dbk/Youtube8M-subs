you're<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.290> need<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.800> crank<00:00:50.160> up

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you're really going to need to crank up

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.569 
you're really going to need to crank up
your<00:00:50.430> AAA<00:00:50.989> because<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.920> crank<00:00:53.370> up

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
your AAA because if you don't crank up

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.060 
your AAA because if you don't crank up
the<00:00:53.790> AAA<00:00:54.000> you're<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.680> clear

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the AAA you're not going to get as clear

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.729 
settings are we going to need in order
to<00:02:48.760> generate<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.510> many<00:02:49.750> frames<00:02:50.079> on<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> single

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.759 

okay<00:03:03.069> what<00:03:03.909> I've<00:03:04.060> done<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.599> I've<00:03:04.900> gone<00:03:05.379> ahead<00:03:05.560> i

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
okay what I've done is I've gone ahead i

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.949 
okay what I've done is I've gone ahead i
went<00:03:06.129> into<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.400> nvidia<00:03:06.879> control<00:03:07.060> panel<00:03:07.359> i

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
went into the nvidia control panel i

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.319 
went into the nvidia control panel i
shut<00:03:08.260> off<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.620> multi<00:03:08.980> GPU<00:03:09.489> now<00:03:09.730> i'm<00:03:09.909> running

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
shut off the multi GPU now i'm running

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.289 
shut off the multi GPU now i'm running
just<00:03:10.569> one<00:03:11.019> GPU<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.099> a<00:03:12.129> which<00:03:12.879> is<00:03:12.939> it

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
just one GPU which is a which is it

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.209 
just one GPU which is a which is it
would<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.659> equivalent<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.590> gtx<00:03:15.189> 580<00:03:17.219> what

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
would be equivalent to the gtx 580 what

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.679 
would be equivalent to the gtx 580 what
I'm<00:03:18.969> planning<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.810> doing<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.379> showing<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:21.689> the

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
I'm planning on doing is showing you the

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.530 
I'm planning on doing is showing you the
difference<00:03:23.230> between<00:03:23.469> what<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> dual<00:03:24.790> GPU<00:03:25.329> can

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
difference between what a dual GPU can

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500 
difference between what a dual GPU can
do<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:26.079> high<00:03:26.409> levels<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.129> what<00:03:27.969> you<00:03:28.120> need<00:03:28.329> to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
do at high levels and what you need to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.809 
do at high levels and what you need to
do<00:03:28.889> for<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:30.219> single<00:03:30.849> GPU<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.599> order<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.079> get<00:03:32.439> or

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
achieve the same frame rates that you

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.409 
achieve the same frame rates that you
would<00:03:37.090> get<00:03:37.359> with<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.349> gtx<00:03:38.980> 590<00:03:39.669> with<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
would get with the gtx 590 with the

terrain the tessellation etc now I know

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.789

it's<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.359> apparent<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.169> you<00:03:50.469> right

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
it's not that apparent with you right

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.259 
it's not that apparent with you right
now<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:52.359> a<00:03:52.599> video<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:54.269> myself

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
now because it's a video but myself

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.629 
now because it's a video but myself
looking<00:03:56.169> at<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.859> had<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.340> change

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
looking at it because I had to change

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.569 
looking at it because I had to change
some<00:03:57.909> settings<00:03:58.329> too<00:03:58.569> low<00:03:58.750> i'm<00:03:59.169> only<00:03:59.349> at<00:03:59.530> 2x<00:04:00.189> AAA

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
some settings too low i'm only at 2x AAA

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.189 
some settings too low i'm only at 2x AAA
the<00:04:01.569> terrain<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.169> not<00:04:02.230> as<00:04:02.379> crisp<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.989> image

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
the terrain is not as crisp if the image

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.619 
the terrain is not as crisp if the image

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
quality is not as good the shadows

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.580

aren't<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.229> as<00:04:08.699> well<00:04:09.699> as<00:04:09.879> they<00:04:10.060> were<00:04:10.120> before<00:04:10.590> so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
aren't on as well as they were before so

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.390 
aren't on as well as they were before so
things<00:04:11.949> do<00:04:12.400> look<00:04:12.430> different<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:15.040> looks<00:04:15.280> a

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
things do look different and it looks a

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.060 
things do look different and it looks a
little<00:04:15.549> bit<00:04:15.819> more<00:04:16.120> grainy<00:04:16.630> now<00:04:17.409> it's<00:04:17.709> not<00:04:17.859> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
little bit more grainy now it's not to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.070 
little bit more grainy now it's not to
say<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.549> 580<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.269> any<00:04:19.479> slouch<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.169> is<00:04:20.530> the

say that the 580 is any slouch it is the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.219 
say that the 580 is any slouch it is the
