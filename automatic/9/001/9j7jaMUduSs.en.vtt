00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
only do it when you gotta fish only what

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.850 
only do it when you gotta fish only what

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
little hard to get we have to bring it

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.780 
little hard to get we have to bring it
into<00:06:03.390> the<00:06:03.540> states<00:06:03.930> because<00:06:04.550> one<00:06:05.550> company

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
into the states because one company

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.760

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
bought another company the only one who

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.380 
bought another company the only one who
got<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.130> dogs<00:06:08.370> they<00:06:08.730> don't<00:06:08.910> want<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.090> fixed

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
got the dogs they don't want the fixed

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.420 
got the dogs they don't want the fixed
up<00:06:09.570> so<00:06:09.840> they<00:06:10.500> don't<00:06:10.530> bring<00:06:10.800> in<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.040> fish<00:06:11.160> stuff

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
up so they don't bring in the fish stuff

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.740 
up so they don't bring in the fish stuff
anymore<00:06:11.700> they<00:06:12.000> won't<00:06:12.090> let<00:06:12.270> another<00:06:12.390> got<00:06:12.660> to

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
anymore they won't let another got to

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.860 
anymore they won't let another got to
bring<00:06:12.900> it<00:06:12.990> in<00:06:13.140> so<00:06:13.920> I<00:06:13.980> just<00:06:14.190> get<00:06:14.340> a<00:06:17.630> copper<00:06:18.630> state

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
bring it in so I just get a copper state

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.050 
bring it in so I just get a copper state
