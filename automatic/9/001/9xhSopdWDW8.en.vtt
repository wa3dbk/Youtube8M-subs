in<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.550> big<00:03:50.730> games<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.480> think<00:03:51.540> last<00:03:52.290> year

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
in the big games and I think last year

in the big games and I think last year
was<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.060> bad<00:03:54.360> deal<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.900> front

it<00:03:56.010> happens<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.490> course<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.180> change<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
it happens of course but we change the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.560 
it happens of course but we change the
way<00:03:58.830> we<00:03:58.860> play<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.310> what<00:03:59.820> they<00:03:59.970> try<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.210> cancel

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570
