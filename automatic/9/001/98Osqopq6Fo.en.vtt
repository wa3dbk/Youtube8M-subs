00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940
 indispensable 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 we buy the cable h 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920

 d the 40 minutes penélope 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 the option 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 in so much in quito 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 the lines with everything 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.510
 the pedestrian explained naciri 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.250
 on the part of the skinny

 astrid tequila super after relationships for example as in the logo 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.329
 which is below 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.809
 and something very important for example the office door unprecedented 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.369
 the 2012 and it is korda when appearing and final 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.100
 in the size television that we have it 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 the epic this could not be read precisely there is nothing 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.360
 and still to end the hdmi cable 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 he could read 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 and point alfonso king with some of the 30 years 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.650
 mahmud abás 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.730
 we have together 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.600
 the two - teams like that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910
 what did you do 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.120
 and avoid like tuenti 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.430
 here not because the play is something like 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.370
 I do not know 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.250
 a game of Caesar but admits that it is a giant as interesting because it takes the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.060
 concept that you are the one who manages people's lives and takes them to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 level 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.420
 finally the literal however you can arise your character from the xbox is 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.389
 a giant who handles things very literally 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.389
 Aronón's snow level the incomplete ones are based 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.649

 ping pong and simple 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.529
 celebration 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 It is a game that challenges normality 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.079
 then the incentives 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.049
 a powerful common box and if you write me a bit simple and common 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.650
 a level of demand montoya the minister 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 what does not seem very good 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 I learned it and I thought who Wednesday engels 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 believers and non-believers 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.199

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.199
 singler 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.010
 It's unique 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 precious by 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.979
 The only thing that I do not understand so far is equal parts 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.359
 has arrived the time of truth 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.259
 moratinos 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.259
 this plea 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.639
 it's very bad it's good 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.069
 if you have children 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.439
 was a night 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.439
 sao joao marisa fanlo mistreatment 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959

 the high official dn be in this team 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:55.709
 these low 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.029
 bellomo lists 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.749
 anything 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:59.649
 this hour 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:06.039
 the eu in this dance state ethyl and sixto yellow then there he met in 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.939
 bed 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.879
 there are even moments in which account for this edition is what 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.269
 we had done before 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.719
 mexico still 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.719
 the high definition console 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.020
 - accessible the prestige of three 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.270
 and that at the end of the original titles air exclusion is what interests us 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.189
 later 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.479
 specifically 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.599
 felisa cepeda 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.599
 because so far you can not get press port elizabeth 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.959
 then when we discovered that for him for his 13th anniversary also for the 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.520
 xbox 13 so many 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.809
 that marked a bit 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.009
 the idea that exaggerates the console experience we had 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.020
 I said that for the pp leaves for the period candles 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.139
 that was the console with good controls 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.349
 but it also has some problems 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.509
 said that these moments of the game mikel airbus starts to do 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.509
 sounds well you have to think 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.320
 valid comparison an animal dying in the kitchen 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.010
 all for the refrigerator when it's doing weird stuff and sweden 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.559
 or the bomb about to explode 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.319
 I do not know about port in itself perhaps courteous 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.509
 then he arrived and right now in addition a topic 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.590
 in the event when it charges for example they have towards Cuban music 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.039
 Polish politicians 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.909
 or Spain in Beijing 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.019
 at times when there are silences and suddenly the exhibition 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:42.559
 a micro and 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.900
 As for Guadalupe's virgin, the counselor is so good 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.169
 now this aspect can be countered slightly 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.639
 installing which 5 percent - fourth 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.599
 it's like the online filis 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.400
 I lived 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.380
 and the quality 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.100
 parga 20m lüthi will run much faster than they normally should 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.520
 turn 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.520
 it is true the island martínez director of vogue 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.860
 which is basically what gives you advantage supposedly playstation 3 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.409
 but frankly 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.460
 I think and we think attack 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.390
 is a very valid way to lower the prices of consoles sony follows 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.250
 losing money in order to defray until now have managed to get 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.069
 to a point of equilibrium with what he has invested for it to produce here three and 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.560
 the pretoria group shipper for much more and over companies at 12 35 in 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.809
 change masterson if you have had gains from art 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:39.719
 I think the image that it was possible to access even that 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:41.710
 13 60 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.819
 precisely for having nothing to do is not lower prices this week 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.310
 easy to get what not everything you could think that the Catalan club 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.080
 popular court and descendants 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.979
 the whole crew noticed 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.729
 two 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.699
 the speed of resolutions of the xbox 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.169
 may cause 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.749
 the cyclist 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:06.809
 this is the first game we had at the time to get the xbox to increase 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.119
 to the casting that are here 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.499
 i out there and pilieri and relatives had prescribed 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.809
 percent 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.649
 which has been long 

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.759
 50 hours 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.759
 buenos aires marcelo started to move forward 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.020
 since the xbox 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.020
 for the first time 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.580
 sometimes you lose one on the first disk 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.490
 second disc 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.490
 fifteen 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.789
 third disc 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.959
 the third disc happened an accident
