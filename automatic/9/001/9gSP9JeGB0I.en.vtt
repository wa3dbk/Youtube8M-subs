think<00:05:19.639> that's<00:05:19.970> really<00:05:20.150> cool<00:05:20.419> because<00:05:20.600> you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
think that's really cool because you

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.050 
think that's really cool because you
don't<00:05:21.050> have<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.440> go<00:05:22.310> into<00:05:22.490> college<00:05:22.760> and

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
don't have to go into college and

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.000 
don't have to go into college and
necessarily<00:05:23.690> change<00:05:23.960> your<00:05:24.139> major<00:05:24.290> five<00:05:24.710> times

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
necessarily change your major five times

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.409 
necessarily change your major five times
because<00:05:25.430> they're<00:05:25.550> not<00:05:25.700> quite<00:05:25.940> sure<00:05:25.970> what<00:05:26.300> you

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
because they're not quite sure what you

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.070 
because they're not quite sure what you
want<00:05:26.570> to<00:05:26.690> do

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080
