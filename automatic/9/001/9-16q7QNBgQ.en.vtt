00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.370
 that makes our movements of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 minecraft are more real example 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 our highs 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.809

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.130
 runs runs if we want to swim because we 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.159
 say yes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 if by chance you do not have a skin 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.330
 we put this Chinese face that is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.020
 what I would do is that your steve 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.909
 the default character of minecraft 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 if I had a face, it would be sad 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.660
 angry happy smiling cockroach 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.860
 and well let's move on to how it is installed 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.860
 if you have interested 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 Well let's move on to how it is installed 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.700
 I will put the links to the description 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.140
 for version 1.6 4 and 1.7 point 2 and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.150
 install differently because 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.840
 you have different things so we're going to 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.510
 pass now 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.110
 and I show you and good guys here 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.330
 We have several files worth this 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.300
 RAR folder is where the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.240
 cheer up player for version 1.6 point 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.220
 4 and these two hard files are worth 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 for 1.7 point 2 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.630
 to install it we will have to go to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.720
 our windows button is worth here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.680
 write percent to pepe data 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 percent 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.740
 we are going to roam 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.200
 it does not matter if you write it in capital letters or 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.790
 lowercase I tell you that windows do not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.880
 distinguishes if it is a larger column 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.700
 tiny so you do not care here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 we come to point minecraft and here to the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.440
 folder remember that you have to have the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.410
 forge of version 1.6 point 4 for 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.160
 for the version you want only 1.7 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.800
 points 2 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.710
 we come to mods and here as you can see I have the 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.080
 encourage laws for 1.6 point 4 which is the 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.030
 what you have seen is worth and simply 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 you need to put the folder rar 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.310
 download it put it here and you're 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.330
 what do you want to use that you have the version 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.490
 1.7 points or you want to eliminate it is this 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.440
 because otherwise it would not work 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.960
 to eliminate it as I have it here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.180
 saved nothing happens and you take these two 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.240
 files and put them in the folders in 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.910
 the folder is valid and it would work for you 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.260
 for version 1.7 point to remember 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.400
 that you have to have the forge in the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 version 1.7 point doctor next 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.230
 we close and we are going to open our 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.230
 Minecraft 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.530
 in passing I tell you how to change the version 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.019
 of the forge in case you have the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.019
 several installed versions and you do not know 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.019
 how do I tell you now how to do it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.510
 well once the minecraft opens 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:04.030
 we have the forge we need to put the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.739
 profile forge and will put the forge of the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.459
 Last version that you have installed 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.230
 I install a good installed 1.7 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.709
 points 2 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.269
 but to use version 1.6 point 4 I have 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.310
 had to change what is worth as you see 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.030
 here I have version 1.6 point 4 for 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.550
 change it again at 1.7 point 2 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.889
 we just come to edit profile 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.450
 we see to be a valid version and here we have 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.090
 the versions that we have of minecraft 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.680
 As you can see, I have few because 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.410
 installed in the latest versions other 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.260
 but of them and I just have the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.970
 version 1.6 point 4 the forge is worth and the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.740
 1.7 point 2 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.389
 to 1024 that is the last one that I have been 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.229
 which is the best new I also have 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.120
 in this patch for textures good 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.099
 programs with plugs recently worth 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.650
 just to change this pressure 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.240
 we press and keep it 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.639
 and as you can see we have changed the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.310
 1.7 point version so you could already 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.280
 get me the cheer player is worth in the mod 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.250
 with this version we have the 1.6 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.190
 point 4 for the same we come here 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.780
 we change we save and that's it and we go 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.960
 to our minecraft and we can use 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.310
 the animate player for version 2.3.4 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.660
 and good guys I hope that I have 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.919
 liked to remember to give the line 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.850
