00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.940
 big hello to all today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 work on an album about tourist 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 trips that were 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.590
 Vasya two cities Singapore and Hong Kong here 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
 so I laid out for myself on what 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 pages which photos will be 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 approximately on topics to decide 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.460
 how many pages do I need 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.350
 and also prepared these 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.340
 all sorts of items that i will 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 use in album in album always 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.210
 maximum save all kinds 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 tickets outline map travel bags 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 plane tickets and so on here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.980
 so I prepared everything here since 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 there are so many of these wide 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 Avenues and they are big then I decided 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 make an album 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.010
 and 4 formats, respectively 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 prepared here such carvings which 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 I will use just such an album to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 and a set of felling 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 Here are all kinds of stickers 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 envelopes which are also me 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.170
 associated with all and chemism as if 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.170
 put dates like these with stickers 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.780
 This page I had 2 photos 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.579
 there will be no little clamshells 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.280
 I will talk about the materials that I 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:50.560
 used 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 so to make i like to beat here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.819
 these bubbles on paper 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.210
 so I did what I cut down on paper 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:05.729
 Is it a normal white paper? 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.890
 use paper for watercolor and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:15.610
 used this kind of knife for cutting 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.019
 further craft paper which I will still 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.840
 a lot of use in this album 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:25.060
 I take here from such an album for with here 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.430
 guard paper with a density of 70 grams 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.370
 Originally on this page, I'm all 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.480
 just laid out neatly stepping back 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.329
 everywhere there are two or three millimeters all so 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:44.519
 sedately noble and then I decided 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:44.519
 a little prank and make all the move 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 disciplined a little bit 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.880
 to dream 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.799
 so you see that I have a substrate 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 so is covered here and still today 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:04.420
 i will add spray i really want 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.639
 so that the spray was especially visible here on 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.040
 Kraft his paper seems to me a spray 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.530
 white on the craft will look 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.530
 very interesting Well traveled 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:02.750
 further we wait a little dried up 1000 dash 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:09.770
 catch this string for this 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.770
 awl case in two hole locations 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.760
 and I will mount with the help of such 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.760
 brothers 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.640
 as 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.630
 but 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:59.250
 eat our page is ready i would more 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:02.210
 I did not add anything here 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:07.400
 as far as you think 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:10.710
 naughty here but I like her very much 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.140
 here is such a boat here just 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.150

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:21.210
 quite symbolic and here some 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.250

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.440

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.710
 bulk salsa element 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.890
 I want to show you also the first page 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.930
 in the album that I designed means 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:46.820
 there is one cot here so brother 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:50.070
 opens and inside we see 3 pics 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.980
 so these pictures were green 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.850
 on peak victoria this is one of the most 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.150
 Hong Kong's brightest points 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:03.780

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.100
 You decided to make this clamshell from 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:26.220
 how much respectively 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.730
