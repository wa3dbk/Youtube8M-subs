00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:18.400
 Yes This time is also on learning answer, but it's also a little if you try a little brush pen as well 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:21.699
 I would like to introduce that there is a merit of writing like a pen 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.199
 Well Toka pen and or to use when writing a two-housing complex 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:32.470
 I think there are many mechanical pencils, etc. 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 I use a brush pen and use it everyday I think that there are quite a few people who use it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.809
 I will 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.970
 10 boxes and pen case pen case 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.360
 For example, I think that there are few people who always have a pen 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.410
 It is by all means on a beautiful appeal 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.700
 To be asked to practice even more of that Furepe 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.930
 Although it is repeated, it is why it is recommended though 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:04.190
 Well Well pen 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:07.110
 The biggest feature of digio night side is in the character written in the so-called the point 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.470
 Kanji hiragana katakana is yeah 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.690
 For example, now you are writing with a pen 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.690
 Though it is Heisei year after year 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:31.710
 For example , there may be many people written like this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 Yes in and have become their own in the so-called prefecture I This Is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.690
 So this is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.000
 Huh 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.060
 Because selling altogether I want to try a little changed but still originally that feeling 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.160
 a but also Hiragana and Katakana 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:54.680
 Because the character is a premise to say applications written using a writing brush brush characteristics of the with everyday movement de la subcontract 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.950
 The 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.829
 The 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.180
 If you are not conscious enough, you will not be able to write well in a balanced manner. 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.160
 That the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.160
 It is Heisei , I want to write a little 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 Goodbye To depress the firm jerk 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.080
 Poe 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 Step into 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.790
 Come and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.370
 The last is 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.940
 It's like this when you get it done 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.940
 correction 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.330
 Pom 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.650
 One gun 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 together 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.220
 I feel like this is the difference between these two, but of course it's a touch shop 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.150
 Because 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 until photos 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.750
 The difference is by all means, is it the biggest point? 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.750
 Such places 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:01.460
 The so-called Tomehaneharai everyone's also high that 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.090
 Of course I think I would have come, but I was conscious of Tomehaneharai firmly 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.270
 Let's go 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.240
 Especially pay and wings 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.730
 I 've written this before, so I'm firmly aware of it 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.190
 Stop 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.740
 waiting 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.130
 It is such a form 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.880
 Of course , even if you stop 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:28.330
 Show more beautiful as plus alpha 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.080
 At the same time, it will be necessary to restore the original Tomehane Harai form. 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.790
 I will 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.969
 Using the same pen with the fact that 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.260
 It is born this movement One more time Heisei 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.260
 I want to write 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.910
 It is said that the thickness does not come out but it is said that it rushed and stepped down firmly 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.580
 Take 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.250
 Step in firmly 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.819
 Long out 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.190
 Firm last go belly 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:03.830
 Suddenly Although the change of the unit is I do not almost stick because pens 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:06.990
 Depending stop is the place to stop'll pay Where should pay inadvertently originally 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.740
 The place where it bounces is feather Rio well 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.460
 One by one such movement 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.000
 If I clear it 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:22.420
 Doing so makes it easier to take the letter shape Yes 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.460
 How is it about winning? 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:35.740
 It's a trash using a pen, I think it's like I'm conscious of the movements of Hanai and feathers like this 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:40.360
 It won't be possible to win, but as you have already seen that, you know 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.440
 As brush pen is made thinner and smoked where it becomes thinner because the leave is the thickness 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.340
 The place where it was splashed is also a supplement 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:51.810
 It becomes easy to put that feeling of becoming 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.249
 After all there is only a brush pen and it is very close to the movement of the brush 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.959
 The brush's original movement 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:02.330
 Of course that it is that easy to remember easy to grasp 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:08.659
 Speaking of the real truth 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:11.300
 If you start from a place called with the actual ne corner care is writing brush write to the revised paper 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.950
 It is good, but quite well 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.090
 a soon then 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:21.050
 It's a little difficult to say how long you can start writing 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.480
 Some things need to have various explanations 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.639
 After using 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.659
 Koh Chang recommendations 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:32.020
 Because there are places that want to be rough and dry 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:36.139
 If it is a brush pen, you can use the cap immediately if removed 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.960
 Especially after wearing that 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.280
 Do not clean up after the cap 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.770
 This Byosho 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:50.800
 You can use it immediately if you 're out 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:56.080
 If you dye it, it's already over 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:00.460
 If you want to be beautiful, please take a moment. 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:10.030
 You may feel your detour 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:13.210
 It is strongly recommended that you have your pens aligned with you. 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.569
 It is by all means is anyone who Na want to do my best towards the character 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.960
 When Frepe works together 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:24.219
 It is more fun and I EYoshi character beautiful character 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:31.389
 I hope I can tell you that I can aim 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:32.360
 So, this time , I would like to introduce the merits of writing brush pen. 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:37.090
 Was 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.090
 Thank you for watching until the end
