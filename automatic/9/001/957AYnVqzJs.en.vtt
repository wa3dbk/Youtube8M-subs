00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.790 
did it happen
and<00:04:27.390> what<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.930> chances<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.590> going<00:04:28.740> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
and what is the chances it's going to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.730 
and what is the chances it's going to
happen<00:04:28.950> again<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.050> important<00:04:31.650> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
happen again and this is important to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.430 
happen again and this is important to
their<00:04:31.920> family<00:04:32.310> planning<00:04:32.580> issues<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.410> try

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
their family planning issues and we try

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.470 
their family planning issues and we try
our<00:04:34.890> best<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.580> provide<00:04:35.820> them<00:04:36.270> with<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
our best to provide them with the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.540 
our best to provide them with the
answers<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.320> each<00:04:37.350> one<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.800> those<00:04:37.980> questions

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
answers to each one of those questions

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.240 
answers to each one of those questions
one<00:04:39.240> thing<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.660> we've<00:04:39.810> learned

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
one thing that we've learned

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.390 
one thing that we've learned
tremendously<00:04:41.250> from<00:04:42.290> DNA<00:04:43.290> sequencing<00:04:43.920> is<00:04:44.160> that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
tremendously from DNA sequencing is that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.350 
tremendously from DNA sequencing is that
many<00:04:44.760> mutations<00:04:45.360> can<00:04:46.080> occur<00:04:46.140> as<00:04:46.920> new<00:04:47.850> events

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
many mutations can occur as new events

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.230 
many mutations can occur as new events
so<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.290> never<00:04:49.710> been<00:04:49.950> passed<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.670> family

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
so it's never been passed in the family

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.330 
so it's never been passed in the family
it's<00:04:51.450> happened<00:04:51.840> for<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.050> first<00:04:52.110> time<00:04:52.650> in<00:04:53.070> this

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
it's happened for the first time in this

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.090 
it's happened for the first time in this
individual<00:04:54.000> patient<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:55.140> if<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.530> get<00:04:55.740> back<00:04:55.890> to

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
individual patient so if I get back to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.310 
individual patient so if I get back to
the<00:04:56.220> questions<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.000> all<00:04:57.420> parents<00:04:57.690> want<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
the questions that all parents want to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.970 
the questions that all parents want to
know<00:04:58.530> what<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.990> why<00:05:00.990> did<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.290> happen<00:05:01.530> and

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
know what is this why did it happen and

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.270 
know what is this why did it happen and
what<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.700> chance<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.240> happening<00:05:03.270> again

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
what is the chance of it happening again

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.000 
what is the chance of it happening again
often<00:05:05.280> one<00:05:06.150> DNA<00:05:06.510> sequencing<00:05:07.080> tests<00:05:07.560> could

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
often one DNA sequencing tests could

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.490 
often one DNA sequencing tests could
answer<00:05:08.550> all<00:05:09.120> those<00:05:09.540> questions<00:05:09.600> for<00:05:10.320> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
answer all those questions for the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.950 
answer all those questions for the
family
