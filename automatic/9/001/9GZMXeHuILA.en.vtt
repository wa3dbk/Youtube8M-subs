and everything so obviously I need a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
and everything so obviously I need a

reason that they claim you can't use a
tripod<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.709> modified<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.119> too

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
tripod of modified is because it's too

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.819 
tripod of modified is because it's too
big<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.630> bulky<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> interferes<00:01:55.469> with<00:01:55.679> other

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
big and bulky and interferes with other

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.469 
big and bulky and interferes with other
people<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:56.939> something<00:01:57.360> here

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
people and so we have something here

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.669 
people and so we have something here
that<00:01:57.509> doesn't<00:01:57.840> interfere<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.439> any<00:01:58.590> way

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
that doesn't interfere in any way

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.059 
that doesn't interfere in any way
whatsoever<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:00.000> yet<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.929> came<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> put<00:02:01.979> up

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
whatsoever and yet they came and put up

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.249 
whatsoever and yet they came and put up
a<00:02:02.159> fuss<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.810> works<00:02:04.079> at
