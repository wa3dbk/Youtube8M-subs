like<00:01:14.729> pop<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.299> maybe<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.689> why<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.960> teeth

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
self-conscious about it and I would get

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
self-conscious about it and I would get

it comes with instructions inside and
everything<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.430> after<00:02:46.849> you<00:02:47.120> send<00:02:47.329> out

your mold about a week later you're

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.559 
your mold about a week later you're
going<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.400> get<00:02:49.519> this<00:02:49.700> little<00:02:49.879> container<00:02:50.269> that

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
going to get this little container that

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.410 
going to get this little container that
has<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:51.139> little<00:02:51.739> clearer<00:02:52.519> trays<00:02:52.909> in<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.209> and

has your little clearer trays in it and
they<00:02:53.659> pretty<00:02:53.900> much<00:02:53.989> look<00:02:54.319> like<00:02:54.349> retainers<00:02:54.950> or

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
they pretty much look like retainers or

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.920 
they pretty much look like retainers or
Invisalign<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.060> reason<00:02:56.359> why<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.569> can't

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
Invisalign the reason why this can't

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.629 
Invisalign the reason why this can't
work<00:02:57.139> so<00:02:57.379> well<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.650> because<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:58.159> those<00:02:58.280> trays

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
work so well is because of those trays

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.580 
work so well is because of those trays
and<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:58.970> allows<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.510> whitening<00:03:00.019> gel<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.409> sit

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
and that allows the whitening gel to sit

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.080 
and that allows the whitening gel to sit
directly<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:01.040> your<00:03:01.280> teeth<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.849> like<00:03:02.030> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
directly on your teeth and have like a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.179 
directly on your teeth and have like a
plastic<00:03:02.389> in<00:03:02.689> between<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.109> your<00:03:03.290> spit<00:03:03.620> mouth

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
plastic in between like your spit mouth

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.339 
plastic in between like your spit mouth
and<00:03:04.579> your<00:03:05.000> teeth<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.900> gel<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.109> just

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
and your teeth so the gel is just

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.679 
and your teeth so the gel is just
directly<00:03:06.829> on<00:03:07.069> there<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.909> plastic<00:03:08.120> keeps

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
directly on there and the plastic keeps

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.869 
directly on there and the plastic keeps
it<00:03:08.840> all<00:03:08.989> locked<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.829> really<00:03:10.159> allows<00:03:10.579> the

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
it all locked in and really allows the

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.910 
it all locked in and really allows the
peroxide<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.900> work<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.349> bleach<00:03:12.709> your<00:03:12.889> teeth

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920

so let's get right into how to make the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.830 
so let's get right into how to make the
molds<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.280> ship<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.060> out<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.449> get<00:03:38.659> your

three catalyst paste and three bases and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.180 
three catalyst paste and three bases and
that<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.229> enough<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.680> top<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.069> bottom

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
mold and then extra if you make a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.509 
mold and then extra if you make a
mistake<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.650> I'm<00:03:48.829> just<00:03:48.979> going<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.159> be<00:03:49.250> taking

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
mistake so I'm just going to be taking

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.399 
mistake so I'm just going to be taking
the<00:03:49.609> base<00:03:49.819> piece<00:03:50.120> which<00:03:50.659> is<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:51.019> white<00:03:51.229> and

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
the base piece which is the white and

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.170 
the base piece which is the white and
the<00:03:51.470> catalyst<00:03:51.949> which<00:03:52.159> is<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.430> blue<00:03:52.669> and<00:03:52.940> then

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
the catalyst which is the blue and then

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.099 
the catalyst which is the blue and then
you're<00:03:53.329> just<00:03:53.359> going<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.690> mix<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.930> together

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
you're just going to mix that together

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.319 
you're just going to mix that together
for<00:03:54.470> around<00:03:54.650> 60<00:03:55.250> seconds<00:03:55.669> don't<00:03:55.970> take<00:03:56.150> too

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
for around 60 seconds don't take too

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.689 
for around 60 seconds don't take too
long<00:03:56.479> because<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.989> begins<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.500> harden<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.250> you

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
long because it begins to harden and you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.069 
long because it begins to harden and you
don't<00:03:58.879> want<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.540> it's<00:03:59.720> just<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.989> to

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
don't want that so it's just going to

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.710 
don't want that so it's just going to
become<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.500> lighter<00:04:00.919> blue<00:04:01.190> color<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.790> then

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
become a lighter blue color and then

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.729 
become a lighter blue color and then
you're<00:04:02.870> just<00:04:02.900> going<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.199> roll<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:03.470> into<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
you're just going to roll it into the

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.500 
you're just going to roll it into the
cylinder<00:04:04.190> shape<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.639> put<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.879> in<00:04:04.970> your<00:04:05.090> tray

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
cylinder shape and put it in your tray

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.289 
cylinder shape and put it in your tray
with<00:04:06.290> an<00:04:06.470> even<00:04:06.739> amount<00:04:06.829> on<00:04:07.129> each<00:04:07.159> side<00:04:07.549> after

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
with an even amount on each side after

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.270 
with an even amount on each side after
that's<00:04:08.479> done<00:04:08.750> you're<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.139> to<00:04:09.440> pop<00:04:09.979> it<00:04:10.159> in

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
that's done you're going to pop it in

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.099 
that's done you're going to pop it in
your<00:04:10.310> mouth<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.639> make<00:04:11.239> sure<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.870> have

all your teeth pushed completely in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.330 
all your teeth pushed completely in

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.869 

and<00:04:49.770> then<00:04:50.129> you're<00:04:50.220> going<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.370> take<00:04:50.580> both<00:04:50.819> your

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.240 

and<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:02.169> when<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.380> put<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.830> make<00:05:03.009> sure<00:05:03.160> to

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
put it in an afford pressing motion so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.960 
put it in an afford pressing motion so
it<00:05:05.229> gets<00:05:05.350> evenly<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:06.039> your<00:05:06.220> teeth<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.639> doesn't

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
spill out at the top and then do the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.850 
spill out at the top and then do the
same<00:05:10.479> for<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.690> bottom<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:11.080> well<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.650> you're
