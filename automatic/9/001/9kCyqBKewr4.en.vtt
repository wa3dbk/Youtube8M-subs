I<00:04:15.910> said<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.090> know<00:04:17.150> something<00:04:18.010> listen<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.520> can

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
I said you know something listen you can

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.970 
I said you know something listen you can
go<00:04:19.790> back<00:04:20.000> further<00:04:20.300> than<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.660> what<00:04:21.620> about<00:04:21.830> the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
go back further than that what about the

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.629 
go back further than that what about the
carbon<00:04:22.490> atoms<00:04:23.140> fair

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639

human<00:04:26.479> life<00:04:26.689> could<00:04:27.050> not<00:04:27.199> exist<00:04:27.409> without

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
carbon so is it just possible that maybe

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.529 
carbon so is it just possible that maybe
we<00:04:30.979> shouldn't<00:04:31.340> be<00:04:31.460> burning<00:04:31.699> all<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.270> coal
