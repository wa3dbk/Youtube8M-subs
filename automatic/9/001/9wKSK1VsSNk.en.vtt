00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
is based on deception I really hope that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
is based on deception I really hope that
this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> recording<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.579> cannot<00:01:53.969> tell

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this is recording because I cannot tell

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.870 
this is recording because I cannot tell

but right now as you can see multiplayer

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.419 
but right now as you can see multiplayer
zero<00:02:00.659> percent<00:02:01.020> complete<00:02:01.319> because<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.979> does

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
zero percent complete because it does

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.230 
zero percent complete because it does
not<00:02:02.460> work<00:02:03.079> campaign<00:02:04.079> works<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.210> does

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
going to I'm going to turn the volume on

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.500 
going to I'm going to turn the volume on
the<00:04:03.349> game<00:04:03.530> off<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.040> does<00:04:04.879> not<00:04:05.030> interfere

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
the game off so that does not interfere

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.589 
the game off so that does not interfere
with<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.510> does<00:04:08.689> not<00:04:08.900> interfere<00:04:09.260> with<00:04:09.709> the

but yeah does work if I said watch all
the<00:05:00.850> chance<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.210> calibration<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:01.960> my<00:05:02.050> mouth<00:05:03.390> so

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.939 
one of the u.s. brother nate'll
receiving<00:06:50.650> masses<00:06:51.159> and<00:06:52.289> when<00:06:53.289> I<00:06:53.319> play<00:06:53.680> call

duty<00:06:54.130> for<00:06:54.550> my<00:06:55.509> I<00:06:55.539> have<00:06:55.780> to<00:06:55.900> turn<00:06:56.080> the

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
duty for my I have to turn the

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.320 
duty for my I have to turn the
sensitivity<00:06:57.069> all<00:06:57.190> the<00:06:57.310> way<00:06:57.370> down<00:06:57.610> because<00:06:58.090> I'd

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
sensitivity all the way down because I'd

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.230 
sensitivity all the way down because I'd
be<00:06:58.449> turning<00:06:58.840> like<00:06:59.470> when<00:06:59.710> I<00:06:59.740> turn<00:07:00.039> to<00:07:00.430> shoot<00:07:00.669> it

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
be turning like when I turn to shoot it

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.930 
be turning like when I turn to shoot it
goes<00:07:01.509> too<00:07:01.750> fast<00:07:02.099> but<00:07:03.099> when<00:07:03.219> I<00:07:03.250> have<00:07:03.430> on<00:07:03.669> this

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
goes too fast but when I have on this

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.089 
goes too fast but when I have on this
and<00:07:04.270> I<00:07:04.360> have<00:07:04.509> the<00:07:04.630> calibration<00:07:05.139> the<00:07:05.229> same<00:07:05.440> it

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
and I have the calibration the same it

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:19.499 
and I have the calibration the same it
goes<00:07:06.340> too<00:07:06.639> slow<00:07:06.669> as<00:07:07.210> you<00:07:07.270> can<00:07:07.360> see<00:07:15.810> yeah<00:07:18.509> that's

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:19.509 
goes too slow as you can see yeah that's

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.550 
goes too slow as you can see yeah that's
