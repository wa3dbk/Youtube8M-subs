00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.000 
know insane look and I'm dress at your
opening<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:43.110> millions<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.620> kinds<00:02:43.920> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
opening like millions of kinds of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
opening like millions of kinds of
practice<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.310> I'm<00:02:44.400> should<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.730> anything

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
around eventually and we will be able to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.340 
around eventually and we will be able to
rub<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.360> people's<00:02:51.690> faces<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.170> well

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
rub it in people's faces as well

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.860 
rub it in people's faces as well
eventually<00:02:52.710> so<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:54.780> these

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
eventually so and but not with these

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
eventually so and but not with these
packs<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.350> far<00:02:55.560> because<00:02:55.710> these<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.250> fucking

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
packs so far because these are fucking

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000 
packs so far because these are fucking
shocking<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:58.800> know<00:02:58.830> what<00:02:58.980> to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
shocking but I really don't know what to

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.930 
shocking but I really don't know what to
talk<00:02:59.160> about<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.400> guess<00:02:59.550> we<00:02:59.670> should<00:02:59.790> probably

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
talk about I guess we should probably

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.280 
talk about I guess we should probably
talk<00:03:00.120> about<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.390> Champions<00:03:00.780> League<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.170> know

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.250 
talk about the Champions League you know
them<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.420> who's<00:03:03.420> played<00:03:03.660> are<00:03:03.930> still<00:03:04.140> have

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
them I think who's played are still have

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
them I think who's played are still have
played<00:03:04.470> against<00:03:04.830> Bayern<00:03:05.610> Munich<00:03:05.910> very

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
played against Bayern Munich very

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.030 
played against Bayern Munich very
important<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.320> score<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.710> game<00:03:07.920> in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
important not to score in that game in

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.320 
important not to score in that game in
my<00:03:08.130> opinion<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:09.060> played<00:03:09.300> very

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.820 
my opinion you know they played very
very<00:03:09.630> well<00:03:09.810> even<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.440> were<00:03:10.500> 10<00:03:10.680> but

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
very well even when there were 10 but

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.760

Boateng which I'm not sure is upgraded I
can't<00:05:56.580> think<00:05:56.879> why<00:05:57.089> I<00:05:57.389> think<00:05:57.870> he's<00:05:58.289> upgraded

but<00:05:59.009> i'm<00:05:59.610> thinking<00:06:00.089> that<00:06:00.120> basically<00:06:00.599> because

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
but i'm thinking that basically because

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.390 
but i'm thinking that basically because
he's<00:06:01.229> not<00:06:01.409> a<00:06:01.469> duplicate<00:06:01.919> when<00:06:02.009> I<00:06:02.039> got<00:06:02.219> him<00:06:02.310> in

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
he's not a duplicate when I got him in

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.029 
he's not a duplicate when I got him in
the<00:06:02.460> pack<00:06:02.639> and<00:06:02.909> when<00:06:03.719> I<00:06:03.750> am<00:06:04.259> pretty<00:06:04.650> sure<00:06:04.800> I've

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
the pack and when I am pretty sure I've

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.399 
the pack and when I am pretty sure I've
already<00:06:05.189> got<00:06:05.460> an<00:06:05.610> 82<00:06:06.120> raid<00:06:06.419> or<00:06:06.599> anyone<00:06:06.990> boating

already got an 82 raid or anyone boating

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.589 
already got an 82 raid or anyone boating
if<00:06:07.650> that's<00:06:08.219> why<00:06:08.430> is<00:06:08.490> not<00:06:08.759> all<00:06:08.879> right<00:06:09.029> it<00:06:09.120> is<00:06:09.270> but

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
if that's why is not all right it is but

was his name we got like three of them
but<00:06:54.090> they<00:06:54.210> were<00:06:54.270> only<00:06:54.389> worth<00:06:54.689> like<00:06:54.719> 40<00:06:55.469> cage<00:06:55.680> so

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
but they were only worth like 40 cage so

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.339 
but they were only worth like 40 cage so
really<00:06:56.789> bad<00:06:56.969> in<00:06:57.120> forms<00:06:57.479> are<00:06:57.629> really<00:06:57.900> bad<00:06:58.050> blue

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.890 
two more 7.5 impacts number leave it
there<00:07:05.039> because<00:07:05.159> it's<00:07:05.819> just<00:07:06.060> wasting<00:07:06.840> our

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.300

million coins though so it really

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.629 
million coins though so it really
