00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello and welcome to the iphone site 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.750
 boutiques.com we make a small 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 video to present the tester of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 shop so this tester is made for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.990
 test iphone screens 4 and 4s so 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.100
 I give you a demonstration 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:26.550
 So here I am I tablecloth lcd tablecloth 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.800
 touch so the green led which means 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.590
 that the taxi function very well a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.530
 little animation 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 that's all the colors that goes on 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 here are the skulls present as default 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 so the test is conclusive 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 that's it if you see little bubbles at 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.149
 the screen is normal there is no 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.149
 wrong it's just the protective film 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.210
 here is the show on a blank screen 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 little advice 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.630
 when you put new screen in the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.130
 chassis you lifted your old 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 screen on the iphone 4 4s time you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.860
 put the tablecloths in the frame of a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.009
 touch man behind and a little ne 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.689
 the one you see is very fragile so 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.880
 a role to enter one must pass well 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 the little one does not see it often happens here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.909
 that does not cling and that the tablecloth 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 fold and after you believe do I think 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.479
 we have quite a few customers who 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.140
 call by saying that the tablecloth is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.700
 too short 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.880
 or was not it after if you shoot 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.820
 too loud too she breaks 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.290
 so here is a little advice made there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.020
 well entered the chassis there I come 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.570
 to manipulate it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.040
 there is not too much here so the dr 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 which means the touch works very 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 well 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.760
 the little animation and colors 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.700
 so everything is better here's what I'm doing 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.260
 said compared to the tablecloths especially the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:27.040
 China tax be very careful 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.060
 important and very fragile 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.500
 if you break it and there will be more 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.370
 technique show you just now 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.090
 compared to thaksin so the colors 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.170
 the color screens are packed 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.090
 people who tell us that it was 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.760
 opened by mail no it's us who 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.980
 will play to test them so the same lcd 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.200
 tactile 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.200
 this part touch function driven 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.590
 this animation 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:13.950
 so that's all okay here I'm going 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:23.700
 show you what it does on the screen 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:29.280
 defective a tactile here is we 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.010
 supports a red led which means that 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.840
 the touch does not work here is boyer 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.200
 the animation it is ceded by cons 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.830
 works but fears stop going 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.830
 go to the trash 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.660
 so this little video is for 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.790
 show you that all our screens are 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.010
 tested with a tester before we made 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.660
 that with motherboards iphone 4 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.450
 was too much dyed that 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.920
 light up a contest so here's all 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.340
 our screens are tested before 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.720
 to send 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.209

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.079
