00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone again welcome to me 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.930
 channel I am jaycee and here I bring you a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 New gameplay of hawking combat death 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.860
 by teams uk- perfect let's go 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.860
 for inside not to see how it goes 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.539
 or this map I like quite a lot to see if 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.310
 we are lucky and we do not catch a game 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.009
 that it has already started if it is started 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.919
 do not have two minutes left because 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.840
 You can be lucky or have a shit 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.270
 of luck and find you that they put you in 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.660
 a team in which all the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 world more than burst the team 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.520
 enemy more than confident and as much as 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.559
 make good in fact that already I think what 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.940
 we saw in the previous gameplay that 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.710
 delivery in a game that was 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.000
 you start, I was the only one who gave you the positive 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.239
 of my team but because I think that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.980
 played more 3 567 minutes at best 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.980
 of a game of 15 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.430
 if your load 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.230
 and ready 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.070
 First 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.840
 good has entered a starting game 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's see how is the thing has made me 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.650
 touched the team that will ask seeing 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.650
 with one eye 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.500
 what that has been 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.409
 then you turn off that kind of thing 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.679
 I do not like to hear Russian screaming while 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.679
 game 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.130
 Y 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.640
 I found 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.450
 I have found 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.450
 not many 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 and he wants it from trujillo 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.910

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.030

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
 I here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 Right 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.510
 that has left me touched not enough 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.740
 but the challenge of walking 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.420
 my mother my mother who battle 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.609
 maternal but this is a problem 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 because when you start a game 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.040
 as I said before you can meet with 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.980
 people that are already not generated because here 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.980
