one<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.710> benefits<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.280> bringing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
one of the benefits of bringing

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.210 
one of the benefits of bringing
hospital-grade<00:02:32.270> anesthesia<00:02:33.200> machines<00:02:33.650> into

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
hospital-grade anesthesia machines into

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.490 
hospital-grade anesthesia machines into
the<00:02:34.310> office<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.570> it'll<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.140> allows<00:02:36.470> us

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the office is is that it'll it allows us

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.160 
the office is is that it'll it allows us
to<00:02:36.920> do<00:02:37.070> what<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.820> called<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.210> mask<00:02:38.450> induction

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
to do what is called a mask induction

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.320 
to do what is called a mask induction
and<00:02:39.710> basically<00:02:40.070> what<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.090> allows

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
and basically what that is is it allows

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.600 
and basically what that is is it allows
the<00:02:41.600> child<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.050> bring<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.920> breathe<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> gas

the child to bring and to breathe a gas

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.680 
the child to bring and to breathe a gas
and<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> process<00:02:45.050> fall<00:02:45.320> asleep<00:02:46.690> after

and in the process fall asleep after

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.300 
and in the process fall asleep after
which<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.080> know<00:02:48.230> we<00:02:48.350> can<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.710> some<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
which you know we can do some of the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.240 
which you know we can do some of the
more<00:02:49.520> traumatic<00:02:50.360> things<00:02:50.600> like<00:02:51.100> starting<00:02:52.100> an

breathing device three advantages that
most<00:02:59.330> dentists<00:02:59.750> mentioned<00:03:00.230> when<00:03:00.800> they<00:03:00.950> do
