00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
some lag from time to time it's hard to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.190 
some lag from time to time it's hard to
replicate<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.299> camera<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.080> some

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
replicate on camera but it's just some

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.590 
replicate on camera but it's just some
basic<00:02:52.560> things<00:02:52.590> browsing<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.549> web<00:02:53.610> doing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
basic things browsing the web doing

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.690 
basic things browsing the web doing
things<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.110> nature<00:02:55.350> for<00:02:56.190> example<00:02:56.220> let<00:02:56.640> me

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
things of that nature for example let me

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.509 
things of that nature for example let me
go<00:02:56.819> into<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> phone<00:02:57.209> or<00:02:57.390> contacts<00:02:57.900> music<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
go into the phone or contacts music you

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.650 
go into the phone or contacts music you
can<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.880> kind<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.030> stutters<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
can see it kind of stutters is the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.390 
can see it kind of stutters is the
animation<00:03:01.019> loads<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.650> now<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.160> something

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
animation loads up now that's something

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
animation loads up now that's something
that<00:03:02.430> happens<00:03:02.819> system-wide<00:03:03.299> on<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.230> pretty

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
that happens system-wide on a pretty

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.170 
that happens system-wide on a pretty
regular<00:03:04.500> basis<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.730> you're<00:03:05.910> somebody<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
regular basis so if you're somebody that

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.030 
regular basis so if you're somebody that
is<00:03:06.480> bothered<00:03:06.840> by<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.989> myself<00:03:07.349> included

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
is bothered by that myself included

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.440 
is bothered by that myself included
that's<00:03:08.190> definitely<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.610> con<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:08.910> don't<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
that's definitely a con I don't like to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.000 
that's definitely a con I don't like to
see<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> device<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> 1.9

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010

this<00:03:13.830> device<00:03:14.069> should<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.370> moving<00:03:14.580> faster

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
this device should be moving faster

hopefully in the future software update
they'll<00:03:16.890> continue<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.310> optimize<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
they'll continue to optimize that so

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.000 
they'll continue to optimize that so
TouchWiz<00:03:19.140> works<00:03:19.350> well<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:19.950> are
