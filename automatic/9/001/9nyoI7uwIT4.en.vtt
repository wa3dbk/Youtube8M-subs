pretty amusing because he says he's only
seen<00:00:21.600> maybe<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.500> other<00:00:22.619> person<00:00:22.949> besides<00:00:23.550> me

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
seen maybe one other person besides me

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.769 
seen maybe one other person besides me
wear<00:00:24.600> their<00:00:24.720> hair<00:00:24.930> grew<00:00:25.140> faster<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> back

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
wear their hair grew faster in the back

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.650 
wear their hair grew faster in the back
so<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> pretty<00:00:28.920> funny<00:00:29.330> he<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.480> also

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
vegetarian and yeah i think that men

vegetarian and yeah i think that men
make<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.510> better<00:00:36.719> hairdressers<00:00:37.559> than

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
it seems like it's very much more easier

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
it seems like it's very much more easier
for<00:00:53.460> them<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
for them to do here than it is for a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.340 
for them to do here than it is for a
woman<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> hair<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.140> maybe

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
woman to do a hair so I don't know maybe

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
woman to do a hair so I don't know maybe
it's<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.989> electoral<00:01:00.989> magnetic<00:01:01.649> am<00:01:02.160> FL<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's the electoral magnetic am FL or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.920 
it's the electoral magnetic am FL or
whatever<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.210> called<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> hair

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
whatever it's called from the hair

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
whatever it's called from the hair
dryers<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.920> probably<00:01:05.189> cause<00:01:05.549> women

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
dryers I think that probably cause women

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.850 
dryers I think that probably cause women
were<00:01:06.860> damaged<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.610> maybe<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:09.810> less<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
were damaged so maybe they're less you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
were damaged so maybe they're less you
know<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.189> why<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> less<00:01:11.850> fast

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
know that's why they're like less fast

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
know that's why they're like less fast
or<00:01:12.479> something<00:01:12.840> i'm<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.200> sure<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.790> think

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
or something i'm not sure but i think

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.320 
or something i'm not sure but i think
it's<00:01:15.150> called<00:01:15.210> EMF<00:01:15.900> l<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.799> kind<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's called EMF l it's some kind of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's called EMF l it's some kind of
radiation<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.960> something<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> hair<00:01:19.650> dryers

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
radiation or something that hair dryers

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
yelling at everyone and stuff and I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.760 
yelling at everyone and stuff and I
don't<00:01:55.740> understand<00:01:56.130> why<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.409> mean<00:01:58.409> he

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
don't understand why he was so mean he

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.749 
don't understand why he was so mean he
was<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.040> yelling<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.670> people<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> after

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
was like yelling at people and so after

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.679 
was like yelling at people and so after
that<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> came<00:02:03.299> home<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:05.030> had<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.180> stop<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that I came home and I had to stop it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.160 
that I came home and I had to stop it
like<00:02:06.920> four<00:02:07.920> different<00:02:08.750> restaurants<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
like four different restaurants just to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.860 
like four different restaurants just to
get<00:02:10.319> my<00:02:10.500> meal<00:02:10.830> together

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
get my meal together

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.399 
get my meal together
so<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.950> one<00:02:13.310> restaurant<00:02:13.909> might<00:02:14.299> have<00:02:14.629> let's

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the only thing I could get really was

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.610

around up I don't know I'm getting
really<00:03:06.769> tired<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.819> this<00:03:07.940> because<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.530> go<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.739> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
really tired of this because you go to a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.559 
really tired of this because you go to a
store<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.909> would<00:03:11.060> think<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.359> they

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
store and you would think that they

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.800 
store and you would think that they
would<00:03:11.599> always<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.730> organic<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.000> this<00:03:14.480> isn't

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
would always have organic and this isn't

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.379 
would always have organic and this isn't
the<00:03:14.900> case<00:03:15.109> at<00:03:15.170> whole<00:03:15.620> foods<00:03:15.950> here<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.549> then

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
the case at whole foods here and then

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.420 
the case at whole foods here and then
you<00:03:17.900> go<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.169> another<00:03:18.590> whole<00:03:18.859> foods<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.370> they

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
you go to another whole foods and they

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.420 
you go to another whole foods and they
they<00:03:19.760> might<00:03:20.000> have<00:03:20.590> something<00:03:21.590> else<00:03:21.769> organic

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
they might have something else organic

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.920 
they might have something else organic
so<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.510> run<00:03:23.720> all<00:03:23.750> over

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930
