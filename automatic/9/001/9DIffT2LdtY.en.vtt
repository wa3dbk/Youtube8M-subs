and then what I do is that's not going

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.690 
and then what I do is that's not going
to<00:02:21.120> hold<00:02:21.300> by<00:02:21.900> itself<00:02:22.260> okay<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.580> do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
to hold by itself okay so what you do

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
to hold by itself okay so what you do
I'm<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.060> using<00:02:24.210> Mod<00:02:24.480> Podge<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I'm just using Mod Podge and this is the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.730 
I'm just using Mod Podge and this is the
hard<00:02:26.490> coat<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.230> put<00:02:28.380> several<00:02:28.620> coats

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
hard coat so you can put several coats

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.800 
hard coat so you can put several coats
on<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.820> basically<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.780> around<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
on but you just basically go around and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you want to move on to like a magazine

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740 
you want to move on to like a magazine
page<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.670> say<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.910> don't<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> template

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
page and say you don't have a template

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080 
page and say you don't have a template
okay<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.100> basically<00:02:59.459> what<00:02:59.850> you're<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
okay so basically what you're going to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.520 
okay so basically what you're going to
do<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.690> make<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> kind<00:03:01.500> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
do is you just make like a kind of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.870 
do is you just make like a kind of
rectangle<00:03:02.540> here<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.459> then<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> just

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
rectangle here and so and then you just

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
rectangle here and so and then you just
take<00:03:06.150> your<00:03:06.209> make<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> come<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> point<00:03:07.440> okay

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
take your make it come to a point okay

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.580 
take your make it come to a point okay
and<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.820> really<00:03:09.209> random<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.380> does

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
and this can be really random it does

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.140 
and this can be really random it does
not<00:03:10.739> have<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.100> be<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.250> kind<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.700> guesstimate

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
not have to be just kind of guesstimate

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.570 
not have to be just kind of guesstimate
yeah<00:03:12.630> yeah<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.410> key<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.980> when<00:03:14.459> you're

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
yeah yeah and the key is when you're
