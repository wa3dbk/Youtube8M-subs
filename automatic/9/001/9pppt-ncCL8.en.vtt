effects<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.550> was<00:04:27.670> very<00:04:27.880> cool<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.150> see<00:04:28.510> that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
effects so it was very cool to see that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.390 
effects so it was very cool to see that
even<00:04:29.020> before<00:04:29.470> all<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.860> goes<00:04:30.010> into<00:04:30.040> play

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
even before all of that goes into play

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.450 
even before all of that goes into play
there's<00:04:30.760> an<00:04:30.940> artist<00:04:31.540> someplace<00:04:31.960> sitting

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
there's an artist someplace sitting

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.560 
there's an artist someplace sitting
constructing<00:04:33.460> little<00:04:33.700> tiny<00:04:33.940> managers<00:04:34.420> of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
constructing little tiny managers of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.240 
constructing little tiny managers of
things<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.230> CGI<00:04:35.560> artist<00:04:35.980> can<00:04:36.130> use

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
things that then the CGI artist can use

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.440 
things that then the CGI artist can use
when<00:04:36.430> they<00:04:36.520> even<00:04:36.700> work<00:04:36.820> on<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.060> film<00:04:37.270> they

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
when they even work on the film they

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.120 
when they even work on the film they
talk<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> bit<00:04:37.900> about<00:04:37.930> some<00:04:38.350> of<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> more<00:04:38.920> the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
talk a bit about some of the more the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.530 
talk a bit about some of the more the
technical<00:04:39.550> things<00:04:39.760> in<00:04:40.030> this<00:04:40.270> display

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
technical things in this display

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.390 
technical things in this display
obviously<00:04:41.050> there<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:42.250> cool

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
obviously there is a really cool

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.240 
obviously there is a really cool
blueprint<00:04:43.120> design<00:04:43.300> theme<00:04:44.110> going<00:04:44.740> on<00:04:44.980> you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
blueprint design theme going on you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.560 
blueprint design theme going on you
notice<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.640> little<00:04:45.700> subtle<00:04:46.090> thing<00:04:46.390> in<00:04:46.510> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
notice that little subtle thing in the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.300 
notice that little subtle thing in the
background<00:04:46.750> well<00:04:47.500> one<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.830> coolest

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
background well one of the coolest

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.670 
background well one of the coolest
miniatures<00:04:48.730> that<00:04:48.910> we<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.690> one<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.620> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
miniatures that we have and one that a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.020 
miniatures that we have and one that a
lot<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.950> people<00:04:51.190> have<00:04:51.280> seen<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.730> everybody

really<00:04:52.270> loves<00:04:52.480> is<00:04:52.720> actually<00:04:53.020> our<00:04:53.140> biggest

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
really loves is actually our biggest

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.560 
really loves is actually our biggest
miniature<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.730> masks<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.150> miniature<00:04:55.540> of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
miniature that masks the miniature of

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.240 
miniature that masks the miniature of
the<00:04:55.720> Nautilus<00:04:56.080> from<00:04:56.470> 20,000<00:04:56.980> Leagues<00:04:57.160> Under

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
the Nautilus from 20,000 Leagues Under

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.740 
the Nautilus from 20,000 Leagues Under
the<00:04:57.400> Sea

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
the Sea

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.730 
the Sea
unfortunately<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:58.840> too<00:04:59.080> big<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.440> fit<00:04:59.470> in<00:04:59.680> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
unfortunately it's too big to fit in the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.520 
unfortunately it's too big to fit in the
case<00:04:59.950> so<00:05:00.910> we<00:05:01.090> came<00:05:01.210> up<00:05:01.270> with<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.600> idea<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:02.290> our

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
case so we came up with this idea as our

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.560 
case so we came up with this idea as our
way<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.770> showing<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.610> in<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.090> models<00:05:04.450> of

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
way of showing it in the models of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.910 
way of showing it in the models of
miniatures<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.530> was<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.740> take<00:05:05.860> a

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
miniatures and that was to take a

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.490 
miniatures and that was to take a
blueprint<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.880> model<00:05:07.690> that<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:08.020> had<00:05:08.260> in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
blueprint of the model that we had in

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.080 
blueprint of the model that we had in
our<00:05:08.620> photo<00:05:08.860> library<00:05:08.950> we<00:05:09.430> had<00:05:09.550> an<00:05:09.640> image<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:10.000> the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
our photo library we had an image of the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.240 
our photo library we had an image of the
blueprint<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:11.020> we<00:05:11.110> took<00:05:11.290> that<00:05:11.470> in<00:05:11.620> enlarged<00:05:12.040> it

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
blueprint so we took that in enlarged it

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.040 
blueprint so we took that in enlarged it
kind<00:05:12.790> of<00:05:12.880> reversed<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.420> is<00:05:13.540> not<00:05:13.690> actually<00:05:14.020> a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
kind of reversed it is not actually a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.480 
kind of reversed it is not actually a
blueprint<00:05:14.440> image<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:14.920> then<00:05:15.070> put<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.460> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
blueprint image but then put it in the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.460 
blueprint image but then put it in the
background<00:05:15.790> here<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:16.780> that's<00:05:16.960> our<00:05:17.140> sort<00:05:17.440> of

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
background here so that's our sort of

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.200 
background here so that's our sort of
our<00:05:17.590> secret<00:05:18.010> way<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.190> showing<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.730> Nautilus<00:05:19.120> I

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
our secret way of showing the Nautilus I

don't<00:05:19.480> think<00:05:19.750> people<00:05:20.020> at<00:05:20.260> home<00:05:20.440> understand

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
don't think people at home understand

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.760 
don't think people at home understand
just<00:05:21.400> how<00:05:21.460> big<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:22.480> model<00:05:22.900> is<00:05:23.050> it's<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.560> bigger

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
just how big that model is it's a bigger

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.190 
just how big that model is it's a bigger
chair<00:05:24.070> yes<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.730> is<00:05:24.880> it's<00:05:25.180> about<00:05:25.360> 11<00:05:25.900> 12<00:05:26.110> feet

it's and heavy yes case has its own case

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.140 
it's and heavy yes case has its own case
that<00:05:32.980> we<00:05:33.070> had<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.280> have<00:05:33.370> specially<00:05:33.760> built<00:05:33.910> for

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
that we had to have specially built for

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.790 
that we had to have specially built for
it<00:05:34.240> yet<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.540> hold<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.350> touched<00:05:35.470> on<00:05:35.620> the

attractions mainly Epcot and the world
of<00:05:46.390> motion<00:05:46.750> there<00:05:47.410> we<00:05:47.530> have<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.650> couple<00:05:47.919> of<00:05:48.010> the

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
of motion there we have a couple of the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.500 
of motion there we have a couple of the
heads<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.400> were<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.729> actually<00:05:48.880> used<00:05:49.270> there

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
heads that were you actually used there

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.740 
heads that were you actually used there
in<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.840> attraction<00:05:50.729> cavemen<00:05:51.729> because<00:05:52.630> the
