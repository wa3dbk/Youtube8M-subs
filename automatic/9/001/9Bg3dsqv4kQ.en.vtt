00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.779
 move on to the next section which 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.629
 called account 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.429
 this section is important enough for you 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.420
 allows you to set up your first 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.880
 account 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.380
 change avatar then i have a picture which 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.320
 will be associated with your account 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.050
 by writing here you can for example create 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.540
 avatar using the camera program if u 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 you have a webcam you can run 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.980
 smile camera program and make 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 photo of yourself with her 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 accordingly this photo will be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.640
 used as avatar also 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 you can go to the people application and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 this application just take a photo 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.900
 from your account and upload it to your 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.210
 avatar in windows 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.890
 also you can use 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 Button review and select an image 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 already on the computer in which you will 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 use as your avatar 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.450
 Further login options in this section are you 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.150
 can change the password to your account 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.340
 record make it more reliable also 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.420
 it is possible to enable windows 8 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 graphic password 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.180
 what it is it when you specify 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 some points in the picture and for that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 to log into your operating system 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 you need to press these buttons very much 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 probably interesting and convenient if you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.380
 touch screen on a regular computer 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 this opportunity is absolutely useless well 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 and the rest of the parameters I think 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.650
 consider there is no point 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.130
 go to other accounts 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.460
 this section 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 necessary useful and interesting if for 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.119
 your computer to work and not only 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.340
 Well, you and other family members have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 sense to create some more credentials 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.659
 records for each member of your family in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 In this case, each member of your family 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.820
 can customize the look 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 operating system by themselves each 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.189
 a family member will be able to have his starter 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.470
 screen only with those tiles those 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.439
 applications he uses it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.869
 You can have your calendar and be able to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.080
 customize your skype and so on it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.360
 really convenient when to the computer 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.009
 has access to several people account 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.869
 recording is very easy to set up 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.659
 click on the add account button 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.419
 write here or write the address 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.219
 email or create a new one 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.090
 account by and large i 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.950
 probably not even 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.190
 I will consider an hour how it is done 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.360
 because if you watch the video in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.970
 which we installed 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 operating system then we are there with you 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.080
 done all the same thing to you now 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.360
 need to do the only thing 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.150
 if you want to create an account 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.840
 via microsoft and by recording 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.030
 microsoft 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.910
 then watch another video where we are with you 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.450
 created a microsoft account all 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.180
 here is done in exactly the same way 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.069
 skydrive section at least already said 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 when I looked at the skydrive program 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.660
 we also looked at the settings 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.900
 this application in the parameters 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.329
 computer search and applications this section 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 which is completely dedicated to searching and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.190
 according to the application here you are 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.410
 can set default search 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 which is used in windows often you 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.730
 understood this bing it is used and in 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.049
 Internet Explorer and even this site 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.989
 used in other applications 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.299
 such as sports finance news and so 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.030
 then you can adjust the level 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.470
 security or myth connections in general 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.180
 All these parameters are largely 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.180
 it makes no sense to touch 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.670
 they are configured by default quite 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.109
 ok and you can leave it as it is 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.000
 further share in this section 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.079
 is the parameters that you 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.269
 allow you to customize 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.010
 general access to various programs and 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 the application, that is, the whole output 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.780
 list of those programs with the help of which you 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.989
 can share any information with 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.579
 other people by other users 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.519
 I think that here, too, to change nothing 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.739
 I need notifications for this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.169
 The section contains notification settings 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.139
 which appear in the operating room 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.010
 all windows are listed here 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.989
 cases when 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.579
 notifications may appear 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.290
 operating system if any 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.329
 notification appears very often and 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.900
 they annoy you you can them 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.730
 disable 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.639
 for example, if any 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.040
 notification for example here is the game application 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.660
 and she annoys you you just 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.549
 turn off in this section 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.289
 and now the operating system is all 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.959
 Notifications of this application will be 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.239
 ignore move on size 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.440
 applications here by and large too 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.210
 nothing to tune 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.880
 it makes no sense because here we have 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.410
 Information about those applications is displayed. 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.600
 as 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.850
 mountains installed on the computer we 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.130
 here we see what kind of application we see 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.350
 how much does it take on the computer if 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.470
 we want to remove it just click on 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.940
 this application and click delete 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.520
 This application will be removed from 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.980
 computer the next item is enough 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.470
 important are programs or applications by 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.330
 default here we are setting up those 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.280
 programs to be used 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.000
 default operating system for 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.370
 work with certain files or for 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.800
 working with certain information 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.470
 for example , we have not chosen here 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.840
 default email if we are with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.440
 you click on this button and select 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.660
 post office 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.060
 Now we have the program mail will be 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.210
 programs by default email client 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.640
 possible for each event, select the 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.980
 the application to be used 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.900
 if the application you need is not listed 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.360
 then you can download 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.460
 store and find the app in the store 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.590
 there are also two references here 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.720
 you will be allowed to customize the standard 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.830
 applications for certain file types 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.370
 we choose and here we have such a sign in 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.040
 column displays the name and file extension 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.180
 in the default application column 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.540
 that application which will fall out 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.630
 associated in windows with this file 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.810
 that is, this application opens the file 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.490
 with this extension you can also 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.890
 In principle, do not change anything because 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.750
 if you need to open some file in 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.200
 another application you can do it 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.419
 using the context menu in one of 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.470
 lessons on working in windows explorer i 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.470
 told how to do it
