 open for all who want 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.970
 take part 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.590
 well we will enter first they have to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:57.500
 have the studio installed 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.500
 is what you download from the goal.com page 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.540
 they go to products 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.540
 they are forms of application 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.610
 and here is another study 2.0 here they go to 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.700
 See instructions on how to download 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.740
 the link to download the application a 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.230
 once they download it and install it in their 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.660
 good computer they are going to be ready 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.740
 I already have it installed so it happened to me 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.740
 directly to the application 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.600
 and we have those who had already used the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.850
 previous program the cinema forms study 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.180
 we see that is very much like not well 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.520
 that now we have one more step that is 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.830
 the step of editing and exporting if this 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.440
 previously we could use this 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.020
 study to trim our clips 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.590
 convert them and modify the colors 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.300
 and some things now I do by study 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.430
 in this edition he presents us this 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.970
 very easy to use program very 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.740
 fast and this one we can also edit 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.010
 you already have your timeline to be able 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.960
 add our music videos and texts 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.830
 and in a very simple and agile way 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:22.140
 to have a final video this very 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.360
 good quality and very very easy to handle 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.650
 basically what we have to do is 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.270
 knowing a little 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.490
 the structure of the program 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.770
 we have in this left window where 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.380
 let's have our our clips 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.560
 what we want in step 1 to import and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.140
 convert this area here is our 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.970
 viewer where we will be able to see our 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.540
 film our clips here we can 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.890
 adjust the timeline here in this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.700
 part is our conversion list 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.440
 then step number one is the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.310
 files that we have from our camera 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.700
 we cut them the raisins we put them 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.040
 some adjustments and we are going to convert them 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.740
 to a format that has no compression 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.600
 this format is much friendlier for 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.790
 able to work in the programs of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.700
 editing both the study group as 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.430
 other programs like freezer premieres the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.280
 final cut pro or any other program 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.870
 that they think of editing is a lot 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.340
 easier to work because it's the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 computer is no longer going to have to do 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.080
 the decompress process to be able to be 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.239
 showing on screen what what is 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.940
 happening in the video then if it's a 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.050
 file that start has much more 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.150
 more this mega 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.660
 the clip that they are going to convert but what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.790
 can make video adjustments this was going to 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.570
 work in a more natural way your 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.570
 editing program 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.800
 in step number 2 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.440
 this is where you are going to work 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.860
 this with your timeline that the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.860
 they can 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.950
 create from start from white 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.400
 so here we have a temple in 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.130
 white or we can choose between one of 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.020
 the many temples that there are from the 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.560
 chrome web page can be downloaded 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.850
 some right now I'm going blank 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.850
 and I'm going to create a project 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.249
 and we see quickly here here we have 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.610
 our clips our all our 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:30.539
 means such as music texts or 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.900
 videos 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:37.139
 we have here the buttons this button that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.670
 let's import this different music 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.490
 and videos 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.230
 and here we are going to generate our texts 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.340
 titles that we want to incorporate in 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.470
 our video 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.949
 we have here our line here 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.230
 of time that we simply slip or 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.540
 we move the video or the text that 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.880
 we want to put from our base of 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.669
 our part of middle elements to 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.130
 our timeline here we put the 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.020
 music here the videos and here in this 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.290
 we will see part of it once 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.290
 we have created all our movie 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.290
 we are just going to export 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.610
 then in three simple steps 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.820
 We import edit and export well of 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.040
 easy has put us as pro studio this 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.820
 this program 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.590
 here we have good in this menu we can 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.990
 open a project we can have several 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.150
 projects open at the same time 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.610
 they are fixed I already have two windows I can 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.610
 be working on two projects 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.610
 simultaneously 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.769
 can open my recent projects 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.199
 You can import elements from videos and 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:07.639
 music I can load upload a template 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.430
 close by projects save it 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.039
 save it as these are the options for 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.249
 edit undo and redo cut copy 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.020
 paste delete select all save my 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.979
 timeline that would be all this 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.979
 part of here below 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.140
 rise tablets is to clean all the 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.450
 specifications are the functions of 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.830
 the modifications that the fact to the 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.740
 videos 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.540
 in this part of here, then here 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.670
 can prescribe so that all are deleted 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.000
 those changes that I made 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:44.720
 this is the reproductions part is is 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.790
 quite useful that we know these let's say 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.010
 shortcuts or shortcut keys and I can 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.990
 put play pause implement moving the 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.790
 space bar I can stop the 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.610
 movie with the key here and the most 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.910
 fast with the jack with the l more this 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.830
 plan back and forth here 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.720
 I can between the different clips 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.790
 backward or forward 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.490
 The sea ​​king and the merchant are the most 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.920
 used in your together with the pause or the 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.330
 space bar this because it's going to 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.760
 mark the point of entering and the for 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.770
 exit point of our video 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.840
 this is to advance a square towards 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.570
 back in the timeline this is a 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.770
 box forward forward a box 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.960
 of our timeline in our 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.020
 movie this serves to divide if 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.840
 we have a clip this we are going to divide 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.870
 so that two clips are created and this is 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.770
 continuous reproduction of our line 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.660
 of time this this button is where we go 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.340
 to export we can export a 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.810
 movie or we can export a 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.880
 photograph of our video 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.740
 and good later in the next 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.590
 chapter let's see this others 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.710
 elements of this fabulous program that 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.450
 is the go pro studio 2.0 this thanks for 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:00.669
 visit us and my name is Diego
