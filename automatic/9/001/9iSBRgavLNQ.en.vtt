00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:20.600
 no no no no 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.780
 no no no no 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.440
 [Music] 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.440
 [Applause] 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.840
 we are about reform in a fir tree 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.070
 formula-1 remember that since 1992 no 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.470
 we have had formula still in mexico 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 we have nelson piquet and he was also 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.879
 giancarlo fisichella with us 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 serving more or less narrow the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.090
 reform 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.830
 speaking of that we are talking about 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.990
 these professional sounds pilots of 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.460
 formula 1 that have been in Monaco that 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.910
 is much narrower than the walk of the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.820
 reform 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.160
 here we have a little more open the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.170
 lane where these pilots are going to run 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.090
 but if we put to the test what 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's Monaco as such in Monaco the pilot 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.180
 that they naturally lose their way 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.720
 race and these pilots like 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.070
 professionals do not give you less than 300 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.509
 laps the weekend I was in 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.250
 Monaco so talking about experience 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.800
 it's only for people who can be 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.240
 in a street circuit even though 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.610
 have not practiced that are not 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.530
 calculated and naturally you already know that 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.390
 how is the Monaco good bet 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 because it can be very similar because there 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 two very tight turns especially 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 where the target hunter is is a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.740
 turn practically not something that I already 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.350
 knows very well precisely from Monaco 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.560
 there are many laps of this type 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.560
 in the engine of this volcano 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.009
 [Music] 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 plus 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.159
 today we have to see what will be the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 development because we remember that the 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.659
 Formula 1 there are almost 700 horses 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.250
 strength with impressive torque and a 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.719
 speed that good surely the end 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.640
 of the small lines that we have here 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.540
 they can not be less than 250 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.540
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 very good 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 [Music] 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.830
 the monkey dan started in mexico in the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.720
 formula 1 and they started to adopt all 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.250
 the track officials of the world and this 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.900
 consists in greeting with the flags of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.120
 colors to all the pilots after 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.560
 finish the race in Mexico now to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.270
 from the champions that has been 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.860
 visiting mexico has been 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.570
 presenting the elder monkey with 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.690
 all flags but with white green 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.690
 and red
