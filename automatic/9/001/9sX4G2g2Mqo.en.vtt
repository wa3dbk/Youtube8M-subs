know<00:01:14.390> for<00:01:14.780> 21<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> little<00:01:15.440> bit<00:01:15.560> higher<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.770> could

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
know for 21 a little bit higher I could

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.219

be<00:01:16.310> tempted<00:01:16.789> obviously<00:01:17.690> she<00:01:17.840> she's<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.050> little

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
be tempted obviously she she's a little

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.889 
be tempted obviously she she's a little
bit<00:01:18.410> lower<00:01:18.560> than<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:19.509> but<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.720> case

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
bit lower than that but there's a case

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.210 
bit lower than that but there's a case
you<00:01:21.050> can<00:01:21.200> make<00:01:21.349> for<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.649> mean<00:01:21.830> she's<00:01:22.039> going<00:01:22.160> to

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
thing went over I think motivation is on

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.249 
thing went over I think motivation is on
her<00:01:43.190> side<00:01:43.479> but<00:01:44.479> at<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.599> same<00:01:44.810> time<00:01:44.989> I<00:01:45.050> don't

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
her side but at the same time I don't

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.139 
her side but at the same time I don't
want<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.560> gamble<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.310> gamble<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.759> don't

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
want to gamble just a gamble I don't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.580 
want to gamble just a gamble I don't
feel<00:01:47.360> like<00:01:47.509> she<00:01:47.690> really<00:01:47.810> has<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.080> great<00:01:48.349> of<00:01:48.530> a

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
feel like she really has that great of a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.020 
feel like she really has that great of a
chance<00:01:48.830> here<00:01:49.099> Ronda<00:01:49.429> Rousey<00:01:49.580> has<00:01:49.819> been<00:01:49.910> able

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
chance here Ronda Rousey has been able

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.620 
chance here Ronda Rousey has been able
to<00:01:50.239> do<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.259> same<00:01:51.440> thing<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.830> every<00:01:52.069> opponent

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
to do the same thing to every opponent

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.300 
to do the same thing to every opponent
you<00:01:53.630> could<00:01:53.959> maybe<00:01:54.140> say<00:01:54.410> Kaufman's<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.190> her

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
you could maybe say Kaufman's that her

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.249 
you could maybe say Kaufman's that her
toughest<00:01:55.700> test<00:01:55.940> yet<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.209> don't<00:01:56.690> necessarily

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
toughest test yet I don't necessarily

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.570 
toughest test yet I don't necessarily
think<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.679> think<00:01:57.770> she's<00:01:58.069> gonna<00:01:58.160> be<00:01:58.310> able<00:01:58.399> to

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
think so I think she's gonna be able to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.609 
think so I think she's gonna be able to
you<00:01:58.759> know<00:01:58.880> take<00:01:59.330> her<00:01:59.479> down<00:01:59.660> get<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> arm<00:02:00.380> bar
