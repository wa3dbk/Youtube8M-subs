00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
putting in a good analogy to this is the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.600 
putting in a good analogy to this is the
race<00:01:20.490> car<00:01:20.850> driver<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.799> bad<00:01:23.159> fuel

race car driver if they put in bad fuel

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.630 
race car driver if they put in bad fuel
to<00:01:23.790> their<00:01:23.939> car<00:01:24.439> doesn't<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.500> enough<00:01:25.830> octane

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to their car doesn't have enough octane

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240 
to their car doesn't have enough octane
or<00:01:27.030> whatever<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.840> technical<00:01:28.350> specifications

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
or whatever the technical specifications

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.160 
or whatever the technical specifications
are<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> car<00:01:31.650> doesn't<00:01:32.369> run<00:01:32.430> well

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
are for that the car doesn't run well

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
are for that the car doesn't run well
same<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.439> true<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.650> our<00:01:34.829> bodies<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.640> we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
same thing is true with our bodies if we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
same thing is true with our bodies if we
don't<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.799> good<00:01:37.799> food<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:39.530> nutrition

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
don't put in good food good nutrition

don't put in good food good nutrition
our<00:01:40.799> bodies<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.850> run<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:42.960> should

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
our bodies don't run like they should

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
our bodies don't run like they should
you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.060> apply<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.110> increasing<00:01:46.770> better

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you can apply that to increasing better

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
you can apply that to increasing better
health<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.759> apply<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.689> whatever

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
health you can apply that to whatever

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.069 
health you can apply that to whatever
you<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> simple<00:01:51.659> fact<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you want but the simple fact of the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.600 
you want but the simple fact of the
matter<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:54.090> crap<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.610> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
matter is that if you put crap in you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.130 
matter is that if you put crap in you
get<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> crappy<00:01:57.180> body<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:59.360> food<00:02:00.360> journaling<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
get a crappy body so food journaling is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.330 
get a crappy body so food journaling is
a<00:02:01.460> particular<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.619> looking<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a particular way of looking at what is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059 
a particular way of looking at what is
going<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:07.409> gives<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> way<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going in and then it gives you a way to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.530 
going in and then it gives you a way to
analyze<00:02:08.840> what<00:02:09.840> choices<00:02:10.170> you've<00:02:10.530> made<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
analyze what choices you've made and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.900 
analyze what choices you've made and
look<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.840> what

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
look at what

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.700 
look at what
possibly<00:02:14.600> be<00:02:14.840> better<00:02:15.760> or<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.960> can<00:02:18.110> also<00:02:18.320> look

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
possibly be better or you can also look

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.010 
possibly be better or you can also look
at<00:02:18.980> what<00:02:19.630> situations<00:02:21.550> caused<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.360> what

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
at what situations caused you to do what

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.630 
at what situations caused you to do what
you<00:02:24.230> did<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.850> good<00:02:26.540> analogy<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you did a good analogy for this is you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.630 
you did a good analogy for this is you
know<00:02:28.760> if<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.210> do<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.110> same<00:02:30.410> thing<00:02:30.470> over<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
know if you do the same thing over and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.670 
know if you do the same thing over and
over<00:02:32.060> again<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.960> expect<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.560> different

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
over again and you expect a different

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.580 
over again and you expect a different
result<00:02:34.810> according<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.840> some<00:02:36.080> groups<00:02:36.350> that's

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
result according to some groups that's

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.540 
result according to some groups that's
the<00:02:36.740> definition<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.310> insanity<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:39.550> in

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
the definition of insanity so in

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.940 
the definition of insanity so in
journaling<00:02:41.270> if<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.140> actually<00:02:42.380> write<00:02:42.770> down

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
journaling if you actually write down

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.060 
journaling if you actually write down
what<00:02:43.100> you're<00:02:43.250> doing<00:02:43.580> you'll<00:02:44.620> take<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.800> from

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
what you're doing you'll take it from
