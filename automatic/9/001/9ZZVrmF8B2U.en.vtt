of<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.830> things<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:50.940> done<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
of the things I have done so I have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.090 
of the things I have done so I have
taken<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.960> dirt<00:02:55.590> road<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.530> just<00:02:58.530> gonna<00:02:58.800> draw

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
taken the dirt road and just gonna draw

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.450 
taken the dirt road and just gonna draw
some<00:02:59.340> crazy<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:01.230> roads<00:03:01.470> here<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.740> medium

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
some crazy little roads here a medium

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.210 
some crazy little roads here a medium
density<00:03:02.670> Street

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
density Street

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.450 
density Street
now<00:03:05.220> what<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> did<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:06.120> based<00:03:06.540> off<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.350> was<00:03:08.010> if

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
now what I did this based off of was if

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.620 
now what I did this based off of was if
there<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.850> say<00:03:09.120> one<00:03:09.600> lane<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.520> this<00:03:11.520> has<00:03:12.030> four

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
there is say one lane here this has four

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.949 
there is say one lane here this has four
so<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.770> tried<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.150> based<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.620> lanes<00:03:17.959> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
so I tried to go up based on the lanes I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.550 
so I tried to go up based on the lanes I
didn't<00:03:19.470> want<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.800> go<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.720> tried<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.900> also<00:03:22.350> go

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
didn't want to go up I tried to also go

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.340 
didn't want to go up I tried to also go
up<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.860> well<00:03:23.160> by<00:03:23.600> density<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.620> found<00:03:26.100> that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
up as well by density but I found that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.770 
up as well by density but I found that
doing<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.500> by<00:03:28.770> lanes<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.030> low<00:03:30.540> density

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
doing this by lanes in a low density

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.590 
doing this by lanes in a low density
Street<00:03:31.290> medium<00:03:31.620> density<00:03:31.950> Avenue<00:03:32.600> provides

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
Street medium density Avenue provides

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.720 
Street medium density Avenue provides
more<00:03:33.900> lanes<00:03:35.930> everything<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.110> sorts<00:03:37.770> when

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
more lanes everything of that sorts when

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
more lanes everything of that sorts when
you<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.300> high<00:03:39.510> density<00:03:40.100> straight<00:03:42.050> which

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
you have the high density straight which

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.960 
you have the high density straight which
upgraded<00:03:46.220> takes<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.610> high<00:03:47.760> density

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
upgraded takes it to the high density

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.240 
upgraded takes it to the high density
Avenue<00:03:48.690> instead<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.230> having<00:03:49.410> nothing

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
Avenue instead of having nothing

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.540 
Avenue instead of having nothing
so<00:03:51.320> now<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.350> tried<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.670> get<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.959> high<00:03:55.230> density

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
so now I tried to get the high density

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.930 
so now I tried to get the high density
Avenue<00:03:56.550> or<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.030> hive

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
Avenue or the hive

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.199 
Avenue or the hive
whichever<00:03:58.940> way<00:03:59.390> the<00:04:00.200> regional<00:04:00.830> freeway<00:04:01.520> road

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
whichever way the regional freeway road

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.370 
whichever way the regional freeway road
by<00:04:02.510> sky<00:04:02.959> storm<00:04:03.380> but<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.340> found<00:04:05.330> that<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:05.720> crashes

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
by sky storm but I found that it crashes

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.530 
by sky storm but I found that it crashes
your<00:04:06.620> game<00:04:06.860> messes<00:04:07.700> up<00:04:07.880> your<00:04:08.060> screen

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
your game messes up your screen

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.220 
your game messes up your screen
resolution<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:11.090> completely<00:04:11.569> jacked<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.080> if

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
resolution it's completely jacked up if

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.430 
resolution it's completely jacked up if
you<00:04:12.350> tried<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.740> upgrade<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.080> wanted<00:04:15.319> to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
you tried to upgrade so I just wanted to

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.300 
you tried to upgrade so I just wanted to
show<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:15.980> give<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> quick<00:04:17.299> little

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
show you this give you a quick little

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.480 
show you this give you a quick little
perspective<00:04:19.310> here<00:04:20.829> now<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:21.889> can<00:04:22.010> get<00:04:22.340> this

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
perspective here now you can get this

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.900 
perspective here now you can get this
upgraded<00:04:23.360> now<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.110> didn't<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:24.560> to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
upgraded now I didn't want to

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.140 
upgraded now I didn't want to
technically<00:04:25.940> choose<00:04:26.360> for<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.290> but<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.160> assume

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
technically choose for you but I assume

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.310 
technically choose for you but I assume
that<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:31.780> mean<00:04:32.780> unless<00:04:34.750> everybody<00:04:35.750> wants<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
that I mean unless everybody wants the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.620 
that I mean unless everybody wants the
choice<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.890> be<00:04:37.040> totally<00:04:37.370> different<00:04:38.180> than<00:04:38.419> I

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
choice it to be totally different than I

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.230 
choice it to be totally different than I
guess<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:39.200> will<00:04:39.620> make<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.190> choices<00:04:40.490> different

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
guess I will make the choices different

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.170 
guess I will make the choices different
but<00:04:41.600> that's<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.890> now<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.040> would<00:04:43.520> like<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.790> keep

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
but that's and now I would like to keep

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.920 
but that's and now I would like to keep
them<00:04:44.480> at<00:04:44.990> where<00:04:45.440> they're<00:04:45.680> at<00:04:45.860> now<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.600> will

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
them at where they're at now and I will

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.450 
them at where they're at now and I will
update<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.710> mod<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:50.560> do<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.590> few<00:04:52.250> little

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
update this mod to do a few little

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.690 
update this mod to do a few little
tweaks<00:04:52.820> with<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.660> see<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.700> messes

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
tweaks with it and see if it messes

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.090 
tweaks with it and see if it messes
anything<00:04:56.330> up<00:04:56.540> or<00:04:56.870> could<00:04:57.560> use<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> little

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
anything up or could use a little

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.000 
anything up or could use a little
upgrade<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:01.840> really<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:02.990> isn't<00:05:03.410> anything

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
upgrade and really this isn't anything

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.150 
upgrade and really this isn't anything
too<00:05:05.000> major<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:06.140> just<00:05:06.410> wanted<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.800> give<00:05:07.010> you

too major but I just wanted to give you
a<00:05:07.190> nice<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:07.700> mod<00:05:08.229> in<00:05:09.229> case<00:05:09.440> you<00:05:09.680> didn't
