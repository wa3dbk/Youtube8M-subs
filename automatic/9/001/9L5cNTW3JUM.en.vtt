 with enamels the family is always bad 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.860
 It has been characterized by having telephones 

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:26.270
 Very good quality price ratio are 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.680
 most commented entry phones and 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.250
 let's use it for a few days 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 to see how it works 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.310
 well let's go first to open the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310
 package that is going down 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.160
 well the first thing also open it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.610
 we found with the phone 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.040
 it's a 4-inch phone it 's pretty 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.020
 big is not the little ones we can 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.280
 find by price but with 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.580
 four heights we are talking about the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.620
 very very usable smartphone colombianos a 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.990
 my taste we are going to take it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.930
 today plastiquito 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.970
 let's leave it here the 5 camera 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.320
 megapixels we'll see how it works with the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.140
 flash 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.220
 value 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.400
 part of the camera we found 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.070
 with a charger charger we can 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.380
 use any usb cable that is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.120
 very well because we can not if we lose 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.120
 the cable we can use any 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.370
 then here we have 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.180
 some helmets with the system to be able 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.770
 make the calls and we'll see what 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 it works 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.640
 we are leaving 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.510
 so that a cable like 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.120
 always the micro usb the good thing that has 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.400
 is that we can use any that 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.200
 we have at home you do not have to have 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.710
 to be carrying and then finally 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.070
 thing that we are 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.440
 then one of tfc since the phone 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.789
 it also takes something quite useful 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.969
 Well, a little guide 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.400
 Well let's use it for 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.560
 a few days and we will record the second 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.099
 part of the video looking to see how we 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.099
 it has appeared 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.520
 we have been a few days with the new 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.830
 vodafone smart 3 and we are going to review a 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.880
 little because it seemed to us first 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.490
 see its characteristics 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 we are talking about how is the first 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.150
 part of the video of a phone with 4 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.450
 inches with a resolution of 400% 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.790
 has a screen that is very good and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.590
 which in others is Mar 3 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.150
 the esparto will be raffles with 2 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.909
 inches to what I was doing to myself 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.159
 short but with 4 inches the truth is 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.129
 that a smartphone is very good and 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.459
 for the end what you need is power 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.310
 have content and with this phone 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.920
 Well, the truth is that it is very good if 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.760
 we see visually we have here the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.459
 standard sd micro charger here 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.709
 the three google buttons the light of 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.220
 what we see is that the design of the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.650
 phone is very good is something 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.829
 different from what we normally move 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.310
 with here a small highlighted here we have 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:31.420
 the voice buttons was for the ignition 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.239
 for the microphone and here already what is 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.280
 the camera and the flash the camera we have 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.810
 to talk about that is 5 megapixels and 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.510
 pretty good quality camera 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.220
 to take pictures the phone 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.830
 internally it carried a processor of a 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:51.530
 gigahercio and 4 gigas how good it is 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.110
 is that we can increase capacity with 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.340
 the microsd cards is a phone that 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.489
 reacts very well we can see that the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.209
 operating system that is a 34.1 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.590
 they react right away without delays 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.349
 it works quite well for the use 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.900
 normal both social networks as 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.710
 can be twitter as it can be 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.020
 facebook example 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.150
 we can also all that is 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.250
 messaging communications by chat 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.280
 Well, he also does not have any 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.300
 problem the games the latest games 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.080
 with 3d graphics because we can not go 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.940
 okay so it's the east but 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 games like for example 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.120
 of the flu is the trivial trainer 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.130
 or the rock club that are that way 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.020
 famous then and you do not need a 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.320
 big graphical power because we see that 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.300
 they work without any delay 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.520
 well, we're definitely talking about 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.910
 a phone that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.009
 what is trying to get the best 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.520
 quality-price and vodafone gets it 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.830
 with that price but not very well designed 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.039
 and that is not as it used to be 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.470
 we could say of telephones that 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.860
 they came right to the limit of use but 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.169
 that for the day to day use of 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.720
 any kind even a relationship then 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.350
 works 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.320
 thank you very much for your attention but see 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.820
 more often on smartphone and if you like 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.820
 have many
