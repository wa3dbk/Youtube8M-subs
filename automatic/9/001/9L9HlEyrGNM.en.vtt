making<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.800> big<00:00:34.829> deal<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.030> summer

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
making a big deal out of it this summer

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.490 
making a big deal out of it this summer
I<00:00:36.390> still<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.929> the<00:00:37.019> same<00:00:37.260> type<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
I still think it's the same type of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.189 
I still think it's the same type of
situation<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.149> good<00:00:39.210> office<00:00:39.690> two

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
situation of two very good office two

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.979 
situation of two very good office two
very<00:00:40.410> good<00:00:40.530> offenses<00:00:41.039> to<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:42.149> questionable

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
very good offenses to very questionable

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
very good offenses to very questionable

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
defenses which defense do you think

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
defenses which defense do you think
might<00:00:45.359> be<00:00:45.480> better<00:00:45.660> view<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.890> hard

might be better view you know it's hard

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
might be better view you know it's hard

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
would agree with you that Michigan

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.969 
would agree with you that Michigan
somehow<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.299> better<00:01:30.719> experience<00:01:31.469> in<00:01:31.799> their

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
somehow has better experience in their

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
somehow has better experience in their
secondary<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.149> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.899> in<00:01:34.079> some<00:01:34.289> ways

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
secondary which is kind of in some ways

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.039 
secondary which is kind of in some ways
ridiculous<00:01:34.950> considering<00:01:35.280> their<00:01:35.670> youth

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
ridiculous considering their youth

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.060 
ridiculous considering their youth
however<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.469> just<00:01:38.039> think<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.310> Indiana

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
however I just think that Indiana

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.620 
however I just think that Indiana
offensively<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.369> unlike<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.149> team<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
offensively is unlike a team that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
offensively is unlike a team that
Michigan<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.680> faced<00:01:43.860> before<00:01:44.219> they<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.939> an

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Michigan is faced before they have an

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.300 
Michigan is faced before they have an
extremely<00:01:45.570> accurate<00:01:46.200> passer<00:01:46.560> event<00:01:46.829> chapel

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
extremely accurate passer event chapel

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.029 
extremely accurate passer event chapel
they<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.149> very<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:49.020> versatile<00:01:49.530> talented

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
they have a very very versatile talented

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.010 
they have a very very versatile talented

to<00:02:02.789> him<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> he's<00:02:03.240> got<00:02:03.420> incredible<00:02:03.570> hands

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
to him and he's got incredible hands

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.560 
to him and he's got incredible hands
he's<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.039> guy<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.210> Michigan's<00:02:06.210> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
he's the guy that Michigan's really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.360 
he's the guy that Michigan's really
going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> need<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> account

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
going to need to account

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.609 
going to need to account
they<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.790> handle<00:02:08.180> him<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.690> making<00:02:09.020> maybe<00:02:09.380> get

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
they can handle him and making maybe get

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.170 
they can handle him and making maybe get
some<00:02:09.770> pressure<00:02:10.040> finally<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.820> quarterback

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
some pressure finally on a quarterback

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.150 
some pressure finally on a quarterback
and<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.870> fluster<00:02:12.410> chapel<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.830> little<00:02:13.010> bit<00:02:13.130> I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and and fluster chapel a little bit I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.010 
and and fluster chapel a little bit I
think<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:13.490> have<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> really<00:02:13.850> good<00:02:14.030> chance<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
think they have a really good chance to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.750 
think they have a really good chance to
maybe<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> couple<00:02:15.950> couple<00:02:16.400> touchdown

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
maybe have a couple couple touchdown

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.370 
maybe have a couple couple touchdown
victory<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.390> otherwise<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.870> think<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.260> could

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
victory but otherwise I think it could

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.350 
victory but otherwise I think it could
be<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.830> shootout<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.670> then<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.940> would<00:02:20.060> say<00:02:20.180> by

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
be a shootout and then you would say by

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.880 
be a shootout and then you would say by
the<00:02:20.420> same<00:02:20.660> token<00:02:20.930> miss<00:02:21.320> lady<00:02:21.530> enjoys

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the same token miss lady enjoys

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.890

I<00:02:47.030> think<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.270> defenses<00:02:47.750> are<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> big

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
I think the defenses are the big

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.990 
I think the defenses are the big
question<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:49.100> i<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.370> michigan's<00:02:49.850> offense

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
question but i like michigan's offense

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.880 
question but i like michigan's offense
and<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.780> michigan's<00:02:51.350> defense<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.860> a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
and I think that michigan's defense is a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.010 
and I think that michigan's defense is a
little<00:02:52.310> bit<00:02:52.460> better<00:02:52.640> than<00:02:52.940> Indiana<00:02:53.330> CFS<00:02:53.810> not

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
little bit better than Indiana CFS not

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.840 
little bit better than Indiana CFS not
much<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.740> little<00:02:54.800> bit<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.430> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.820> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
much but a little bit it's going to be a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.040 
much but a little bit it's going to be a
shoe<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.420> going<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.600> be<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> close<00:02:57.020> game

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050
