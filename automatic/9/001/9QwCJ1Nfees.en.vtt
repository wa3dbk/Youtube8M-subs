a 200 degrees grill says it's a 210 I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.790 
a 200 degrees grill says it's a 210 I
have<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.609> Mavericks<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.480> says<00:00:27.689> 216<00:00:28.410> one

minutes when I started it I'd say it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
minutes when I started it I'd say it
probably<00:00:35.250> took<00:00:35.430> maybe<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> minute<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> most

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
probably took maybe a minute at the most

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
probably took maybe a minute at the most
before<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.320> started<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:37.860> smelling<00:00:38.750> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
before I started actually smelling the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440 
before I started actually smelling the
pellets<00:00:40.110> start<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> smolder<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.129> within<00:00:42.030> 10

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
pellets start to smolder and within 10

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.310 
pellets start to smolder and within 10
minutes<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.899> 200<00:00:45.899> which<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
minutes it was up to 200 which is what I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
minutes it was up to 200 which is what I
have<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.649> set<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> grates<00:00:50.489> evened<00:00:50.910> out

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
have it set at and the grates evened out

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
have it set at and the grates evened out
very<00:00:51.300> quickly<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:52.260> I'll<00:00:52.379> show<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> where

very quickly here I'll show you where
the<00:00:53.570> probes<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.110> where<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the probes are that's where I have the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
the probes are that's where I have the
left<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.370> where<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> right

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
left one that's where I have the right

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
left one that's where I have the right
one<00:00:58.070> smoke<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.309> eye<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:01.350> thing<00:01:01.559> smokes

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
within 10 minutes and they would have

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
within 10 minutes and they would have

of<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.700> bull<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of here at bull you know how like the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
of here at bull you know how like the
combustion<00:01:24.960> starts<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> it'll<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
combustion starts and it'll go for a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.920 
combustion starts and it'll go for a
little<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> almost<00:01:27.509> seems<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
little bit and then it almost seems like

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
little bit and then it almost seems like
it<00:01:28.110> dies<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.310> crazy<00:01:29.490> almost

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it dies down it's really crazy almost

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
it dies down it's really crazy almost
like<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.270> oven<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:31.770> never

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
like what your oven does I've never

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.060 
like what your oven does I've never
heard<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.220> pellet<00:01:32.579> cooker<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> before

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
heard of pellet cooker do that before

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
heard of pellet cooker do that before
but<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> me<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> almost<00:01:36.900> seems<00:01:37.229> like

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but I had it to me it almost seems like

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
but I had it to me it almost seems like
it<00:01:37.470> helps<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.270> then<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.540> get

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it helps because then you don't get

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
it helps because then you don't get
these<00:01:39.780> huge<00:01:40.079> 10<00:01:40.500> swings<00:01:40.829> where<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> know

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
these huge 10 swings where if you know

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
these huge 10 swings where if you know
ramps<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> controller

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
ramps way up and then the controller

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
ramps way up and then the controller
fights<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> bring<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> back<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:45.110> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
fights to bring it back down again it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
fights to bring it back down again it
really<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.890> sets<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:47.549> grill

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
really just sets in there again grill

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.960 
really just sets in there again grill
temp<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> 210<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:49.560> we're<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.799> 215<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.399> 221

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
temp is 210 then we're at 215 and 221

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
temp is 210 then we're at 215 and 221
and<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.810> opened<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> lid<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.860> and

the updated flame zone kit and I got
foil<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.300> said<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.630> gonna<00:02:12.720> run<00:02:12.960> a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
foil on it so they said it's gonna run a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.540 
foil on it so they said it's gonna run a
little<00:02:13.200> hotter<00:02:13.320> at<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> great<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:14.340> that's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
little hotter at the great but that's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.070 
little hotter at the great but that's
fine<00:02:14.820> as<00:02:15.030> long<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> figure<00:02:16.050> out

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
fine as long as I can kind of figure out

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.980 
fine as long as I can kind of figure out
the<00:02:16.350> grill<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.000> behaves<00:02:18.390> then<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
the grill I know how it behaves then I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.080 
the grill I know how it behaves then I
can<00:02:19.170> adjust<00:02:19.500> accordingly<00:02:19.610> that's<00:02:20.610> why<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> set

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
can adjust accordingly that's why I set

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520 
can adjust accordingly that's why I set
it<00:02:21.210> at<00:02:21.300> 200<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.050> wanted<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> be

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it at 200 because I wanted to be

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.280 
it at 200 because I wanted to be
somewhere<00:02:22.860> around<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:24.060> 20<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.570> 25<00:02:24.990> at<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
somewhere around to 20 to 25 at the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.980 
somewhere around to 20 to 25 at the
grate<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.890> looks<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.100> I'm<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.520> be

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
grate and it looks like I'm gonna be

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
grate and it looks like I'm gonna be

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
with these plants here but I decided to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.180 
with these plants here but I decided to
aim<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.360> fan<00:02:51.989> away<00:02:52.350> from<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.800> incoming
