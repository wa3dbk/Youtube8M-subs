00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
you can't they're down in the hole i'll

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.060 
you can't they're down in the hole i'll
explain<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.089> in<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.359> second<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.480> um<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:05.920> now

explain that in a second so um so now

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.050 
explain that in a second so um so now
they're<00:01:06.250> done<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.410> what<00:01:08.410> this<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.880> are

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
they're done and what this is these are

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.200 
they're done and what this is these are
coordinates<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:10.900> black<00:01:11.260> black<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.700> think<00:01:13.150> of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
coordinates so black black so think of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.080 
coordinates so black black so think of
it<00:01:13.300> as<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.950> map<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.190> X<00:01:15.850> Y<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:18.220> do<00:01:18.340> black<00:01:18.670> combo

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
it as a map so X Y so I do black combo

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.210 
it as a map so X Y so I do black combo
black<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.870> will<00:01:20.140> trigger<00:01:20.410> these<00:01:20.770> two<00:01:21.010> pieces

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
black it will trigger these two pieces

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.570 
black it will trigger these two pieces
of<00:01:21.460> red<00:01:21.730> stone<00:01:22.000> which<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.110> end<00:01:23.580> will

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
of red stone which in the end will

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.210 
of red stone which in the end will
trigger<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.450> gate<00:01:25.720> below<00:01:26.320> there<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.130> if

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
trigger that and gate below there so if

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
trigger that and gate below there so if
i<00:01:27.310> step<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.640> here<00:01:27.930> it'll<00:01:28.930> hit<00:01:29.080> some<00:01:29.260> command

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
i step on here it'll hit some command

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.370 
i step on here it'll hit some command
blocks<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.430> teleport<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:31.150> me<00:01:31.330> teleport<00:01:32.230> me<00:01:32.350> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.979 
might have noticed this there's no TMT
that<00:02:25.709> goes<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.040> um<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:27.720> would<00:02:27.810> actually

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
that goes here um that would actually

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.750 
that goes here um that would actually
screw<00:02:28.410> up<00:02:28.500> everything<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.130> play<00:02:29.310> C&amp;T

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
screw up everything if you play C&amp;T

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.449 
screw up everything if you play C&amp;T
there<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.569> CMT<00:02:31.080> would<00:02:31.950> land<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.280> this

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
there because the CMT would land on this

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.940 
there because the CMT would land on this
causing<00:02:32.940> massive<00:02:33.420> explosion<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.800> don't

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
causing massive explosion so you don't

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
causing massive explosion so you don't
want<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.849> good<00:02:36.000> idea<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.269> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
want that there it's a good idea not to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
want that there it's a good idea not to
have<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.010> push<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> button

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
have it and then just push the button

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.600 
have it and then just push the button
and<00:02:38.730> fly<00:02:39.299> off<00:02:39.450> actually<00:02:40.250> increase<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.370> few

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and fly off actually increase my few

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.520 
and fly off actually increase my few
distance<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.900> actually<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.200> what's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
distance so you can actually see what's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:53.839 
distance so you can actually see what's
happening<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:52.560> am<00:02:52.769> launching<00:02:53.099> very<00:02:53.519> far

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
happening and I am launching very far

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.089 
happening and I am launching very far
you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.410> what<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> map<00:02:55.860> looks

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
you can see this is what the map looks

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.350 
you can see this is what the map looks
like<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:59.069> shoots<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.610> high<00:02:59.760> I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
like and it shoots you up that high I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.750 
like and it shoots you up that high I
haven't<00:03:00.989> tested<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.739> creative<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
haven't tested on the creative or a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.259 
haven't tested on the creative or a
survival<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.660> actually<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.890> us<00:03:04.980> us<00:03:05.160> off<00:03:05.340> so

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
survival so actually get us us off so

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.240 
survival so actually get us us off so
let<00:03:06.540> me<00:03:06.569> build<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.900> real<00:03:07.079> quick

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.720 

okay<00:03:16.250> it's<00:03:16.820> built<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.950> let's<00:03:18.950> go<00:03:19.550> into

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
okay it's built so let's go into

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:30.430 
okay it's built so let's go into
creative<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.870> let's<00:03:24.470> see<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.800> die<00:03:29.440> probably

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
creative and let's see if I die probably

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.590 
creative and let's see if I die probably
yeah<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:30.800> think<00:03:31.040> I'm<00:03:31.310> gonna<00:03:31.490> die<00:03:31.700> no<00:03:32.360> one<00:03:32.390> came

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
yeah I think I'm gonna die no one came

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.880 
yeah I think I'm gonna die no one came
Oh<00:03:33.910> hold<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.350> don't<00:03:36.350> think<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.650> was

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
Oh hold on I don't think that was

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.050 
Oh hold on I don't think that was
supposed<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.310> happen<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.880> didn't<00:03:38.840> die<00:03:40.060> well

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
supposed to happen I didn't die well

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.970 
supposed to happen I didn't die well
maybe<00:03:41.180> i<00:03:41.300> will<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:41.600> maybe<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.380> was<00:03:42.530> enough

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
maybe i will now maybe that was enough

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.850 
maybe i will now maybe that was enough
update<00:03:43.580> before<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.270> you<00:03:44.510> won't<00:03:44.930> die<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.740> t

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
update before that you won't die can t

confused well so that's the first one
the<00:03:57.709> second<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:58.550> is<00:04:00.490> it's<00:04:01.490> a<00:04:01.820> reward<00:04:02.450> bomb

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
builder now if you don't know what a war

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.510 
builder now if you don't know what a war
reward<00:04:05.060> bomb<00:04:05.300> is<00:04:05.600> reward<00:04:06.260> bomb<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.860> very<00:04:07.250> neat

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
reward bomb is reward bomb is very neat

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.350 
reward bomb is reward bomb is very neat
I<00:04:07.670> came<00:04:07.940> up<00:04:08.060> with<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.360> myself<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:10.360> someone

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
I came up with this myself but someone

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.600 
I came up with this myself but someone
could<00:04:11.630> have<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.020> before<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.530> haven't<00:04:13.400> looked

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
could have it before I haven't looked

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.030 
could have it before I haven't looked
but<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.330> think<00:04:15.020> it's<00:04:15.140> really<00:04:15.230> neat<00:04:15.500> or<00:04:16.459> anybody

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
but I think it's really neat or anybody

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.740 
but I think it's really neat or anybody
so<00:04:19.040> what<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.609> do<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:20.030> give<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:20.600> some

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
so what you do is you give it some

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.400 
so what you do is you give it some
distance<00:04:21.280> put<00:04:22.280> TNT<00:04:22.730> right<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.330> ring<00:04:24.290> them

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
distance put TNT right there ring them

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.940 
distance put TNT right there ring them
and<00:04:24.650> then<00:04:25.280> just<00:04:25.490> surround<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.660> kimchi<00:04:27.650> with

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
and then just surround the kimchi with

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.030 
and then just surround the kimchi with
either<00:04:28.490> diamond<00:04:29.120> door<00:04:29.240> red<00:04:29.630> stone<00:04:29.870> or<00:04:30.050> some

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
either diamond door red stone or some

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.700 
either diamond door red stone or some
kind<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.280> or<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.669> gives<00:04:31.850> XP<00:04:32.360> like<00:04:32.930> coal<00:04:33.320> but

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
kind of or that gives XP like coal but

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.300 
kind of or that gives XP like coal but
you<00:04:33.919> don't<00:04:34.100> want<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.280> do<00:04:34.400> like<00:04:34.580> iron<00:04:34.970> or<00:04:35.090> gold

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
you don't want to do like iron or gold

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.430 
you don't want to do like iron or gold
so<00:04:37.310> when<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.760> dig<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:37.970> you'll<00:04:38.240> get<00:04:38.419> XD<00:04:38.720> because

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
so when you dig it you'll get XD because

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.650 
so when you dig it you'll get XD because
when<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.010> TNT<00:04:40.400> goes<00:04:40.610> off<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.120> will<00:04:41.300> destroy

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
when the TNT goes off it will destroy

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.020 
when the TNT goes off it will destroy
these<00:04:41.870> blocks<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.470> only<00:04:43.460> these<00:04:43.640> blocks

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
these blocks and only these blocks

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.670 
these blocks and only these blocks

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.230 
giving you the XP and items so you just
build<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:48.950> around<00:04:49.070> like<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.910> can<00:04:50.090> put
