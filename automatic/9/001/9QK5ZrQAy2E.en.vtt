00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.210
 today we'll pack a bluetooth 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 speakers of a special kind 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.300
 namely the aerox calyx it of just what 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.070
 that part exactly that we can see each other 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 next week in review but today 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 Let's see what's in there 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 the packaging and how does it look like 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.029
 Actually, I really wish you out 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.750
 have fun 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 Let's go first there's a short 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.740
 look at the packaging on the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 front view the part times 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.450
 in the face right below the right 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 Manufacturer top left model and above 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.100
 right opportunities for all 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.559
 connect how turn it to the left 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.899
 and find the whole thing again 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.520
 This cord is included with 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.200
 tie it with it if it goes somewhere 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 can hang and the most important 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.539
 technical specifications and on the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 back we look what that us 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.980
 Part of the back so offers and because we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 do it again the same plane detail 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 we change quickly to the left and there 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 we see the left side 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.799
 cool is that the glasses again with 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.140
 a year on the temple is provided 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.040
 but as I said, look at us now 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 So we're going to make that part new to us 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.880
 So are four first cut above 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 seals pull the rope out 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.470
 take once again paper path and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.850
 Become a skull plus 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.350
 Product description is on the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.150
 back we find all the important 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 I tell you so now 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.729
 Let's put that aside 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.869
 just like the styrofoam it really is 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.869
 some supplies 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.000
 we start with the power supply like that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.550
 that's the power it brings and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 this is the corresponding connection here 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.940
 he currently does not see much 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.940
 we need a connection now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 and here is something by adapter 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.260
 supplied and also the one we 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 not need but then there is 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 Of course, still written to him that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:25.530
 just get started and then you can 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.850
 we the good skull so come on 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:39.810
 side because there is more to see 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:44.370
 Audio cable 3.5 to 35 mm cable micro 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.910
 USB and here we can use a USB cable 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.430
 put it in and what else do we have? 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.450
 small bend we can top 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.160
 grab the skull 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 I do not know yet whether I am 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.580
 Style would really dare to go somewhere 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.860
 to hang because the part already costs so 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 but it is definitely a bit 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.230
 So we accept that and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.680
 Now we come to the important part 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.590
 there the thing is still in a shell well 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:21.320
 packed but we do it naked 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.560
 rhymed always jut because now silva 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.070
 Let's have a look at the schnute 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.780
 so there he is now in his complete 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.970
 I would say chromed splendor 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.600
 look at the thing from all sides 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.040
 and then we go into detail 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.930
 the front looks quite 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.730
 cool i always have the problem i 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.910
 Dare not touch the frame 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.959
 otherwise the whole chrome is full with 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.140
 yes fingerprints so that now looks so 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.730
 out 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.200
 I can really see ne cool idea that 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.670
 Whole to pack in the skull 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.740
 probably rather something extravagant 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.720
 people pretty cool, I imagine that 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.680
 are any rocker shops before or 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.630
 is something as simple as in the room 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.720
 she thinks that pretty cool 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.570
 I like what we find here 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.209
 start with something totally fun one because 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.840
 down here what is blue in the tooth lights 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.180
 is the bluetooth led yes bluetooth means 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.640
 in german blue tooth and have here 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.250
 we have a blue led in a pay that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.810
 is super here in the front ten 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:37.390
 we find the louder and the unfortunately 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:40.120
 Taste and yes she does what she should 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.090
 then we find two speakers both 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.130
 Continue with 45 four and a half 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.260
 here and then we have one more upstairs 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.960
 another led that lights up, for example 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.300
 if that part of it loads one out 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 just press power button and then 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.340
 start the thing or press and then 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.169
 stops that on the backside 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.640
 We then have a new watt subwoofer 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.990
 and a few connections line out 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.880
 micro-usb here than we can because that 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.250
 update for example, perform on one 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.650
 new software power to the device too 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.320
 load and connect a line 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.470
 that was not so with all sides 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.419
 they also go up top 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.000
 is there the nfc detection area you 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.640
 of course it could be with bluetooth or 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.160
 via cable or via nfc pair and 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.110
 then play wirelessly as well 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.600
 here we still have this brain splitter and 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.330
 Now you can do the loop 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.390
 that's why it's really tight 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.710
 I always take a sweater in there 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.539
 Do not worry that there's something there 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.180
 broken gives her here because easy 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.400
 the loop in and then you can do that 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.039
 funny in your scout or for you 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.090
 grab schoolbags or whatever else 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.070
 still so 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.250
 otherwise easy to do and 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.900
 The thing sits bombproof Werner Bock 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.020
 has on this extravagant 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.000
 loudspeaker that is said there are round 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.449
 ten different colors cost the thing 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.389
 around 20 euros 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.809
 no 200 euro where the chrome 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.789
 version costs about 20 euros more 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.919
 a built-in microphone and the battery 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.050
 should last around ten hours 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.389
 I want to spoil a bit and 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.879
 say that the thing is really neat 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.860
 sound out point you should be real 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.360
 reviews 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.370
 I am surprised and you too 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.999
 be surprised what sharing really 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.710
 delivered 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.589
 well that was his so with this 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.830
 Thank you very much for your time 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.830
 It's good
