now if you were here for last year's
presentation<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.449> remember<00:00:03.810> me<00:00:03.959> comparing<00:00:04.380> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
presentation you remember me comparing a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.010 
presentation you remember me comparing a
baseball<00:00:05.130> player<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> softball<00:00:06.359> player<00:00:06.720> and

baseball player to a softball player and
their<00:00:07.140> swing<00:00:08.300> my<00:00:09.300> feeling<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.320> swing

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
their swing my feeling is that the swing

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.169 
their swing my feeling is that the swing
in<00:00:10.710> baseball<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> swing<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.670> softball

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
in baseball in the swing and softball

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.950 
in baseball in the swing and softball
are<00:00:12.420> very<00:00:13.019> similar<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:13.710> identical<00:00:14.960> minus

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
are very similar if not identical minus

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.580 
are very similar if not identical minus
the<00:00:16.320> slap<00:00:16.590> hitting<00:00:18.230> what<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> show

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the slap hitting what I'm going to show

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.340 
the slap hitting what I'm going to show
here<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:20.730> similar<00:00:21.119> swings<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.170> be

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
here is just how similar swings can be

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.220 
here is just how similar swings can be
in<00:00:22.590> baseball<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.130> softball<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> again<00:00:24.840> David

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
in baseball and softball so again David

Wright on the right and turiaf flowers

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.910 
Wright on the right and turiaf flowers
on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> left<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:29.330> we<00:00:30.330> start<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.650> both

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
on the left as we start we see they both

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.360 
on the left as we start we see they both
like<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> stride<00:00:33.360> forward<00:00:34.070> while<00:00:35.070> keeping

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
like to stride forward while keeping

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.709 
like to stride forward while keeping
their<00:00:35.550> weight<00:00:35.730> back<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> get

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
their weight back so we're going to get

their weight back so we're going to get
them<00:00:36.870> both<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.290> toe<00:00:37.469> touch<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
them both to toe touch right there and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.220 
them both to toe touch right there and
David<00:00:42.600> Wright<00:00:42.780> also<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> toe<00:00:43.530> touch<00:00:45.230> right

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
David Wright also to toe touch right

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.950 
David Wright also to toe touch right
there<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> drew<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> line<00:00:48.690> down<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
there so if I drew a line down the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.189 
there so if I drew a line down the
center<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> body<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.840> both

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
center of the body we can see on both

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.069 
center of the body we can see on both
athletes<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:54.149> most<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> weight<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
athletes that most of the weight is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
athletes that most of the weight is
still<00:00:55.289> back<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> key<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> being<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> good

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
still back the key to being a good

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
still back the key to being a good
hitter<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.890> key<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> being<00:00:59.190> able<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> hit

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
hitter and the key to being able to hit

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
hitter and the key to being able to hit
an<00:00:59.879> off-speed<00:01:00.329> pitch<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.469> create

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
an off-speed pitch as well as create

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
an off-speed pitch as well as create
power<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> fastball<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.840> able<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
power on a fastball is to be able to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
power on a fastball is to be able to
transfer<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> weight<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.369> our<00:01:05.519> back<00:01:05.760> hip<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
transfer the weight from our back hip to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
transfer the weight from our back hip to
our<00:01:06.630> front<00:01:06.869> hip<00:01:07.549> without<00:01:08.549> moving<00:01:08.850> those<00:01:08.970> hands

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
our front hip without moving those hands

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.020 
our front hip without moving those hands
forward<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.220> both<00:01:11.430> hitters<00:01:11.700> do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
forward as you will see both hitters do

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:32.860 
forward as you will see both hitters do
in<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:14.280> direction

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.110 

so<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:33.800> if<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:33.980> take<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.250> look<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.820> see<00:01:35.000> how

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
so now if we take a look we can see how

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.750 
so now if we take a look we can see how
far<00:01:35.390> they've<00:01:35.540> transferred<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.140> weight<00:01:36.760> but

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
far they've transferred that weight but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.740 
far they've transferred that weight but
we<00:01:37.880> can<00:01:38.030> also<00:01:38.210> see<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:40.160> hands<00:01:40.750> have

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
we can also see that the hands have

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.930 
we can also see that the hands have
remained<00:01:42.080> back<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:43.340> elbow<00:01:43.730> has

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
remained back and this elbow has

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.780 
remained back and this elbow has
remained<00:01:44.390> solid<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.160> they're<00:01:49.310> both<00:01:49.490> in

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
remained solid now that they're both in

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.880 
remained solid now that they're both in
their<00:01:50.120> balance<00:01:50.510> position<00:01:50.720> with<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.710> weight

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
their balance position with that weight

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.760 
their balance position with that weight
transferred<00:01:52.340> forward<00:01:53.290> they<00:01:54.290> can<00:01:54.500> release

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
transferred forward they can release

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:07.560 
transferred forward they can release
those<00:01:55.010> hands<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:56.510> attack<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.050> ball

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.540 

and<00:02:07.810> again<00:02:08.470> driving<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.250> back<00:02:09.520> leg<00:02:10.200> forward

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and again driving that back leg forward

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.090 
and again driving that back leg forward
through<00:02:12.550> contact
