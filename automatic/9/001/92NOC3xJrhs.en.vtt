store<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.780> little

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
store and I got one of these little

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770 
store and I got one of these little
storage<00:01:58.860> buckets<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.790> actually<00:02:00.450> cut<00:02:00.630> little

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
storage buckets and actually cut little

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
storage buckets and actually cut little
holes<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.250> sugar<00:02:02.460> gliders<00:02:02.909> could<00:02:03.119> go

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
holes in it so my sugar gliders could go

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.569
