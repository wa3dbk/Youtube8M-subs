lot of people gardening they will just

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.000 
lot of people gardening they will just
simply<00:00:21.359> throw<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.990> miracle<00:00:22.560> grow<00:00:22.769> on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
might want to think about what your

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
might want to think about what your
plants<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> their<00:00:31.170> living

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
creatures and they need a lot of the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.900 
creatures and they need a lot of the
same<00:00:33.329> things<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:34.140> need<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:35.370> example

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
same things you need for example

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.889 
same things you need for example
minerals<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> vitamins<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> trace<00:00:37.649> elements

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
minerals and vitamins and trace elements

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
minerals and vitamins and trace elements
you<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you see one of the things that a lot of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
you see one of the things that a lot of
people<00:00:41.670> forget<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> fields<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
people forget is that the fields and the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
people forget is that the fields and the
garden<00:00:45.239> areas<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.840> garden<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> same

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
garden areas if their garden in the same

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
garden areas if their garden in the same
spot<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.760> farmed<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> same<00:00:48.750> spot<00:00:48.960> year

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
spot or farmed in the same spot year

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
spot or farmed in the same spot year
after<00:00:49.410> year<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.579> takes<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:51.149> maybe<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.170> little

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
after year it takes only maybe as little

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
after year it takes only maybe as little
as<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> half<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.010> dozen<00:00:53.190> years<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> drain<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
as a half a dozen years to drain all the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.420 
as a half a dozen years to drain all the
minerals<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> vitamins<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.180> ground

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
minerals and vitamins out of that ground

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
minerals and vitamins out of that ground
now<00:00:59.430> true<00:00:59.850> they'll<00:01:00.149> put<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.989> farmers

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now true they'll put the farmers

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
now true they'll put the farmers
Republican<00:01:01.829> nitrogen<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.850> they'll<00:01:03.000> put<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
Republican nitrogen on or they'll put a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
Republican nitrogen on or they'll put a
little<00:01:03.390> phosphate<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.290> things<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
little phosphate on things like that and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.560 
little phosphate on things like that and
think<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:05.790> good<00:01:06.000> enough<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.390> they

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
think that's good enough because they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
think that's good enough because they
get<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> green<00:01:07.020> plant<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:07.619> close<00:01:07.890> they

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
get a green plant that's close they

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190 
get a green plant that's close they
don't<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
don't think they need more but that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.270 
don't think they need more but that
plant<00:01:10.710> becomes<00:01:11.670> deficient<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> problem

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
plant becomes deficient and the problem

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
plant becomes deficient and the problem
of<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.060> eat<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:16.320> no

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of it is when you eat that there's no

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.410 
of it is when you eat that there's no
minerals<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.159> vitamins<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> plant<00:01:18.150> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
minerals and vitamins in that plant so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
minerals and vitamins in that plant so
then<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> turn<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> got

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
then you got to turn around and you got

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
then you got to turn around and you got
to<00:01:20.189> buy<00:01:20.460> minerals<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.180> vitamins<00:01:21.299> for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to buy minerals and vitamins for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.130 
to buy minerals and vitamins for
yourself<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> catch<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.810> from

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
yourself and to try to catch up from

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039 
yourself and to try to catch up from
what<00:01:25.320> you've<00:01:25.560> overused<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.400> earth<00:01:27.049> but

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
what you've overused the earth but

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
what you've overused the earth but
rather<00:01:28.290> than<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> take<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> vitamins<00:01:29.520> for

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
rather than to take the vitamins for

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
rather than to take the vitamins for
yourself<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> bad<00:01:31.409> thing<00:01:31.439> as

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
yourself and that's not a bad thing as

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
yourself and that's not a bad thing as
far<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> goes<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:32.909> why<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.780> them<00:01:33.840> from

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
far as it goes but why not get them from

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
far as it goes but why not get them from
the<00:01:34.170> plants<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.100> nature<00:01:35.700> meant<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the plants like nature meant it to be

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440 
the plants like nature meant it to be
and<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> things<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.060> is
