on the far wall behind you is where we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
use solid with as much and we find it's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
use solid with as much and we find it's

it<00:05:39.629> it's<00:05:39.749> an<00:05:39.839> overarm<00:05:40.259> router<00:05:41.389> but<00:05:42.389> it's<00:05:42.629> just

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
it it's an overarm router but it's just

something<00:05:43.439> I<00:05:43.529> couldn't<00:05:43.770> give<00:05:44.009> up<00:05:44.039> and<00:05:44.490> then

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
something I couldn't give up and then

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.499 
something I couldn't give up and then
like<00:05:45.179> an<00:05:45.360> antique<00:05:46.229> vintage<00:05:46.529> scroll<00:05:47.429> saw<00:05:47.699> that

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
like an antique vintage scroll saw that

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.939

project<00:05:58.680> for<00:05:59.129> myself<00:05:59.520> or<00:05:59.729> for<00:05:59.789> life<00:06:00.539> is<00:06:00.839> very

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
project for myself or for life is very

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.350 
project for myself or for life is very
very<00:06:01.259> small<00:06:01.559> this<00:06:02.430> is<00:06:02.580> a<00:06:02.610> drill<00:06:02.879> press<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.240> we

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
very small this is a drill press that we

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.559 
very small this is a drill press that we
use<00:06:03.539> that<00:06:04.520> pretty<00:06:05.520> much<00:06:05.669> exclusively<00:06:05.939> for

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
use that pretty much exclusively for

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.230 
use that pretty much exclusively for
one-off<00:06:06.809> drilling<00:06:07.649> if<00:06:08.069> we<00:06:08.369> have<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:09.119> odd

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
one-off drilling if we have the odd

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.019 
one-off drilling if we have the odd
thing<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.479> do<00:06:09.749> sometimes<00:06:10.169> will<00:06:10.559> plant<00:06:10.889> a<00:06:11.519> piece

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
thing to do sometimes will plant a piece

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.850 
thing to do sometimes will plant a piece
of<00:06:12.059> angle<00:06:12.330> steel<00:06:12.659> as<00:06:12.930> a<00:06:12.959> fence<00:06:13.289> or<00:06:13.469> sometime

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
of angle steel as a fence or sometime

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.519 
of angle steel as a fence or sometime
kind<00:06:14.219> of<00:06:14.399> jig<00:06:14.809> but<00:06:15.809> generally<00:06:16.199> those<00:06:16.379> two

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
kind of jig but generally those two

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.899 
kind of jig but generally those two
drill<00:06:16.740> presses<00:06:16.919> get<00:06:17.189> the<00:06:17.279> most<00:06:17.429> use<00:06:17.729> because

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
drill presses get the most use because

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.079 
drill presses get the most use because
we<00:06:18.089> set<00:06:18.300> them<00:06:18.419> up<00:06:18.569> for<00:06:18.599> dedicated<00:06:19.849> usage<00:06:20.849> and

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.089 
we set them up for dedicated usage and

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.269 
we set them up for dedicated usage and
then<00:06:21.629> as<00:06:21.749> you<00:06:21.779> notice<00:06:22.199> you<00:06:22.319> know<00:06:22.409> a<00:06:22.439> planar<00:06:22.800> and

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
then as you notice you know a planar and

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.249 
then as you notice you know a planar and
then<00:06:23.789> dust<00:06:24.209> collection<00:06:24.539> throughout<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.050> shop

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
then dust collection throughout the shop

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.689 
then dust collection throughout the shop
which<00:06:25.499> I<00:06:25.619> would<00:06:25.740> say<00:06:25.889> is<00:06:25.949> probably<00:06:26.159> one<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.519> the

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
which I would say is probably one of the

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.159 
which I would say is probably one of the
things<00:06:26.909> that<00:06:26.999> increase<00:06:27.330> our<00:06:27.509> efficiency<00:06:27.599> the

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
things that increase our efficiency the

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.469 
things that increase our efficiency the
most<00:06:28.409> just<00:06:29.039> not<00:06:29.309> walking<00:06:29.639> from<00:06:30.089> machine<00:06:30.449> to

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
most just not walking from machine to

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.019 
most just not walking from machine to
machine<00:06:30.719> when<00:06:31.319> I<00:06:31.349> started<00:06:31.800> up<00:06:31.979> hooking<00:06:32.729> up

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
machine when I started up hooking up

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.209 
machine when I started up hooking up
hose<00:06:33.300> is<00:06:33.659> tripping<00:06:34.199> over<00:06:34.379> things<00:06:34.529> or<00:06:34.979> having

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
hose is tripping over things or having

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.949 
hose is tripping over things or having
to<00:06:35.249> do<00:06:35.399> just<00:06:35.610> one<00:06:35.729> small<00:06:35.969> operation<00:06:36.659> and<00:06:36.809> being

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:36.959 
to do just one small operation and being

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:38.569 
to do just one small operation and being
lazy<00:06:37.139> and<00:06:37.499> if<00:06:37.619> not<00:06:37.769> hooking<00:06:38.099> up<00:06:38.219> the<00:06:38.399> hose<00:06:38.550> and

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:38.579 
lazy and if not hooking up the hose and

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.969 
lazy and if not hooking up the hose and
then<00:06:38.789> having<00:06:39.059> to<00:06:39.089> clean<00:06:39.360> up<00:06:39.539> I<00:06:39.800> would<00:06:40.800> really

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
then having to clean up I would really

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:44.269 
then having to clean up I would really
recommend<00:06:41.189> to<00:06:41.639> anybody<00:06:41.849> to<00:06:42.300> set<00:06:42.539> up<00:06:42.689> a<00:06:43.279> very

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
recommend to anybody to set up a very

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.909 
recommend to anybody to set up a very
efficient<00:06:45.079> dust<00:06:46.079> collection<00:06:46.349> system<00:06:46.499> with

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
efficient dust collection system with

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.869 
efficient dust collection system with
blast<00:06:47.159> gates<00:06:47.369> to<00:06:47.669> keep<00:06:47.879> the<00:06:49.579> suction<00:06:50.579> at<00:06:50.729> its

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
blast gates to keep the suction at its

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:55.040 
blast gates to keep the suction at its
best<00:06:51.089> all<00:06:51.389> the<00:06:51.539> time<00:06:52.519> all<00:06:53.519> right<00:06:53.999> or<00:06:54.599> on<00:06:55.019> I

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
best all the time all right or on I

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.989 
best all the time all right or on I
think<00:06:55.319> that<00:06:55.680> sounds<00:06:56.189> like<00:06:56.249> a<00:06:56.399> pretty<00:06:56.879> good

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:56.999 
think that sounds like a pretty good

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.739 
think that sounds like a pretty good
overview<00:06:57.539> there<00:06:57.839> I<00:06:58.110> appreciate<00:06:58.889> it<00:06:58.919> and

00:06:59.739 --> 00:06:59.749 
overview there I appreciate it and

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.589 
overview there I appreciate it and
