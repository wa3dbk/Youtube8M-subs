00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.929 

um<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:08.280> do<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.700> some<00:03:09.530> customers<00:03:10.530> worried<00:03:11.519> that

um I do have some customers worried that

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.380 
um I do have some customers worried that
if<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.689> loose<00:03:13.230> wave<00:03:13.560> closure<00:03:14.250> cannot<00:03:14.970> just

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
if the loose wave closure cannot just

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.369 
if the loose wave closure cannot just
match<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.079> loose<00:03:16.579> bundles<00:03:17.579> they<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
match the loose bundles they have but I

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.930 
match the loose bundles they have but I
think<00:03:19.799> there<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.400> no<00:03:20.930> need<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.230> worry<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.790> can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
think there is no need to worry you can

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.390 
think there is no need to worry you can
just<00:03:24.329> see<00:03:25.220> they<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.430> also<00:03:26.640> mesh<00:03:28.220> very<00:03:29.220> well

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
just see they can also mesh very well

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
closure and just according to the size

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.530 
closure and just according to the size
and<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.629> curb<00:03:37.349> pattern<00:03:37.799> size<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.090> bundles

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.249 
lace base they just assumes like two
layers<00:05:33.349> can<00:05:33.800> you<00:05:34.129> see<00:05:34.339> that<00:05:34.519> just<00:05:35.360> for<00:05:35.659> forgive

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
layers can you see that just for forgive

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.619 
layers can you see that just for forgive
me<00:05:36.499> I<00:05:36.529> can<00:05:37.039> only<00:05:37.189> just<00:05:37.489> do<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:37.849> to<00:05:38.300> let<00:05:38.509> you

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
me I can only just do that to let you

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.040 
me I can only just do that to let you
see<00:05:38.869> clearly<00:05:39.469> and<00:05:39.769> this<00:05:40.459> is<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.909> just<00:05:41.449> made<00:05:41.719> by

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
see clearly and this is the just made by

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.089 
see clearly and this is the just made by
humans<00:05:42.729> so<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:44.239> will<00:05:44.479> be<00:05:44.509> more<00:05:44.989> expensive<00:05:45.319> than

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
humans so it will be more expensive than

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.049 
humans so it will be more expensive than
the<00:05:46.159> lake<00:05:47.029> space<00:05:47.499> maybe<00:05:48.499> can<00:05:49.069> you<00:05:49.189> if<00:05:49.399> compared

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.059 
the lake space maybe can you if compared

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.989 
the lake space maybe can you if compared
you<00:05:50.689> can<00:05:50.869> see<00:05:51.019> the<00:05:51.139> difference<00:05:51.529> this<00:05:52.459> is<00:05:52.669> the

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:52.999 
you can see the difference this is the

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:57.909 
you can see the difference this is the
front<00:05:53.659> one<00:05:53.989> and<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:55.639> the<00:05:55.759> top<00:05:56.649> also<00:05:57.649> blitz

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
front one and on the top also blitz

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.699 
front one and on the top also blitz
notes<00:05:58.309> also<00:05:58.669> collect<00:05:59.539> notes<00:05:59.899> well<00:06:00.499> this<00:06:00.679> is

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:00.709 
notes also collect notes well this is

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.299 
notes also collect notes well this is
silk<00:06:01.249> base<00:06:01.579> and<00:06:01.939> this<00:06:02.629> is<00:06:02.809> late<00:06:03.079> space<00:06:03.349> so<00:06:04.069> this

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:04.309 
silk base and this is late space so this

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.939 
silk base and this is late space so this
is<00:06:04.339> a<00:06:04.489> difference<00:06:04.999> and<00:06:05.239> we<00:06:05.300> have<00:06:06.199> the<00:06:06.409> link<00:06:06.649> of

is a difference and we have the link of

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.299 
is a difference and we have the link of
the<00:06:07.189> late<00:06:07.429> self<00:06:07.759> base<00:06:08.199> as<00:06:09.199> well<00:06:09.469> if<00:06:10.069> you<00:06:10.279> want
