00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.420 
see my hair is darker but you know what
actually<00:06:21.120> I<00:06:21.389> really<00:06:21.839> like<00:06:22.080> it<00:06:22.349> showing<00:06:23.310> a

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
actually I really like it showing a

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.659 
actually I really like it showing a
little<00:06:23.550> darkness<00:06:24.029> going<00:06:24.569> into<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:25.520> darker<00:06:26.520> I

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
little darkness going into the darker I

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.369 
little darkness going into the darker I
mean<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:26.879> lighter<00:06:27.089> color<00:06:27.389> and<00:06:27.719> I<00:06:28.050> think<00:06:28.259> it

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:28.379 
mean the lighter color and I think it

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.110 
mean the lighter color and I think it
really<00:06:28.529> works<00:06:28.650> out<00:06:28.979> really<00:06:29.580> well<00:06:29.729> and

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
really works out really well and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.429 
really works out really well and
sometimes<00:06:30.419> what<00:06:30.839> you<00:06:30.870> can<00:06:31.229> do<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.800> let<00:06:32.520> me
