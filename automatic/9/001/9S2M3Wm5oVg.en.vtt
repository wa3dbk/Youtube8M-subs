be able to demonstrate in the class as a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440 
be able to demonstrate in the class as a
prep<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.429> everyone's<00:00:14.849> facing<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> same

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
prep by everyone's facing the same

prep by everyone's facing the same
direction<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:16.020> rows<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> our<00:00:16.710> group

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
direction in rows this is our group

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.950 
direction in rows this is our group
intro<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.789> we're<00:00:17.940> introducing<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.750> will

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
intro now we're introducing how we will

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
intro now we're introducing how we will
be<00:00:19.080> able<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.560> opponent<00:00:19.800> actually

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
be able to have an opponent actually

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
be able to have an opponent actually
having<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> partner<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> partner<00:00:21.960> B

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
having it partner a and a partner B

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
having it partner a and a partner B
usually<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> partner<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:23.880> one

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
usually the partner a is the first one

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.980 
usually the partner a is the first one
that's<00:00:24.180> attacking<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that's attacking and you have a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's attacking and you have a
reference<00:00:25.170> point<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.099> partner<00:00:26.369> B<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
reference point and the partner B is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.890 
reference point and the partner B is
doing<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:27.060> sort<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> defense<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
doing some sort of the defense or the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990

counter<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
counter so what I like to do in the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.609 
counter so what I like to do in the
class<00:00:30.210> when<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> first<00:00:30.689> demonstrate<00:00:31.289> before<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
class when I first demonstrate before I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.930 
class when I first demonstrate before I
have<00:00:31.769> any<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> people<00:00:32.430> hitting<00:00:32.820> each

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

avoiding any accidents is I try and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.180 
avoiding any accidents is I try and
demonstrate<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.620> front<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
first partner will throw the jab and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
first partner will throw the jab and
he's<00:00:39.750> gonna<00:00:39.870> hold<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> position<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.070> first

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
he's gonna hold a position out so first

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
he's gonna hold a position out so first
person's<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> jab<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.050> jab<00:00:43.260> comes

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
person's going to jab as that jab comes

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.310 
person's going to jab as that jab comes
out<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> aim<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.320> knuckles

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out I don't want to aim for the knuckles

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.869 
out I don't want to aim for the knuckles
or<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> fingers<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.100> actually<00:00:47.280> tell<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
or the fingers I actually tell them that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
or the fingers I actually tell them that
I<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> parry<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> deflection

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I want to parry and it's a deflection

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.310 
I want to parry and it's a deflection
across<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.879> aiming<00:00:51.270> towards<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> wrist

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
across it's aiming towards the wrist

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.720 
across it's aiming towards the wrist
watch<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.100> especially<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.579> teaching

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
watch so especially if you're teaching

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.100 
watch so especially if you're teaching
kids<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.120> could<00:00:54.239> always<00:00:54.329> tell<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
kids you could always tell them what to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
kids you could always tell them what to
be<00:00:55.199> able<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> block<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.860> their<00:00:56.039> wrist

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
be able to block with their wrist

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.790 
be able to block with their wrist
watches<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.480> basically<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> one-handed

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
watches and basically it's a one-handed

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.139 
watches and basically it's a one-handed
clap<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.760> their<00:00:59.879> clap

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
clap so if they actually do their clap

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
clap so if they actually do their clap
and<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> one-hand<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.530> never<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and it's a one-hand it is never going to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.260 
and it's a one-hand it is never going to
be<00:01:02.129> pushing<00:01:02.430> forward<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> should<00:01:03.149> never

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
be pushing forward so you should never

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
be pushing forward so you should never
mistake<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> catch<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.460> does

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
mistake this as a catch so if he does

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
mistake this as a catch so if he does
this<00:01:05.729> again<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.240> throws<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> jab<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this again and he throws the jab the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
this again and he throws the jab the
jabs<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.130> come<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> I'm<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
jabs gonna come out and I'm gonna just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
jabs gonna come out and I'm gonna just
deflect<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> side<00:01:09.960> again<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
deflect it out to the side again if I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880 
deflect it out to the side again if I
push<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.010> too<00:01:11.280> far<00:01:11.900> that's<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> mess<00:01:13.740> up

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
push it too far that's going to mess up

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
push it too far that's going to mess up
our<00:01:14.010> timing<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> also<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.150> bad<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.509> my

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
our timing and also it's bad for my

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.850 
our timing and also it's bad for my
counter<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.020> defense<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.560> any<00:01:16.710> other

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
counter and defense or any other

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
counter and defense or any other
techniques<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.580> might<00:01:17.670> come<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
techniques that might come out so this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.700 
techniques that might come out so this
time<00:01:18.900> he's<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.320> make<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
time he's gonna actually make it a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
time he's gonna actually make it a
little<00:01:19.740> bit<00:01:20.009> harder<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> jab<00:01:21.090> followed<00:01:21.600> by

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
little bit harder with a jab followed by

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
little bit harder with a jab followed by
the<00:01:21.780> cross<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.740> he's<00:01:23.040> doing<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> noticing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the cross as he's doing that noticing

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.249 
the cross as he's doing that noticing
that<00:01:24.210> I've<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.540> created<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.140> bit

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that I've actually created a little bit

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
that I've actually created a little bit
of<00:01:25.409> distance<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.130> he<00:01:26.310> resets<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.820> notice<00:01:27.630> my

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
of distance if he resets back notice my
