00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bow but it's definitely not a weapon

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
bashes but that's just the nature of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
bashes but that's just the nature of
playing<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.950> loadout<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.090> me<00:01:15.119> using

up<00:01:17.340> close<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> single-shot<00:01:18.479> weapon<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
up close it's a single-shot weapon that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
up close it's a single-shot weapon that
does<00:01:19.290> take<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> draw<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> are

a<00:02:44.670> video<00:02:44.820> game<00:02:45.270> good<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.900> popular<00:02:46.560> what

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
a video game good you know popular what

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.100 
a video game good you know popular what
makes<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.120> people<00:02:48.270> want<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.960> play

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
makes it so that people want to play

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.600 
makes it so that people want to play
this<00:02:49.260> game<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.920> over<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.190> over<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.460> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
this game over and over and over and I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.220 
this game over and over and over and I
think<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.030> developers<00:02:51.660> are<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
think that developers are really at a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.810 
think that developers are really at a
crossroads<00:02:52.320> at<00:02:52.980> times<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.640> don't

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
crossroads at times because they don't

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.460 
crossroads at times because they don't
want<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.060> make<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.240> game<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.720> completely<00:02:55.140> just

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
want to make a game that completely just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
want to make a game that completely just
caters<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.010> everyone<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> lot<00:02:57.690> of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
caters to everyone you know as a lot of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.270 
caters to everyone you know as a lot of
you<00:02:57.990> know<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.350> good<00:02:58.620> players<00:02:58.860> would<00:02:59.070> call

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
you know really good players would call

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
you know really good players would call
it<00:02:59.430> catering<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.330> noobs<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.930> always<00:03:01.260> really

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it catering to noobs and I always really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.970 
it catering to noobs and I always really
hated<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.190> because<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.760> seems<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.270> people

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
hated that because it seems like people

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.380 
hated that because it seems like people
kind<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.040> forget<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.490> roots<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.850> video<00:03:06.090> games

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
kind of forget the roots of video games

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.570 
kind of forget the roots of video games
being<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.960> pastime<00:03:07.740> something<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.460> would

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
being a pastime something that you would

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.470 
being a pastime something that you would
you<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.850> hang<00:03:09.030> out<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.300> your<00:03:09.450> friends

you know hang out with your friends

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.830 
you know hang out with your friends
you'd<00:03:10.290> play<00:03:10.470> some<00:03:10.710> video<00:03:10.980> games<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:12.120> wouldn't

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
you'd play some video games you wouldn't

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.330 
you'd play some video games you wouldn't
really<00:03:12.960> care<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.500> who's<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.860> best<00:03:14.070> long

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
really care you know who's the best long

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.950 
really care you know who's the best long
as<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:14.550> had<00:03:14.730> fun<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:15.810> what

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
as you had fun I think that's what

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.479 
as you had fun I think that's what
developers<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.830> need<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.010> strive<00:03:17.459> for

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
developers kind of need to strive for

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.190 
developers kind of need to strive for
now<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> think<00:03:18.300> that's<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.600> crisis<00:03:19.020> does

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
now and I think that's what crisis does

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.140 
now and I think that's what crisis does
well<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.640> really<00:03:20.970> good<00:03:21.120> at

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
well it's like if you're really good at

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.520 
well it's like if you're really good at
crisis<00:03:21.630> three<00:03:21.840> are<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.440> get

crisis three are you going to get

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.160 
crisis three are you going to get
rewarded<00:03:23.070> yes<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.750> know<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> can't

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
rewarded yes and that you know I can't

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.199 
rewarded yes and that you know I can't
emphasize<00:03:25.290> yes<00:03:25.860> enough<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:26.850> you're<00:03:26.970> bad

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
important I think a lot of people

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860 
important I think a lot of people
overlook<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:33.270> did<00:03:33.420> bad<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.840> first

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
overlook that they did bad in the first

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.660 
overlook that they did bad in the first
couple<00:03:34.200> rounds<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.920> maybe<00:03:35.100> didn't<00:03:35.370> try<00:03:35.550> out

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
couple rounds and maybe didn't try out

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 
couple rounds and maybe didn't try out
some<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> fun<00:03:36.209> modes<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.660> are<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:36.959> crysis

but Crytek took the opposite route you
know<00:04:20.640> they<00:04:20.850> actually<00:04:21.210> listen<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.630> people<00:04:21.960> from

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
the get-go and that's awesome I think

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.400 
the get-go and that's awesome I think
that's<00:04:24.270> something<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.870> really

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410

game in its entirety because some of the

game in its entirety because some of the
last<00:05:17.040> levels<00:05:17.520> are<00:05:17.640> super<00:05:17.850> super<00:05:18.180> hard<00:05:18.540> however

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960

was<00:05:19.500> there<00:05:19.680> enough<00:05:19.950> in<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.190> early<00:05:20.490> levels<00:05:20.820> to

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
was there enough in the early levels to

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.940 
was there enough in the early levels to
keep<00:05:21.150> casual<00:05:21.660> players<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:22.380> continuing<00:05:22.920> to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
keep casual players to continuing to

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.610 
keep casual players to continuing to
play<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.370> yes<00:05:23.700> because<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.300> was<00:05:24.450> fun<00:05:24.780> yet<00:05:25.470> it

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
play it yes because it was fun yet it

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.620 
play it yes because it was fun yet it
didn't<00:05:25.980> punish<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.520> ton<00:05:26.790> so<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:27.090> think<00:05:27.210> Mario

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
didn't punish you a ton so I think Mario

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.240 
didn't punish you a ton so I think Mario
is<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.780> good<00:05:27.930> example<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.470> know<00:05:28.530> it's<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.920> very<00:05:29.160> old

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
is a good example I know it's a very old

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.820
