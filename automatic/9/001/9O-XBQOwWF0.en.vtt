00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
also made a few changes in the color by

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.470 
also made a few changes in the color by
knocking<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> black<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> slate<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
knocking out the black and slate and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360 
knocking out the black and slate and
replacing<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.290> space<00:00:34.770> grey<00:00:35.070> color

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
replacing it with a space grey color

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.799 
replacing it with a space grey color
which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.000> little<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.300> lighter<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
which is just a little bit lighter and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.330 
which is just a little bit lighter and
in<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.110> opinion<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.950> does<00:00:38.129> look

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in my opinion it actually does look

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
in my opinion it actually does look
pretty<00:00:38.489> good<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.940> first<00:00:39.180> looks<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> they've

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pretty good from first looks and they've

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
pretty good from first looks and they've
also<00:00:40.379> added<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.309> gold<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> champagne

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
also added in and gold and champagne

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.900 
also added in and gold and champagne
color<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.469> from<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.129> days<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.640> seems

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
color but from the first days it seems

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
color but from the first days it seems
like<00:00:45.120> everywhere<00:00:45.570> had<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:46.140> limited<00:00:46.410> stock

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
like everywhere had very limited stock

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
like everywhere had very limited stock
of<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.940> let's<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.210> waste<00:00:48.390> any<00:00:48.600> time

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of that so let's not waste any time

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
of that so let's not waste any time
let's<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.710> unboxing<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
let's get right into the unboxing the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.069 
let's get right into the unboxing the
overall<00:00:50.820> experience<00:00:51.420> remains<00:00:51.690> pretty<00:00:51.989> much

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
but a guess is better than nothing and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
but a guess is better than nothing and
of<00:01:29.610> course<00:01:29.850> you've<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.659> USB<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
stuff here's the iPhone 5s itself in the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
stuff here's the iPhone 5s itself in the
space<00:01:43.619> gray<00:01:43.890> color<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.520> actually<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> much

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
space gray color I actually like it much

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
space gray color I actually like it much
more<00:01:45.840> than<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.079> thought<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
more than I thought it would I kind of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.560 
more than I thought it would I kind of
liked<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> fact<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.450> bit

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
liked the fact that it is a little bit

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.499 
liked the fact that it is a little bit
lighter<00:01:48.810> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.500> gunmetal<00:01:49.920> grey<00:01:50.509> as

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
lighter kind of a gunmetal grey as

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
lighter kind of a gunmetal grey as
opposed<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> slate<00:01:52.380> color<00:01:52.619> which<00:01:52.860> did

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
opposed to the slate color which did

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
opposed to the slate color which did
have<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.399> tripping<00:01:54.030> issues<00:01:54.390> which<00:01:54.570> could<00:01:54.780> be

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
have some tripping issues which could be

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
have some tripping issues which could be
why<00:01:55.110> Apple<00:01:55.590> killed<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
why Apple killed it but you can see the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
why Apple killed it but you can see the
front<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.990> general<00:01:58.409> looks<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:58.829> much<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
front in general looks pretty much the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.679 
front in general looks pretty much the
same<00:01:59.280> except<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> home<00:02:00.119> button<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> does

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
same except for the home button it does

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
same except for the home button it does
have<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> nice<00:02:01.079> ring<00:02:01.259> around<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.310> actually

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
have a nice ring around it that actually

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
have a nice ring around it that actually
activates<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.570> touch<00:02:03.899> ID<00:02:04.170> sensor<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
activates the touch ID sensor the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
activates the touch ID sensor the
fingerprint<00:02:05.340> sensor<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.790> course<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.719> will

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
fingerprint sensor of course that will

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.450 
fingerprint sensor of course that will
be<00:02:06.869> covered<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> separate<00:02:07.829> video

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
be covered in a separate video

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.370 
be covered in a separate video
but<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:08.970> general<00:02:09.120> the<00:02:09.360> phone<00:02:09.540> itself<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.110> still

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
but in general the phone itself is still

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.440 
but in general the phone itself is still
very<00:02:10.650> elegant-looking<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.850> you'd<00:02:12.030> expect
