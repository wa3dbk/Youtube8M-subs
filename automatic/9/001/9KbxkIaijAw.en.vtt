00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.470
 suddenly especially for motorists like 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 drive summer tires 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.980
 I would like to draw the attention of drivers 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 for the period when it falls a lot 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 tires be sure to replace it yet 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.219
 copious amounts of snow did not fall well and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 the most important thing is not to exceed 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 speed and indeed in this weather 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 better ride on the sly 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 little car still needed 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 carefully and carefully driving in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 turns right here the drivers don't 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
 calculate the speed and do not take into account 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.750
 condition of the road and as a result departure 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.010
 on the oncoming lane and crash 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 non-observance of the distance especially on 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.930
 slippery road is frequent 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 period occurred 27 accidents decrease 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.509
