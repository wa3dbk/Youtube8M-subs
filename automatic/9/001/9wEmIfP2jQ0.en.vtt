product strategy for rogue wave software

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.320 
product strategy for rogue wave software
so<00:00:25.650> we're<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.340> talking<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.699> multi-core

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so we're here talking about multi-core

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.500 
so we're here talking about multi-core
processors<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.849> taking<00:00:29.849> advantage<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.330> them

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
processors and taking advantage of them

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
processors and taking advantage of them
what<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> top<00:00:31.529> things<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.130> would

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
what are the top things that you would

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.650 
what are the top things that you would
recommend<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.910> customers<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.570> are

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
recommend to customers that are

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.000 
recommend to customers that are
interested<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> taking<00:00:34.260> advantage<00:00:34.710> multi

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
interested in taking advantage multi

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
interested in taking advantage multi
core<00:00:35.190> sure<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.530> big<00:00:37.680> topic

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
core sure it's it's a it's a big topic

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.260 
core sure it's it's a it's a big topic
now<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> lot<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:38.820> talking<00:00:38.850> about

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
now a lot of people are talking about

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
now a lot of people are talking about
with<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.290> new<00:00:40.379> hardware<00:00:40.710> coming<00:00:41.040> out

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with all the new hardware coming out

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
with all the new hardware coming out
it's<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.210> software<00:00:42.480> developers

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's something that software developers

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's something that software developers
have<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> think<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.800> than<00:00:44.160> they

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
have to think a lot more about than they

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180 
have to think a lot more about than they
have<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> past<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.690> guess<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.950> first

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
have in the past and I guess I the first

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
have in the past and I guess I the first
thing<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.430> would<00:00:47.489> recommend<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> really

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
thing I would recommend is to really

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.700 
thing I would recommend is to really
think<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.399> what's<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> nature<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
think about what's the nature of the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.569 
think about what's the nature of the
parallelism<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.219> trying<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
parallelism that you're trying to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
parallelism that you're trying to
achieve<00:00:53.690> there<00:00:54.690> are<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:54.870> levels<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
achieve there are different levels of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
achieve there are different levels of
granularity<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.969> solutions<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
granularity and different solutions that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.260 
granularity and different solutions that
go<00:00:57.750> along<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.320> those<00:00:58.590> different<00:00:58.920> approaches

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
go along with those different approaches

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
go along with those different approaches
so<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.449> example<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.190> you're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so for example if you're if you're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
so for example if you're if you're
looking<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.670> something<00:01:02.850> very<00:01:03.210> lower<00:01:03.899> level

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
looking at something very lower level

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.770 
looking at something very lower level
like<00:01:04.500> making<00:01:04.890> mechana<00:01:05.369> loop<00:01:05.549> parallel<00:01:05.970> there

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
like making mechana loop parallel there

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
like making mechana loop parallel there
are<00:01:06.840> things<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.049> compilers<00:01:07.650> offer<00:01:08.310> there

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
are things that compilers offer there

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
are things that compilers offer there
there<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.360> libraries<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.320> help<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
there are libraries that can help you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
there are libraries that can help you
out<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.790> larger<00:01:12.180> components

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
out a lot if you have larger components

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.679 
out a lot if you have larger components
like<00:01:12.900> services<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.580> also<00:01:14.689> frameworks

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
like services there are also frameworks

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.210 
like services there are also frameworks
and<00:01:15.810> run<00:01:15.960> times<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.009> make

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and run times that can that can make

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.350 
and run times that can that can make
that<00:01:17.400> much<00:01:17.610> easier<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> make<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that much easier and make the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
that much easier and make the
manageability<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.840> maintainability<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
manageability and maintainability of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
manageability and maintainability of
those<00:01:20.520> things<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.090> user<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.799> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
those things a lot of user as well so

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.230 
those things a lot of user as well so
it's<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.220> important<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:23.970> think

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it's really important to really think

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's really important to really think
through<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> trying<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> achieve

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
through what are you trying to achieve

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
through what are you trying to achieve
is<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> new<00:01:26.759> application<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.869> being

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is this a new application that's being

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.859 
is this a new application that's being
built<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.890> repurposing<00:01:29.700> existing<00:01:30.630> code

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
built or in repurposing existing code

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.100 
built or in repurposing existing code
and<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.950> those<00:01:32.130> things<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.900> help

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and all those things will will help

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
and all those things will will help
guide<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.590> toward<00:01:34.920> toward<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> right

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
guide you toward toward the right

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.330 
guide you toward toward the right
solution

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
solution

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.270 
solution
great<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.539> think<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:39.109> know<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:39.469> talked<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
great and I think you know we talked a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.569 
great and I think you know we talked a
lot<00:01:40.399> about<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.000> panel<00:01:41.329> about<00:01:42.369> whether<00:01:43.369> you

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
lot about in the panel about whether you

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.240 
lot about in the panel about whether you
know<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> ideal<00:01:44.270> thing<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.899> design<00:01:45.079> in<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
know the ideal thing is to design in the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.069 
know the ideal thing is to design in the
multi<00:01:47.109> threading<00:01:48.109> capability<00:01:49.069> into<00:01:49.340> your

multi threading capability into your

multi threading capability into your
overall<00:01:51.079> program<00:01:51.979> algorithm<00:01:52.579> but<00:01:52.819> if<00:01:53.090> you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
overall program algorithm but if you

overall program algorithm but if you
can't<00:01:53.600> do<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.869> if<00:01:54.020> you're<00:01:54.110> taking<00:01:54.229> old<00:01:54.560> code

can't do that if you're taking old code

can't do that if you're taking old code
that<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.130> need<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.399> migrate<00:01:55.549> you<00:01:55.880> know

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
these new cores on dye know what would

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.800 
these new cores on dye know what would
you<00:02:03.439> recommend<00:02:03.560> for<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.340> right<00:02:04.759> right<00:02:05.209> yeah

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you recommend for that right right yeah

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.599 
you recommend for that right right yeah
it'd<00:02:05.959> be<00:02:05.990> nice<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:06.289> we<00:02:06.500> could<00:02:06.649> if<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.399> could

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
it'd be nice if we could if we could

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.609 
it'd be nice if we could if we could
just<00:02:07.640> start<00:02:08.569> over<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.019> rewrite<00:02:09.349> things

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
just start over and rewrite things

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.530 
just start over and rewrite things
that'd<00:02:09.860> be<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> lot<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.220> fun<00:02:10.429> but<00:02:10.640> most<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
that'd be a lot of fun but most of the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.059 
that'd be a lot of fun but most of the
time<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:12.230> hit<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.650> existing

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
time we hit we have existing

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
time we hit we have existing
applications<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.329> to<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
applications and you have to you have to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.800 
applications and you have to you have to
make<00:02:15.079> those<00:02:15.260> work<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.769> bring<00:02:16.280> those<00:02:16.400> forward

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
make those work and bring those forward

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.319 
make those work and bring those forward
and<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:19.099> kind<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.579> same<00:02:19.760> thing<00:02:19.819> I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
and and really kind of the same thing I

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.880 
and and really kind of the same thing I
think<00:02:20.599> it's<00:02:21.079> really<00:02:21.260> important<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.650> look<00:02:21.799> at

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
think it's really important to look at

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.259 
think it's really important to look at
the<00:02:22.010> architecture<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.610> your<00:02:22.849> existing

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
the architecture of your existing

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.160 
the architecture of your existing
application<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:25.090> total<00:02:26.090> not<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.959> at<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
application in total not just at the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.009 
application in total not just at the
parallelism<00:02:28.060> again<00:02:29.060> one<00:02:29.629> of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> approaches

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
parallelism again one of the approaches

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.440 
parallelism again one of the approaches
that<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.680> really<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.549> for<00:02:31.879> larger

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
that we really like for for larger

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.050 
that we really like for for larger
applications<00:02:33.079> especially<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.790> look

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
applications especially is to is to look

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.600 
applications especially is to is to look
at<00:02:35.269> those<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.440> broken<00:02:36.739> into<00:02:36.980> components

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
at those can be broken into components

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.479 
at those can be broken into components
or<00:02:37.700> services<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:39.440> then<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.340> can

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
or services then then you can you can

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.670 
or services then then you can you can
run<00:02:40.670> those<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.209> parallel<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.989> take<00:02:42.530> advantage

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
run those in parallel and take advantage

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.069 
run those in parallel and take advantage

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
same question that we asked Patrick

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.640 
same question that we asked Patrick
which<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.690> what's<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.140> number<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.500> thing

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
which is what's the number one thing

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.020 
which is what's the number one thing
developers<00:03:24.280> should<00:03:24.310> do<00:03:24.520> when<00:03:24.670> looking<00:03:24.880> at

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
developers should do when looking at

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.720 
developers should do when looking at
that's<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.080> core<00:03:26.260> adoption<00:03:26.650> well<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.310> think<00:03:27.430> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
that's a core adoption well I think the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.520 
that's a core adoption well I think the
big<00:03:28.120> challenge<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.660> everybody<00:03:29.020> is<00:03:29.140> facing

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
big challenge that everybody is facing

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.410 
big challenge that everybody is facing
today<00:03:29.800> is<00:03:29.980> multi<00:03:30.310> core<00:03:30.520> technology<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.300> its

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
today is multi core technology in its

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.020 
today is multi core technology in its
own<00:03:32.050> right<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.890> challenge<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.490> number<00:03:33.790> one

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
own right the challenge is number one

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.240 
own right the challenge is number one
we're<00:03:34.600> getting<00:03:34.870> more<00:03:35.020> more<00:03:35.290> cores<00:03:35.620> available

develop in parallel and threaded
environments<00:03:52.570> easily<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:53.710> what<00:03:53.890> we've<00:03:54.010> done

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.550 
environments easily so what we've done
is<00:03:54.370> we've<00:03:54.550> focused<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:55.240> scalability<00:03:55.750> which

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
is we've focused on scalability which

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.290 
is we've focused on scalability which
makes<00:03:56.830> things<00:03:57.280> being<00:03:57.490> able<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.730> scale<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.000> very

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
makes things being able to scale to very

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.510 
makes things being able to scale to very
very<00:03:58.570> large<00:03:58.780> numbers<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.230> processes<00:03:59.980> that

very large numbers of processes that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.040 
very large numbers of processes that

fits the high-performance computing

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.930 
fits the high-performance computing
market<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.220> bid<00:04:03.400> market<00:04:03.820> which

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
market and you have the bid market which

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.610 
market and you have the bid market which
is<00:04:03.970> probably<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.540> where<00:04:05.260> most<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> the

industrial work is done and then of
course<00:04:07.420> we<00:04:07.840> focus<00:04:08.230> as<00:04:08.410> well<00:04:08.440> on<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.890> small

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
course we focus as well on the small

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.830 
course we focus as well on the small
markets<00:04:09.700> which<00:04:09.880> are<00:04:10.090> people<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.780> are

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
markets which are people that are

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.390 
markets which are people that are
developing<00:04:11.440> applications<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:12.310> were

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
developing applications that were

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.970 
developing applications that were
particularly<00:04:12.850> scalar<00:04:13.420> now<00:04:14.320> they<00:04:14.500> need<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.830> be

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
particularly scalar now they need to be

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.229 
particularly scalar now they need to be
able<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.220> take<00:04:15.370> advantage<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.760> multi-core

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.270 
able to take advantage of multi-core
which<00:04:16.510> means<00:04:16.720> i<00:04:16.810> need<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.380> paralyze<00:04:17.980> these

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
which means i need to paralyze these

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.880

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
were originally able or that are focused

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.610 
were originally able or that are focused
on<00:04:51.970> being<00:04:52.150> able<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.540> do<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.840> development<00:04:53.530> of

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
on being able to do the development of

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.310 
on being able to do the development of
the<00:04:54.000> application<00:04:55.000> prior<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.720> compiling

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
the application prior to the compiling

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.470 
the application prior to the compiling
which<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.860> requires<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.460> debugging<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.360> we

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
which that requires it debugging so we

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.150 
which that requires it debugging so we
fit<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> little<00:04:58.990> bit<00:04:59.080> further<00:04:59.320> down<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.800> stream

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
fit a little bit further down the stream

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.490 
fit a little bit further down the stream
but<00:05:00.760> very<00:05:01.030> very<00:05:01.270> critical<00:05:01.540> as<00:05:01.930> people<00:05:02.230> start

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
but very very critical as people start

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.380 
but very very critical as people start
moving<00:05:02.860> into<00:05:03.100> really<00:05:03.400> taking<00:05:03.760> advantage<00:05:03.850> of

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
moving into really taking advantage of

moving into really taking advantage of
multi-core<00:05:04.930> technologies<00:05:06.000> that's<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.090> great

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
multi-core technologies that's a great

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.150 
multi-core technologies that's a great
point<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.660> mean<00:05:07.810> as<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.230> lot<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.710> times<00:05:08.860> we<00:05:08.980> talked

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
point I mean as a lot of times we talked

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.530 
point I mean as a lot of times we talked
about<00:05:09.340> getting<00:05:09.460> started<00:05:10.090> on<00:05:10.180> multi-core

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
about getting started on multi-core

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.980 
about getting started on multi-core
adoption<00:05:11.170> but<00:05:11.350> not<00:05:11.920> often<00:05:12.250> doing

end up talking about what do you do once
you<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:15.030> multi-car<00:05:15.510> there's<00:05:15.750> obviously

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
you have multi-car there's obviously

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.140 
you have multi-car there's obviously
going<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.320> be<00:05:16.440> but<00:05:16.710> debugging<00:05:17.430> process<00:05:17.550> and

those<00:05:58.140> are<00:05:58.170> really<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.590> ways<00:05:58.830> we're<00:05:58.980> going<00:05:59.100> to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
those are really the ways we're going to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.400 
those are really the ways we're going to
take<00:05:59.370> advantage<00:05:59.640> of<00:05:59.880> technology<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:00.780> that's

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
take advantage of technology and that's

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.940 
take advantage of technology and that's
the<00:06:01.590> big<00:06:01.770> challenge<00:06:02.010> because<00:06:02.460> now<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:03.950> as

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
the big challenge because now the as

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.560 
the big challenge because now the as
much<00:06:05.190> as<00:06:05.340> we're<00:06:05.490> very<00:06:05.700> pleased<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.270> have<00:06:06.300> all

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
much as we're very pleased to have all

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.260 
much as we're very pleased to have all
this<00:06:06.720> hardware<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.920> this<00:06:08.130> capability<00:06:08.340> we've

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
this hardware and this capability we've

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.060 
this hardware and this capability we've
really<00:06:09.600> thrown<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.020> problem<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.500> how<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.710> use

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
really thrown the problem of how to use

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.250 
really thrown the problem of how to use
that<00:06:11.310> hardware<00:06:11.760> or<00:06:12.300> don't<00:06:12.540> use<00:06:12.720> those<00:06:12.900> chips

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
that hardware or don't use those chips

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.470 
that hardware or don't use those chips
