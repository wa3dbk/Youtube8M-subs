I've<00:01:11.560> done<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.830> I've<00:01:12.130> rigged<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.610> flash<00:01:12.880> up<00:01:13.090> here

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
I've done is I've rigged a flash up here

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.820 
I've done is I've rigged a flash up here
and<00:01:13.540> we're<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:13.930> use<00:01:14.230> that<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.620> shoot

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
and we're going to use that to shoot

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.470 
and we're going to use that to shoot
some<00:01:15.040> wide<00:01:15.250> shots<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.670> I'm<00:01:15.970> going<00:01:16.120> to<00:01:16.150> pretend

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
to become crashing through here so we

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.130 
to become crashing through here so we
get<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.439> bright<00:01:20.829> vibrant<00:01:21.520> wide<00:01:22.420> shot<00:01:22.780> that

goes<00:01:23.290> nicely<00:01:23.650> with<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.070> close-ups<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
goes nicely with the close-ups that

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.429 
goes nicely with the close-ups that

to part that up up there that's going to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.859 
to part that up up there that's going to
be<00:01:48.640> our<00:01:48.759> Sun<00:01:48.969> light<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.210> again<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.780> about

sort of full power
just<00:01:54.790> take<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.799> okay<00:01:56.799> we're<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.009> power

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
just take that up okay we're on power

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.929 
just take that up okay we're on power
six<00:01:57.700> that's<00:01:58.090> fine<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:59.770> got<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.310> transmitter
