really bumps up the camera and the fact

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.350 
really bumps up the camera and the fact
that<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.410> camera<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.890> still<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.670> small<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
that this camera is still so small and

waterproof it's it's it's a huge
breakthrough<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.200> design<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.920> that's<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.520> me

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
breakthrough in design and that's to me

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.180 
breakthrough in design and that's to me
is<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.570> most<00:02:49.750> amazing<00:02:50.590> thing<00:02:50.800> about<00:02:50.830> the
