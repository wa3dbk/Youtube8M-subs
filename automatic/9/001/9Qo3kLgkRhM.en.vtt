that the black one it was a limited time
so<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.700> had<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.240> get<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.570> because<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.840> wasn't<00:03:38.020> sure

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so I had to get it because I wasn't sure

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
if they were still in Hazzard when I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.110 
if they were still in Hazzard when I
first<00:03:40.840> seen<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:42.310> was<00:03:42.490> all<00:03:42.640> right<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:42.790> didn't

like it that much

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.250 
like it that much
I<00:03:44.470> started<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.220> grow<00:03:45.400> on<00:03:45.430> me<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.270> went<00:03:47.080> ahead

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
I started to grow on me so I went ahead

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.210 
I started to grow on me so I went ahead
and<00:03:47.440> got<00:03:47.680> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.780
