of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> tracks<00:00:43.649> central<00:00:44.010> tracks<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> don't

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of the tracks central tracks now I don't

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.979 
of the tracks central tracks now I don't
usually<00:00:44.850> feature<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.690> channel

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
usually feature these on my channel

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990

haven't<00:00:46.559> yet<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.969> I

haven't yet this is the first time but I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
haven't yet this is the first time but I
figured<00:00:48.450> it'd<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.690> opportunity<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
figured it'd be a good opportunity to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
figured it'd be a good opportunity to
just<00:00:49.680> expose<00:00:50.250> many<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> new<00:00:51.149> fires<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
just expose many of the new fires that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
just expose many of the new fires that
