00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Let's go for a change 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.170
 again about a documentation and indeed 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.870
 about one dealing with the story 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.550
 of the oscar and the film world in general 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.940
 Hollywood is busy and that's it 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.940
 now around 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.300
 in the ledde to the oscar goes to 94 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.590
 minutes has been there was not 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.629
 known one would have actually as info 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.580
 films and fsk have 0 and that in the year 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.290
 2014 I'm pretty much on netflix 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.180
 looked at because she is not where she is now 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.199
 otherwise available and busy 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 to deal with the history of 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.120
 oscar award since its first 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 Awarded the 1929 in Hollywood in Los 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 angeles to this day or better 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 said year 2014 you have here 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.100
 collection of many great sequences 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 from old times and history 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.489
 worked up the edition of the first 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 Nobody knew what that was 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 really is not one has 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.120
 interested in keeping this price 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 he got something special 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 the next day you have something 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.070
 other things have been done but already 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.930
 previously known who the winners are the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 were previously notified of the press 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 only gradually has this 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.430
 happens to this size and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.930
 the most important film award in the world 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 develops and this is long gone 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 documented nicely to see that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.119
 in the first year and still have it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.300
 many hours of movies have been awarded 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.950
 are 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.229
 There were categories like best 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.789
 interim texts in a silent movie as 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 then he after to the sound film too 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.280
 has conquered this prize and always 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.959
 again it will be when people 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.429
 cut like liza minnelli like 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.740
 steven spielberg like george clooney like 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.270
 simply a whole armada very well known 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.920
 Actors also return from 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.479
 tell your childhood how they are 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.250
 Oscars have experienced how it was for them 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.720
 when you won 1 like yourself 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.310
 running behind the scenes has indeed 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 great shots of that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.849
 Backstage area if the winners with 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 her praises to the photocall afterwards 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.429
 go right behind the stage 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.599
 and so it is a very interesting one 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.310
 Insight into a world otherwise 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.330
 not to be seen when going ahead 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.619
 especially in recent decades, yet 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.819
 one has seen many movies 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.679
 many moments when you remember 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.300
 regularly also the oscars start and the 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.130
 is a completely different perspective on it 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.569
 I can only say that has me as a movie 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.530
 enthusiast really interested 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.259
 but find it a bit hard 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 to classify whether now the normal 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.720
 Documentation lover says yes 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.340
 is now something for me if I'm for 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 movies interested and dokus market but 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.550
 that beautiful interesting intersection 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.230
 because you look at netflix but 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.000
 does not cost that anyway 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.650
 to move in but at the end I mean 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 was really fascinated by the beautiful 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.190
 old archive footage mixed with new ones 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.170
 recordings and above all were also for 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 la quotes many categories 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.580
 in detail explains what these individual 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 mean categories and then what with the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.820
 special excellent that there is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.080
 to learn a lot and I have to 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.220
 I'm glad you looked at me 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.020
 have a focus and are none of me 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.460
 evaluation but here I wanted this 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.810
 make recommendations now what we 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.280
 so a bit in the heart lay and with it 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 i'm too through in my review too 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 Andy Oscar Goes To Last Can Be A Thumb 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.070
 if it likes, let it stay 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.120
 not otherwise that you know there is 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.430
 a few more left and me around and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.650
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.500
 new video and until then I hope here 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.500
 since may again , of course, at 3
