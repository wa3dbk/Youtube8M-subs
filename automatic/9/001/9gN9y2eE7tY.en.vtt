guitars<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.130> certainly<00:04:23.130> lends<00:04:23.370> itself<00:04:23.760> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
guitars and certainly lends itself to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.610 
guitars and certainly lends itself to
different<00:04:24.810> styles<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.200> play<00:04:25.410> more<00:04:26.340> easily<00:04:26.700> and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
different styles of play more easily and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.540 
different styles of play more easily and
normally<00:04:28.620> these<00:04:28.740> guitars<00:04:28.980> will<00:04:29.280> come<00:04:29.460> in

normally these guitars will come in
standard<00:04:29.790> scale<00:04:30.360> length<00:04:30.630> but<00:04:31.050> but<00:04:31.500> this

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
standard scale length but but this
