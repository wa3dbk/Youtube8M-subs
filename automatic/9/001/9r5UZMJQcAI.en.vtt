00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
happen but it lets me know that art has

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.760 
happen but it lets me know that art has
a<00:00:58.620> special<00:00:59.129> power<00:00:59.309> to<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:01.199> effect<00:01:01.590> some

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
a special power to to effect some

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
a special power to to effect some
changes<00:01:02.190> maybe<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.239> consciousness<00:01:03.719> or

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
changes maybe that consciousness or

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.550 
changes maybe that consciousness or
social<00:01:05.040> changes<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:07.200> used

social changes we see a lot of are used

social changes we see a lot of are used
for<00:01:07.920> political<00:01:08.520> propaganda<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> must<00:01:10.350> have

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
for political propaganda so it must have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460 
for political propaganda so it must have
some<00:01:10.740> power<00:01:11.720> I'd<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
some power I'd like to think that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
some power I'd like to think that

artists are the addition errs of the
future<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> conditioners<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.330> our<00:01:21.960> human

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
future and the conditioners of our human

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
future and the conditioners of our human
condition<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> indigenous<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.400> our

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
condition the indigenous of our

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
condition the indigenous of our
psychology<00:01:28.939> now<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.360> could<00:01:30.509> combine<00:01:30.780> all

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
psychology now that we could combine all

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.600 
psychology now that we could combine all
these<00:01:31.439> things<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610
