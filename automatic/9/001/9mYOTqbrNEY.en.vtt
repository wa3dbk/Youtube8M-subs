I'm always like I wish this was just a
little<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.720> better<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> narrative<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
little bit better it's the narrative you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
little bit better it's the narrative you
know<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> main<00:00:32.130> stories<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> lot

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
know the main stories there's not a lot

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
know the main stories there's not a lot
of<00:00:33.600> emotional<00:00:34.170> resonance<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of emotional resonance to get from a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.440 
of emotional resonance to get from a
character<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:35.910> you're<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.090> selecting

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
character where you're just selecting

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
character where you're just selecting
dialogue<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> can't<00:00:37.469> inflect<00:00:37.829> tone

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
dialogue you know you can't inflect tone

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.889 
dialogue you know you can't inflect tone
on<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> yeah<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.570> gonna<00:00:39.690> be

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
on to it yeah so I think that's gonna be

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
on to it yeah so I think that's gonna be
a<00:00:39.930> benefit<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.350> both<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> female<00:00:40.980> male

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
a benefit for both the female male

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.650 
a benefit for both the female male
protagonists<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.210> they've<00:00:42.329> recorded

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
protagonists I think they've recorded

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
protagonists I think they've recorded
for<00:00:43.290> four<00:00:43.500> years<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.160> something<00:00:44.340> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
for four years now or something or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
for four years now or something or
thirteen<00:00:45.030> thousand<00:00:45.450> lines<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> dialogue<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
thirteen thousand lines of dialogue so a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.069 
thirteen thousand lines of dialogue so a
piece<00:00:47.190> yeah<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.329> there's<00:00:48.629> some

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
piece yeah so I think there's some

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
piece yeah so I think there's some
possibility<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> story<00:00:50.280> will

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
possibility there that the story will

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.889 
possibility there that the story will
get<00:00:50.579> better<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.420> star<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> game

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
get better because the star of the game

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
get better because the star of the game
is<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> world<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.280> looking

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.749 
put your own personal stamp in the world
I<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.250> gonna<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.490> pretty

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
I think that's gonna be pretty

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
I think that's gonna be pretty
compelling<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> lot<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> people<00:01:27.810> MMX<00:01:28.259> has<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
compelling for a lot of people MMX has a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
compelling for a lot of people MMX has a
similar<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> home<00:01:29.790> based<00:01:30.119> thing

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
similar kind of home based thing

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.760 
similar kind of home based thing
although<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.259> several<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.680> them

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
although there are several of them

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
although there are several of them
throughout<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> world<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.659> upgrade

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
throughout the world and you upgrade

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.210 
throughout the world and you upgrade
those<00:01:34.200> by<00:01:34.350> doing<00:01:34.590> quests<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> people

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
those by doing quests for the people

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
those by doing quests for the people
that<00:01:35.280> live<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.420> hey

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that live there and you'll get like hey

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.270 
that live there and you'll get like hey
now<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.259> gonna<00:01:37.380> generate<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.920> scrap

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
now you're gonna generate more scrap

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.649 
now you're gonna generate more scrap
which<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> currency<00:01:39.299> or<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
which is kind of the currency or you do

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.910 
which is kind of the currency or you do
something<00:01:39.869> else<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.590> you'll<00:01:40.799> have

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
something else and you know you'll have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.639 
something else and you know you'll have
extra<00:01:41.490> ammo<00:01:41.909> refills<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> everything<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
extra ammo refills and everything so the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.690 
extra ammo refills and everything so the
component<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> doesn't<00:01:44.640> seem

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
component of that but it doesn't seem

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.280 
component of that but it doesn't seem
like<00:01:44.790> it'll<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.090> personalized<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.049> same

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
like it'll be personalized in the same

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
like it'll be personalized in the same
way<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:47.310> I've<00:01:47.399> seen<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:47.670> Mad<00:01:47.880> Max<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
way what I've seen from Mad Max is it is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.289 
way what I've seen from Mad Max is it is
virtually<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.920> unrelenting<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> its<00:01:51.060> tone

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
virtually like unrelenting in its tone

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
virtually like unrelenting in its tone
like<00:01:51.600> there's<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> comic<00:01:52.950> relief

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like there's not a lot of comic relief

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
like there's not a lot of comic relief
like<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.180> Fallout<00:01:54.450> games<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
like in the Fallout games you know I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
like in the Fallout games you know I
mean<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.320> Chum<00:01:55.530> Bucket<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> guy<00:01:56.070> who<00:01:56.130> rides

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
mean like Chum Bucket the guy who rides

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
mean like Chum Bucket the guy who rides
in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.909> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> silly<00:01:57.450> dude<00:01:57.659> but

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in the back is kind of a silly dude but

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.469 
in the back is kind of a silly dude but
it's<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> super<00:01:59.490> funny<00:01:59.820> jokey<00:02:00.270> game

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's not like a super funny jokey game

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
it's not like a super funny jokey game
like<00:02:00.869> follow<00:02:01.409> town<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like follow town is very different and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
like follow town is very different and
the<00:02:02.790> vehicular<00:02:03.420> sections<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:03.960> gonna<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.409> such

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the vehicular sections are gonna be such

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.440 
the vehicular sections are gonna be such
a<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:05.040> integral<00:02:05.399> part<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> Mad<00:02:05.939> Max<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.329> know

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
a more integral part of Mad Max you know

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
a more integral part of Mad Max you know
yeah<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.869> did<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.229> teases<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> fallout<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
yeah I did see teases that fallout you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
yeah I did see teases that fallout you
know<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> warship<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
know where there's like the warship that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.790 
know where there's like the warship that
was<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
was kind of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.290 
was kind of
hovering<00:02:11.160> above<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.670> saw<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> main

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
hovering above that we saw the main

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300 
hovering above that we saw the main
character<00:02:12.780> from<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> vault<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.440> into<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
character from the vault get into so it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.530 
character from the vault get into so it
does<00:02:14.490> look<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.730> they're<00:02:15.000> gonna<00:02:15.270> introduce

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
does look like they're gonna introduce

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.510 
does look like they're gonna introduce
some<00:02:15.900> vehicle<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> elements<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> follow<00:02:17.340> up

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
some vehicle and elements to follow up

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
some vehicle and elements to follow up
yeah<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.090> think<00:02:18.300> there's<00:02:18.630> definitely<00:02:18.960> gonna<00:02:19.050> be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
yeah I think there's definitely gonna be

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.570 
yeah I think there's definitely gonna be
a<00:02:19.230> different<00:02:19.440> flavor<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.220> gameplay

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a different flavor of the gameplay

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.460 
a different flavor of the gameplay
between<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> two<00:02:21.240> yeah<00:02:21.540> absolutely<00:02:21.870> that's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
between the two yeah absolutely that's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.840 
between the two yeah absolutely that's
probably<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> good<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.340> mad<00:02:23.490> bags

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
probably a good thing for mad bags

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.120 
probably a good thing for mad bags
yeah<00:02:24.000> I'm<00:02:24.360> generally<00:02:24.930> curious<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.500> how<00:02:25.740> much

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
yeah I'm generally curious like how much

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.770 
yeah I'm generally curious like how much
overlap<00:02:26.400> there<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> begin<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.690> know

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
overlap there is to begin with you know

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
overlap there is to begin with you know
because<00:02:28.110> they<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:29.010> different<00:02:29.430> games

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
because they are very different games

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.270 
because they are very different games
just<00:02:30.390> Mad<00:02:30.600> Max<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> real-time<00:02:31.500> punch

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
just Mad Max is like a real-time punch

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
just Mad Max is like a real-time punch
and<00:02:32.430> dudes<00:02:32.640> stab<00:02:33.240> another<00:02:33.540> face<00:02:33.690> harpooning

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and dudes stab another face harpooning

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
and dudes stab another face harpooning
amount<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.470> cars<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.890> stuff<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.130> that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
amount of cars and stuff like that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
amount of cars and stuff like that
whereas<00:02:35.910> fallout<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.600> know<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.900> vats

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
whereas fallout you know you have vats

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.540 
whereas fallout you know you have vats
to<00:02:37.410> kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> slow<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.070> pace<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
to kind of slow down the pace but you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.920 
to kind of slow down the pace but you
can<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.910> could<00:02:39.030> play<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
can you could play it kind of like a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.630 
can you could play it kind of like a
shooter<00:02:40.350> yeah<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:41.220> getting<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.520> little

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
shooter yeah that's getting a little

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.180 
shooter yeah that's getting a little
better<00:02:41.820> but<00:02:42.510> yeah<00:02:42.960> they're<00:02:43.140> using<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.040> they

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
better but yeah they're using that they

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.070 
better but yeah they're using that they
met<00:02:44.580> with<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.910> guys<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.600> kind<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.870> try<00:02:46.050> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
met with the it guys to kind of try to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.200 
met with the it guys to kind of try to
amp<00:02:46.350> up<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> shooting<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.070> yeah<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.030> think

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
amp up the shooting in yeah so I think

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.430 
amp up the shooting in yeah so I think
that<00:02:48.420> should<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.690> interesting<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> see<00:02:49.410> like

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that should be interesting to see like

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.710 
that should be interesting to see like
does<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.310> play<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> modern<00:02:51.210> shooter<00:02:51.570> now

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
does this play like a modern shooter now

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.910 
does this play like a modern shooter now
because<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.470> always<00:02:52.620> been<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
because you know it's always been a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.890 
because you know it's always been a
little<00:02:53.190> clunky<00:02:53.370> yeah<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.300> why<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.570> use

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
little clunky yeah and that's why I use

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.330 
little clunky yeah and that's why I use
vats<00:02:55.170> primarily<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> other<00:02:56.160> game

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
vats primarily in the other game

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.620 
vats primarily in the other game
especially<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.450> head<00:02:57.600> shot

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
especially you know go for the head shot

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.810 
especially you know go for the head shot
early<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:58.350> finish<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:58.740> off<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:58.920> some

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
early and then finish them off with some

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.650 
early and then finish them off with some
live<00:03:00.030> action

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
live action

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.020 
live action
oh<00:03:00.690> yeah<00:03:01.080> iPad<00:03:01.320> launcher<00:03:01.620> yeah<00:03:01.830> absolutely

Fallout trailer though well yet so I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.860 
Fallout trailer though well yet so I
looked<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.520> yeah<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.090> looks<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.660> are

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
looked up yeah it looks like they are

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.750 
looked up yeah it looks like they are
gonna<00:03:13.020> kind<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.530> try<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.860> lighten<00:03:14.490> up<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
gonna kind of try to lighten up the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.460 
gonna kind of try to lighten up the
pattern<00:03:15.120> they<00:03:15.270> did<00:03:15.720> talk<00:03:15.959> about<00:03:16.020> there's

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
pattern they did talk about there's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
pattern they did talk about there's
gonna<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.980> where<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.489> blast<00:03:17.730> radius<00:03:18.000> was

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
gonna be like where the blast radius was

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.910 
gonna be like where the blast radius was
that's<00:03:18.540> gonna<00:03:18.780> look<00:03:19.020> like<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.530> grays<00:03:19.890> and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that's gonna look like the grays and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.790 
that's gonna look like the grays and
ugly<00:03:20.730> Browns<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.570> saw<00:03:21.810> basically<00:03:22.410> all

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
ugly Browns that you saw basically all

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.710 
ugly Browns that you saw basically all
of<00:03:22.980> Fallout<00:03:23.310> 3<00:03:23.580> yeah<00:03:23.880> yeah<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.570> are

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
of Fallout 3 yeah yeah but they are

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.390 
of Fallout 3 yeah yeah but they are
gonna<00:03:24.930> try<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.140> lighten<00:03:25.470> up<00:03:25.530> other<00:03:25.709> areas<00:03:26.130> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
gonna try to lighten up other areas and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.180 
gonna try to lighten up other areas and
kind<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.610> introduce<00:03:26.970> some<00:03:27.239> environmental

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
kind of introduce some environmental

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.870 
kind of introduce some environmental
differentiation<00:03:29.190> which<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.459> think<00:03:29.670> will<00:03:29.760> be

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
differentiation which I think will be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.370 
differentiation which I think will be
important<00:03:30.270> for<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.420> game<00:03:30.570> we<00:03:31.050> saw<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:31.320> of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
important for the game we saw some of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.870 
important for the game we saw some of
that<00:03:31.500> med<00:03:31.680> max<00:03:31.890> too<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.670> by<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
that med max too but I think by and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
that med max too but I think by and
large<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.300> not<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.600> stylized<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:34.590> maybe

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
large it's not as stylized as maybe

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.350 
large it's not as stylized as maybe
follow<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.370> might<00:03:35.520> be<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.000> know<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.209> got<00:03:36.330> a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
follow it might be you know it's got a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.630 
follow it might be you know it's got a
very<00:03:36.570> distinct<00:03:37.320> visual<00:03:37.709> kind<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.130> thing

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
very distinct visual kind of thing

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.949 
very distinct visual kind of thing
they're<00:03:38.790> shooting<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.270> Mad<00:03:39.450> Max<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.780> more

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
they're shooting for Mad Max is more

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.140 
they're shooting for Mad Max is more
like<00:03:40.500> grounded<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.190> realistic<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.910> just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
like grounded and realistic and just

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.510 
like grounded and realistic and just
super<00:03:42.360> grim<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.320> think<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.430> looking

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
super grim so I think if you're looking

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.460 
super grim so I think if you're looking
for<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> sad<00:03:45.090> time<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.720> think<00:03:45.930> Mad<00:03:46.050> Max<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
for a sad time I think Mad Max is

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.620 
for a sad time I think Mad Max is
probably<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.860> we<00:03:46.920> gotta<00:03:47.070> go<00:03:47.250> sad<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.450> bloody

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
probably that we gotta go sad and bloody

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.120 
probably that we gotta go sad and bloody
and<00:03:48.989> if<00:03:49.110> you're<00:03:49.230> looking<00:03:49.470> for<00:03:49.650> bloody<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
and if you're looking for bloody and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.860 
and if you're looking for bloody and
