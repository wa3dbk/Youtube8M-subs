 after choosing him to purchase XL costs him normal mode 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 Judith or Ska short time for prank or altar 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 Blow up Kate

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.510
 Can you drive for that Hunter so parking was created for a game 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.690
 Team sprint by simply fingering 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.480
 short with your finger 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.810
 the display touches 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.229
 we want to use stretch so poses no no 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.690
 first 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.440
 So then changed - eg Red 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.840
 Now, though, could do so 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.610
 you have to be careful 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 there are extra points 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.040
 Kappels some +3 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 Kohlschreiber can show a rich bottom line 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.799
 after Katie lot of fun man records even after 11pm so 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.529
 Judith or benchmarks almost never pieces 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.529
 there had been the top edge ad learns the subject quickly this 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.679
 Hiking can raise children else 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.109
 be moved 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.109
 Small and men dar that is the bite more fuel 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.789
 I'm talking pretty badly 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
 if records are still 28 with songs squad 11 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.799
 Although being here and there is simply fun can come 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.590
 Cult around 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.000
 Altogether I have a lot of fun with his successor Scooter 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.759
 tasted 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.849
 he stands then south wind here 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 The Cantina had to touch on building so early on building 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.289
 to introduce the topic 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.639
 Khaled is very bad of Dirk Neupert are now if he is one then 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.639
 I have no time - 1 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.169
 and percent the fourth variant percent 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.099
 Tesla wants it like he does when a man has to go with a few extras 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.230
 For example, the platform gets smaller with the iPad 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.719
 you have to bring these things 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.329
 so Hewitt then for example so the threads for the combative 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.519
 good 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.019
 so guaranteed if the platform big stage caught that 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.620
 it's going to be good but also pretty difficult Bergenien is even for the platform 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.179
 smaller there are a few new gadgets 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.039
 Not everyone is showing that up now 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.789
 we come to the next stop 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.829
 never concerns yet show the new venue 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.639
 Hmmm 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.039
 without ground 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.699
 I think it's class 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.779
 a few games with the man 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.239
 The iPod pulled this format can leave 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.389
 pleads briefly 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.119
 that was it 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.399
 he has percent here 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:01.260
 Records 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.739
 Bergfest gets awake you can see the record sum of today 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.499
 facebook profile deleted it is not going to me 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.339
 then he could choose statistics 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.819
 when they think have played a lot of games illogical is already you had 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.789
 their average corp 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:16.920
 our teams 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.299
 Spidey did not do that completely 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.339
 Thus, stormy selects are child's man-shares 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.860
 No, the rosters 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.219
 not just take the ball his style is boring though 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.340
 That's fun 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.830
 Rome Zack 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.069
 Softwood me well 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.069
 then you have one more try 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.379
 Spaan 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.650
 Percent the whole gives 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.499
 14 laps 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.809
 it is not difficult 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 but it's fun to be fate easy 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.710
 Thomas is fun 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.449
 I think it's very nice Richemont 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.439
 the others have uplifted catholic many who free you to show me 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.439
 still free he take this painted as oil paintings 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.349
 now as must chalk somehow 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.469
 you have the rights still short 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.559
 so that's a principle that just looks a bit different 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.499
 that was cool, it's fun for us to keep on doing good stuff 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.719
 Reviews are promises costs so far what you with percent 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.110
 For us there is no heart right now the economy could rise 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.210
 theirs 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.770
 with and welcomed 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.770
 Melchert gives and lung cancer 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.360
 That's why I'm telling you a lot 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.949
 a lot has been sold by the baton 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.770
 I did not buy them now but more 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.180
 min by Manuel Kripp I should get 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.460
 and percent 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.270
 Evaluate the possibility 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.919
 in a lot of words how to choose 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.039
 Now it's just taste so Herrmann 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.630
 it gives up, for example 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.630
 All of Egypt is here 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.529
 Bang bag then express plans 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.529
 4 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.509
 but no sense the city of Worms has attacked so sold the cow 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.969
 in return, Chris should be big 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.969
 fix 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.659
 Of course, BP can also percent it to me again 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:31.909
 Melbourne is alright 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.559
 4 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.559
 Underwear already 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.900
 fca keeper of a changed world 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.099
 4 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.099
 McCann 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.409
 so of course their sympathy so funny but we have it in the car 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.749
 and radio reception and then done it at full volume so well 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.749
 a traffic light miller since looked at it funny 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.409
 So, for example, I still find it funny 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.749
 Demirel 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.119
 4 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.479
 Nick Folk Zander 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.029
 5 by tolerated Kurt NASCAR 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.649
 that's almost as bad as union 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:20.600
 but no matter 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.700
 earlier that was driving it to a protector of crime or little bit 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.529
 helped 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:25.469
 Until next time
