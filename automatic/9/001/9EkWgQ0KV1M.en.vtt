00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hi, I hope you are very well in this 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.330
 I come to bring you a video about 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.800
 the structure and the cover of the project 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.410
 who had told them that it is 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.760
 set with other girls that is called 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.689
 life is a cut and good to this there 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.679
 several requirements for the cover and the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.650
 structure is how one would like in 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.349
 how much the requirements were made for 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.329
 each page and for the cover these 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.550
 they made altogether for which it was taken 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.379
 consider the material with which 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.100
 we counted all and well this is this my 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:48.380
 cover that I had already shown you in 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.410
 instagram a picture of it and it's like that 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.960
 as requirements you have to have first 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.629
 the title that is life is a cut 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.740
 and I put it with followed and then I 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.040
 I put the gloss and excel 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.710
 then I had to have tickets that good 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.310
 one or several and I put two that are 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.820
 these and here I put you 2014 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.090
 then I had to have a camera that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.710
 is that it is a sticker of these chubby 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.180
 I do not know what material it is but 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.210
 also curious and then another that was a 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.470
 butterfly that is here that is from 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:35.570
 chubut and has as well as diamond 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.360
 new hearts that here have them I 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.170
 I put 3 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 I also had to have 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 false cooked that is here in all 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 around 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 so I had to have paint of that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 of relief and I put these balls 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.830
 Good thing I do not have relief painting 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.130
 but I put him 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.870
 of this silicone that is put with the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.870
 gun but that has adamantine 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:14.010
 and I put several like that on different tips 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.330
 sizes and finally I had something 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.980
 pink and good here is in 2014 in pink 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:28.860
 the fake false stitched in pink the camera 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 and the hearts also in the butterfly and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.580
 all this that is like the spine is also 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 pink and apart I added this that is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.690
 cutting 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.260
 that I like a lot from my favorites 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 This is a little fabric flower and a 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.740
 stopper ol that I already told you that this 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.830
 way gift to your dinner 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.710
 and here it is here also has false 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.710
 cooked equal in the chamber 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.560
 and I think it would be all good the successes 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.890
 the tickets are followed and I put them in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.390
 a blue cardboard 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.810
 and I'm going to the cuts 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.709
 As for the structure, I made it like that 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:29.060
 which is in accordion form but so 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:33.260
 simple and I used four sheets of no three 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.240
 hours and a half of opaline of the most 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.069
 thick or good I do not know if it's the most 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 thick but this has been progressing 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.870
 and so it is with this loin 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 I use this cardboard 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.730
 and here's good this is nothing else for now 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.230
 because it ends here let's go let's do 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.690
 another thing that also has its 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.740
 Requirements 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.210
 there I need to tell you that to 15 the one that already 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.500
 I had shown you that you as 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:10.280
 stencil in my mini album the cupcake that 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.270
 it's like a ribbon or something like that and what 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.900
 I tried with blue ink on these 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.100
 parts 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.950
 same here 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 and well that would be all I hope that you 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.230
 Like I'll leave you some pictures of how 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.840
 it was more or less doing in case 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.300
 someone wants to make a mini of this 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.520
 way that is very simple 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.060
 well see you in the next video that 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.060
 be very good
