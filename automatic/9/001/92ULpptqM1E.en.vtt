what I'm holding right here is almost
the<00:00:36.719> same<00:00:36.870> geometry<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> Madone<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the same geometry as the Madone and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
the same geometry as the Madone and
they're<00:00:38.850> making<00:00:39.059> another<00:00:39.450> model<00:00:39.809> soon<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
they're making another model soon that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.229 
they're making another model soon that
will<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.190> even<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.640> aggressive<00:00:41.760> than<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
will be even more aggressive than the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
will be even more aggressive than the
current<00:00:42.480> classics<00:00:42.899> edition<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> case

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
current classics edition so in the case

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
current classics edition so in the case
of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> Bissel<00:00:44.910> development<00:00:45.690> team<00:00:45.840> they're

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of the Bissel development team they're

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the Bissel development team they're
split<00:00:47.070> pretty<00:00:47.370> evenly<00:00:47.670> between<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.090> Madone

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
split pretty evenly between the Madone

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
split pretty evenly between the Madone
and<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> demonic<00:00:48.840> here's<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.770> example<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and the demonic here's an example of a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
and the demonic here's an example of a
lightweight<00:00:50.820> race<00:00:51.149> bike<00:00:51.390> versus<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> narrow

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
lightweight race bike versus a narrow

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
lightweight race bike versus a narrow
bike<00:00:52.559> Logan<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.370> talk<00:00:53.579> us<00:00:53.699> through<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
bike Logan can you talk us through the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
bike Logan can you talk us through the
differences<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> why<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> rider<00:00:54.930> may<00:00:55.199> choose

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
differences and why a rider may choose

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
differences and why a rider may choose
one<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> best

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
one or the other so I think the best

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.510 
one or the other so I think the best
example<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> case<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> Chad<00:00:59.160> Haga

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
example in this case is that Chad Haga

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.569 
example in this case is that Chad Haga
who<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> GC<00:01:01.199> contenders<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> TCR

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
who is more of a GC contenders on a TCR

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
who is more of a GC contenders on a TCR
which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.090> lighter<00:01:03.300> weight<00:01:03.570> bike<00:01:03.899> for

and the Madone the Madone is considered

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.859 
and the Madone the Madone is considered
a<00:01:37.200> narrow<00:01:37.409> road<00:01:37.650> bike<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.460> as

a narrow road bike but it's not as

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
aggressively aerodynamic as a propel so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
aggressively aerodynamic as a propel so
the<00:01:41.939> advantages<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:43.189> dramatic<00:01:44.189> as

Demonte<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.579> very<00:01:48.570> quick<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.140> also

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
Demonte is very quick but it's also

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
Demonte is very quick but it's also
quite<00:01:50.100> comfortable<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> has<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> iso<00:01:51.210> speed

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390

lot of time in the saddle day after day

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
lot of time in the saddle day after day
it's<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> smooth<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> road

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's going to smooth out the road

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.999 
it's going to smooth out the road
so<00:01:57.659> does<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> right<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.439> choose<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.799> bikes

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so does it right to choose that bikes

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
so does it right to choose that bikes
based<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.460> their<00:01:59.579> own<00:01:59.670> strengths<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.329> based<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
based on their own strengths so based on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
based on their own strengths so based on
the<00:02:01.110> races<00:02:01.439> they<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> perform<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.189> both

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the races they want to perform it both

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.319 
the races they want to perform it both
at<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.990> race<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.619> Torre<00:02:05.100> California<00:02:05.700> they're

it's a more comfortable ride it's a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.059 
it's a more comfortable ride it's a
little<00:02:57.750> bit<00:02:57.870> heavier<00:02:58.140> than<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> module<00:02:58.739> but

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
little bit heavier than the module but

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.240 
little bit heavier than the module but
for<00:02:59.880> me<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.420> feel<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.230> I'll<00:03:01.470> save<00:03:01.709> Watts<00:03:01.980> by

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.040 
for me I feel like I'll save Watts by
not<00:03:03.000> hitting<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.390> brakes<00:03:03.600> because<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.900> feel

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
not hitting the brakes because I feel

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.559 
not hitting the brakes because I feel
more<00:03:04.200> comfortable<00:03:04.530> than<00:03:05.269> saving<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.450> in

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
more comfortable than saving it in

looking we've seen how the pros choose a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.479 
looking we've seen how the pros choose a
frame<00:03:18.299> how<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.350> consumer<00:03:19.530> apply<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.220> to
