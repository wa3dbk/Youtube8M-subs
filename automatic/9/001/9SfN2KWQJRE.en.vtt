doing fantastic I'm sorry I had to leave

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700 
doing fantastic I'm sorry I had to leave
a<00:00:05.730> little<00:00:06.000> early<00:00:06.240> yesterday<00:00:06.720> but<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.500> looks

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
a little early yesterday but it looks

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.160 
a little early yesterday but it looks
like<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.130> had<00:00:08.340> some<00:00:09.120> interesting<00:00:09.929> things

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
like you had some interesting things

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.470 
like you had some interesting things
going<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.010> cleaned<00:00:11.340> up<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.670> little<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.360> he

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
going and cleaned up a little bit but he

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560 
going and cleaned up a little bit but he
pulls<00:00:12.780> away<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.860> then<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.309> took<00:00:14.370> these<00:00:14.759> Pistons

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
pulls away and then I took these Pistons

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.250 
pulls away and then I took these Pistons
Pistons

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
Pistons

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.000 
Pistons
this<00:00:16.830> piston<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.580> couldn't<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:19.010> we

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this piston that we couldn't have and we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
this piston that we couldn't have and we
spent<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.400> lot<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.760> time<00:00:21.119> trying<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.810> these

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
spent a lot of time trying to get these

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
spent a lot of time trying to get these
connecting<00:00:22.650> rods<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.460> center<00:00:23.880> Oh<00:00:24.060> game

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
connecting rods in the center Oh game

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.460 
connecting rods in the center Oh game
over<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.939> easy<00:00:27.210> prior<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.230> about

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
over right and not easy prior to about

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
over right and not easy prior to about
nineteen<00:00:28.949> thirty<00:00:29.250> three<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
nineteen thirty three because the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
nineteen thirty three because the
crankcase<00:00:30.420> halves<00:00:30.869> were<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.619> depths

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
crankcase halves were different depths

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970 
crankcase halves were different depths
that<00:00:32.180> washer<00:00:33.180> car<00:00:33.719> before<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.320> weird<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.770> Fleur

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that washer car before is weird it Fleur

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
that washer car before is weird it Fleur
and<00:00:35.040> gaps<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and gaps and so you got a lot of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.350 
and gaps and so you got a lot of
mathematics<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> middle

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
mathematics to get them in the middle

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.380 
mathematics to get them in the middle
now<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.469> need<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.219> find<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.910> are

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
now what we need to do is find out are

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
now what we need to do is find out are
they<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> middle<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> did<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
they in the middle so what I did this is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.229 
they in the middle so what I did this is
a<00:00:44.820> piston<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.860> had<00:00:46.860> cut<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.190> half<00:00:47.430> Roy<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a piston that we had cut in half Roy and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.260 
a piston that we had cut in half Roy and
so<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> wasn't<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.559> yet<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> did<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so on it wasn't very yet so what I did I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
so on it wasn't very yet so what I did I
took<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> Bridgeport<00:00:52.920> took<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
took a little bit of Bridgeport took a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
took a little bit of Bridgeport took a
long<00:00:54.329> rod<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.910> put<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.770> enough<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
long rod and put it down on enough in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.510 
long rod and put it down on enough in
the<00:00:59.190> vise<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.699> two<00:00:59.940> parallels<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.410> paste<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the vise on two parallels and paste it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
the vise on two parallels and paste it
off<00:01:02.699> perfectly<00:01:03.600> accurate<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
off perfectly accurate with this then I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.690 
off perfectly accurate with this then I
went<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.360> machine<00:01:06.750> mill<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
went in here and I machine mill this so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.719 
went in here and I machine mill this so
that<00:01:08.939> these<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.479> absolutely<00:01:10.229> equal<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.700> both

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that these are absolutely equal on both

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
that these are absolutely equal on both
sides<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.340> now<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.600> our<00:01:15.900> motor<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
sides and now we can take our motor and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.749 
sides and now we can take our motor and
we<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.880> our<00:01:18.210> half<00:01:18.479> piston<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> here

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.770 

and<00:01:22.329> now<00:01:22.509> we<00:01:22.570> can<00:01:22.899> just<00:01:22.930> look<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.520> see<00:01:25.270> if<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
and now we can just look and see if the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.170 
and now we can just look and see if the
connecting<00:01:26.259> rod<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.469> in<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.039> middle<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.880> it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
connecting rod is in the middle and it

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.649 
connecting rod is in the middle and it
is<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:30.100> same<00:01:30.369> thing<00:01:30.610> with<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.909> other<00:01:31.030> half

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
is the same thing with the other half

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.020 
is the same thing with the other half
this<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.710> single<00:01:33.070> rod<00:01:33.280> which<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.820> rear

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
this is the single rod which is the rear

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.889 
this is the single rod which is the rear
rod<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.530> one<00:01:35.740> over<00:01:35.860> here<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.909> what

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
rod and this one over here is the what

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.830 
rod and this one over here is the what
we're<00:01:38.079> looking<00:01:38.409> at<00:01:38.439> here<00:01:38.679> is<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.299> distance

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
we're looking at here is this distance

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.359 
we're looking at here is this distance
between<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.380> bronze<00:01:41.619> bushing<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
between the bronze bushing and the

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.270 
between the bronze bushing and the
piston<00:01:42.789> rod<00:01:43.210> pushing<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.990> piston<00:01:44.409> and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
piston rod pushing in the piston and

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.340 
piston rod pushing in the piston and
then<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.299> same<00:01:46.539> over<00:01:46.899> here

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
then the same over here

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.649 
then the same over here
between<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.369> piston<00:01:48.850> where<00:01:49.299> it's<00:01:49.450> been

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
between the piston where it's been

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.469 
between the piston where it's been
machined<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.679> bronze<00:01:50.920> bushing<00:01:51.399> so<00:01:51.640> we

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
machined in the bronze bushing so we

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.809 
machined in the bronze bushing so we
have<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.659> motor<00:01:52.990> now<00:01:53.289> with<00:01:54.039> connecting<00:01:54.610> rods

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
have a motor now with connecting rods

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.770 
have a motor now with connecting rods
that<00:01:55.090> are<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.709> middle

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that are in the middle

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.230 
that are in the middle
dead<00:01:58.780> center<00:01:59.439> what<00:02:00.369> happens<00:02:00.759> if<00:02:00.909> they're<00:02:01.090> not

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
dead center what happens if they're not

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.229 
dead center what happens if they're not
I<00:02:01.990> think<00:02:02.349> we<00:02:02.500> showed<00:02:02.740> in<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.069> previous<00:02:05.220> video

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
I think we showed in a previous video

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.280 
I think we showed in a previous video
and<00:02:08.549> what<00:02:09.549> this<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> was<00:02:10.660> trying<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.079> do

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
and what this what it was trying to do

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.539 
and what this what it was trying to do
was<00:02:11.500> -<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.769> was<00:02:11.890> trying<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> push<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.819> clip<00:02:13.540> out

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
was - it was trying to push the clip out

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.309 
was - it was trying to push the clip out
it<00:02:15.549> almost<00:02:16.000> went<00:02:16.360> into<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.690> cylinder<00:02:17.079> wall

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
it almost went into the cylinder wall

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.949 
it almost went into the cylinder wall
not<00:02:17.860> quite<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.060> was<00:02:19.239> pushing<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.780> out

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
not quite but it was pushing this out

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.900 
not quite but it was pushing this out
nine<00:02:20.260> thousand<00:02:20.799> six<00:02:21.010> hundred<00:02:21.130> miles<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.730> took

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
nine thousand six hundred miles it took

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.930 
nine thousand six hundred miles it took
to<00:02:22.060> do<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:23.069> what<00:02:24.069> had<00:02:24.250> happened<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.790> had

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
to do that and what had happened I had

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.849 
to do that and what had happened I had
made<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.269> an<00:02:25.390> earlier<00:02:25.870> error<00:02:26.519> way<00:02:27.519> back<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
made it an earlier error way back and

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.940 
made it an earlier error way back and
these<00:02:29.859> pistons<00:02:30.340> were<00:02:30.489> off-center<00:02:31.060> about<00:02:31.329> 80

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
these pistons were off-center about 80

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.360 
these pistons were off-center about 80
82<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.280> 86<00:02:33.850> thousand<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.810> had<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.200> lot<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.709> that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
82 or 86 thousand we had a lot and that

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.030 
82 or 86 thousand we had a lot and that
will<00:02:36.579> cause<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.150> Brisbin<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.260> push<00:02:38.590> off<00:02:38.829> to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
will cause the Brisbin to push off to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.849 
will cause the Brisbin to push off to
one<00:02:39.220> side<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:41.549> anyhow<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.910> much<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.329> that

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
one side so anyhow so much for that

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.479 
one side so anyhow so much for that
pistons<00:02:44.859> are<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.850> center<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.690> motor

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
pistons are in the center of the motor

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.580 
pistons are in the center of the motor
center<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.609> the<00:02:48.670> cylinders<00:02:49.350> connecting<00:02:50.350> rods

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
center of the cylinders connecting rods

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.059 
center of the cylinders connecting rods
connecting<00:02:51.250> rods<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.049> connector<00:02:53.920> eyes

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
connecting rods in the connector eyes

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.400 
connecting rods in the connector eyes
are<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> center<00:02:54.760> distance<00:02:55.359> also<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.319> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
are in the center distance also in the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.350 
are in the center distance also in the
center<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.920> cell

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
center of the cell

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.590 
center of the cell
so<00:02:57.990> one<00:02:58.410> more<00:02:59.010> question<00:02:59.040> before<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.030> go<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so one more question before we go to the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.110 
so one more question before we go to the
eatery<00:03:00.960> for<00:03:01.320> breakfast<00:03:01.830> which<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.520> every

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
eatery for breakfast which we do every

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720 
eatery for breakfast which we do every
day<00:03:03.170> every<00:03:04.170> morning<00:03:04.350> every<00:03:05.100> morning

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
day every morning every morning

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.370 
day every morning every morning
are<00:03:06.660> there<00:03:06.930> any<00:03:09.020> possible<00:03:11.570> forces<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:13.200> are

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
are there any possible forces that are

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.560 
are there any possible forces that are
going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.590> cause<00:03:13.830> these<00:03:14.190> connecting<00:03:14.820> rods<00:03:15.090> to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
going to cause these connecting rods to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.380 
going to cause these connecting rods to
move<00:03:15.900> from<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.980> center<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.490> got<00:03:17.670> them<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
move from the center we got them in the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.080 
move from the center we got them in the
center<00:03:18.780> when<00:03:19.710> this<00:03:19.920> engine<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.960> know<00:03:22.380> dead

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
center when this engine is you know dead

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.200 
center when this engine is you know dead
stopped<00:03:24.090> what<00:03:24.930> might<00:03:25.170> happen<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.710> might

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
stopped what might happen that might

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.150 
stopped what might happen that might
cause<00:03:27.210> the<00:03:27.720> connecting<00:03:28.170> rods<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.710> be<00:03:28.860> pushed

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
cause the connecting rods to be pushed

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.580 
cause the connecting rods to be pushed
to<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:29.400> side<00:03:29.580> or<00:03:30.030> another<00:03:30.240> or<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:31.050> bend<00:03:31.320> you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
to one side or another or to bend you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.030 
to one side or another or to bend you
might<00:03:31.830> say<00:03:32.190> yeah<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.060> bend<00:03:33.300> yeah<00:03:33.920> nothing<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
might say yeah or to bend yeah nothing I

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
know of when when you actually put a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.120 
know of when when you actually put a
connecting<00:03:38.220> rod<00:03:39.020> on<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.080> big<00:03:40.380> ride<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
connecting rod on a big ride on the

bottom and a small rod on the top and

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.040 
bottom and a small rod on the top and
start<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.680> move<00:03:44.160> them<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> try<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.850> them<00:03:45.209> you

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
start to move them to try to them you

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.830 
start to move them to try to them you
have<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.470> go<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.980> far<00:03:47.400> past<00:03:47.790> their<00:03:48.630> light

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
have to go so far past their light

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.040 
have to go so far past their light
almost<00:03:49.260> like<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> leaf<00:03:49.709> spring<00:03:50.030> there's<00:03:51.050> very

the Cannonball where we're trying to go

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.880 
the Cannonball where we're trying to go
to<00:04:02.360> 25,000<00:04:03.360> mile<00:04:03.600> bottom<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.680> may<00:04:04.860> not

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
to 25,000 mile bottom and that may not

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.420 
to 25,000 mile bottom and that may not
sound<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.640> much<00:04:05.790> today<00:04:06.300> but<00:04:07.200> back<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.620> 1929

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
will be roughly the first four thousand

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.969 
will be roughly the first four thousand
of<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:19.949> 25<00:04:20.959> hopefully<00:04:21.959> very<00:04:22.350> cool<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> think
