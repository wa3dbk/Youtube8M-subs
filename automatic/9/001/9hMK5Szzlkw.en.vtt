hello<00:00:00.870> everyone<00:00:01.350> in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:03.060> going

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello everyone in this video I'm going

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.160 
hello everyone in this video I'm going
to<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.510> talking<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:04.759> particular<00:00:05.759> about<00:00:06.170> distal

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
to be talking in particular about distal

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.459 
to be talking in particular about distal
angular<00:00:07.560> lower<00:00:07.980> third<00:00:08.370> molars<00:00:09.080> it's<00:00:10.080> really<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
angular lower third molars it's really a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.850 
angular lower third molars it's really a
continuation<00:00:11.040> from<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.910> other<00:00:12.090> video<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.870> my

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
continuation from the other video on my

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.580 
continuation from the other video on my
thoughts<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.429> bone<00:00:14.700> removal<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.809> tooth

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
thoughts on bone removal and tooth

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.730 
thoughts on bone removal and tooth
sectioning<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> thought<00:00:18.199> another<00:00:19.199> little

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
sectioning but I thought another little

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
sectioning but I thought another little
video<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.340> particular<00:00:20.880> relating<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.900> distal

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
video in particular relating to distal

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.810 
video in particular relating to distal
angular's<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.970> can<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.060> helpful<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:25.289> really

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
angular's is can be helpful so in really

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.660 
angular's is can be helpful so in really
revision<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.990> last<00:00:28.230> video<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
revision of the last video here is that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.179 
revision of the last video here is that
same<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.480> slightly<00:00:31.050> distal<00:00:31.529> angular<00:00:31.949> third

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
same this slightly distal angular third

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.630 
same this slightly distal angular third
molar<00:00:32.460> again<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> remind<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.320> on

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
molar again and just to remind you on

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
molar again and just to remind you on
the<00:00:35.640> principles<00:00:36.180> again<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.840> talking

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the principles again that I was talking

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
the principles again that I was talking
about<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.820> distal<00:00:39.270> bone<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.719> what's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
about is that this distal bone is what's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
about is that this distal bone is what's
going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> most<00:00:40.620> likely<00:00:41.300> impacting<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going to be most likely impacting the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
going to be most likely impacting the
tooth<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.930> coming<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.340> ideally<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
tooth from coming out so ideally we

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.209 
tooth from coming out so ideally we
should<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.450> an<00:00:45.629> oblique<00:00:45.840> section<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.860> give<00:00:47.070> us

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
should do an oblique section to give us

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.360 
should do an oblique section to give us
most<00:00:47.550> visibility<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> distal<00:00:49.890> bone<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
most visibility to the distal bone and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.650 
most visibility to the distal bone and
also<00:00:51.120> creating<00:00:51.660> space<00:00:52.250> distal<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
also creating space distal so that the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
also creating space distal so that the
truth<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:54.930> elevate<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.960> then<00:00:58.219> also<00:00:59.300> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
truth can elevate out and then also to

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
truth can elevate out and then also to
maintain<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> mesial<00:01:01.890> application<00:01:02.430> point<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
maintain the mesial application point of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
maintain the mesial application point of
course<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> only<00:01:04.260> way<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> do

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
course this is not the only way to do

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.179 
course this is not the only way to do
things

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
things

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.910 
things
you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.119> section<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.200> which

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you can also section it like this which

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
you can also section it like this which
will<00:01:08.070> also<00:01:08.250> give<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.670> access<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> distal

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
will also give you access to the distal

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
will also give you access to the distal
bone<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:11.040> might<00:01:11.250> argue<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
bone but some might argue that a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 
bone but some might argue that a
straight<00:01:12.570> section<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:14.340> give

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
straight section like this doesn't give

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
straight section like this doesn't give
you<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.880> much<00:01:15.210> vision<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> distal<00:01:16.950> bone

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you as much vision into the distal bone

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
you as much vision into the distal bone
area<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.090> might<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.420> able<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.780> section<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
area but it might be able to section the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
area but it might be able to section the
truth<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.820> especially<00:01:21.540> where<00:01:21.659> next<00:01:21.810> two

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
truth in to especially where next two

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800 
truth in to especially where next two
roots<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.710> also<00:01:22.860> keeps<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.299> mesial

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
roots and it also keeps the mesial

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.140 
roots and it also keeps the mesial
application<00:01:25.380> point<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:26.430> people<00:01:26.460> though

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
application point some people though

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.620 
application point some people though
like<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.140> dechlorinate<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.579> okay<00:01:30.090> because

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like to dechlorinate that's okay because

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590 
like to dechlorinate that's okay because
you<00:01:30.990> also<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.590> access<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> distal<00:01:33.329> bone

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you also get access to the distal bone

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
you also get access to the distal bone
but<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.590> tend<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> lose<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.220> mesial

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but you tend to lose your mesial

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
but you tend to lose your mesial
application<00:01:36.570> point<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> sometimes<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.220> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
application point and sometimes it can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.679 
application point and sometimes it can
make<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.759> life<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.509> more

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
make your life a little bit more

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.830 
make your life a little bit more
difficult<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.970> pros<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> cons<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.570> each

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
difficult so pros and cons for each

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.219 
difficult so pros and cons for each
method<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.770> again<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.490> about

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
method and I think again is all about

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.690 
method and I think again is all about
assessing<00:01:46.229> each<00:01:46.380> individual<00:01:47.009> tooth<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.520> see

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
assessing each individual tooth to see

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.960 
assessing each individual tooth to see
what's<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> best<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:48.869> doing<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
what's the best way to go about doing it

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.660 
what's the best way to go about doing it
now<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:52.009> tooth<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
now this was a tooth that I did just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.200 
now this was a tooth that I did just
recently<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.009> looking<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> x-ray<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
recently and looking at this x-ray you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
recently and looking at this x-ray you
might<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.659> oh<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
might think oh this is not kind of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.469 
might think oh this is not kind of
coming<00:01:59.820> too<00:02:00.000> hard

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
coming too hard

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.080 
coming too hard
because<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.380> has<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.219> short<00:02:02.460> route<00:02:02.790> but

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
because it has a very short route but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.319 
because it has a very short route but
this<00:02:03.990> tooth<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.310> tilted<00:02:05.880> buccal

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
this tooth was actually tilted buccal

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.619 
this tooth was actually tilted buccal
lingual<00:02:06.360> II<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.819> whenever<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> short

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
lingual II and whenever you see a short

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.710 
lingual II and whenever you see a short
tooth<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
tooth like this you got to think that it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.880 
tooth like this you got to think that it
is<00:02:12.959> tilted<00:02:13.230> buckling

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is tilted buckling

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.330 
is tilted buckling
ghuli<00:02:14.130> especially<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.930> see<00:02:16.140> more<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
ghuli especially if you can see more a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.170 
ghuli especially if you can see more a
cruise<00:02:17.910> or

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
cruise or

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.740 
cruise or
Anatomy<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.680> OPG<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.180> case<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
Anatomy on the OPG so in this case I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.690 
Anatomy on the OPG so in this case I
knew<00:02:22.380> straight<00:02:22.740> away<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:23.280> buccal<00:02:23.670> lingual

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
knew straight away was buccal lingual

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
knew straight away was buccal lingual
but<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> didn't<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.660> whether<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.140> cast<00:02:25.560> was

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
but I didn't know whether the cast was

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.130 
but I didn't know whether the cast was
that<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> crown<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:27.000> facing<00:02:27.450> back<00:02:27.690> or<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that the crown was facing back or the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
that the crown was facing back or the
crown<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.530> facing<00:02:28.950> lingual<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.300> argue

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
crown was facing lingual some will argue

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.800 
crown was facing lingual some will argue
that<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> CB<00:02:32.490> CT<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.450> again

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
that you can take a CB CT here but again

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290 
that you can take a CB CT here but again
that's<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.610> discussion<00:02:35.610> point<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.060> another

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that's a discussion point for another

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's a discussion point for another
video<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.630> again<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.810> distal<00:02:40.200> bone

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
video I think so again the distal bone

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.830 
video I think so again the distal bone
was<00:02:40.739> what<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.610> most<00:02:42.180> likely<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> be

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
was what was most likely going to be

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.979 
was what was most likely going to be
impacting<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.620> tooth<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:45.330> was<00:02:45.540> exactly

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
impacting this tooth and it was exactly

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.479 
impacting this tooth and it was exactly
what<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> I'll<00:02:46.800> come<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
what it is and I'll come back to this a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.720 
what it is and I'll come back to this a
little<00:02:47.640> bit<00:02:47.880> later<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.540> where<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
little bit later so that is where the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.880 
little bit later so that is where the
tooth<00:02:53.970> will<00:02:54.150> most<00:02:54.390> likely<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.930> impacting<00:02:55.680> when

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
tooth will most likely be impacting when

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
tooth will most likely be impacting when
you're<00:02:56.010> trying<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you're trying to take it out and if you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.160 
you're trying to take it out and if you
notice<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.080> well<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.400> nerve<00:02:59.640> is<00:03:00.030> very<00:03:00.840> close

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
notice as well the nerve is very close

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.720 
notice as well the nerve is very close
and<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> problems<00:03:02.550> with

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and this is one of the problems with

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
and this is one of the problems with
these<00:03:02.880> two<00:03:03.060> angular's<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.739> bone

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
these two angular's is that the bone

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.750 
these two angular's is that the bone
that<00:03:05.519> is<00:03:05.900> most<00:03:06.900> likely<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.980> impacting<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that is most likely to be impacting the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720 
that is most likely to be impacting the
tooth<00:03:09.090> from<00:03:09.300> coming<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.250> very<00:03:11.250> often<00:03:11.489> very

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
tooth from coming out is very often very

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.030 
tooth from coming out is very often very
close<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> canal<00:03:13.019> again<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.830> argue

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
close to the canal again you can argue

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.270 
close to the canal again you can argue
that<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:15.030> an<00:03:15.150> CB<00:03:15.900> CT<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.739> find<00:03:16.980> exactly

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that with an CB CT you can find exactly

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.069 
that with an CB CT you can find exactly
where<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.700> where<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.329> nervous<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:18.930> you

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
where the where the nervous but you

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.990 
where the where the nervous but you
don't<00:03:19.230> always<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.739> luxury<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.310> CB<00:03:20.640> CT

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
don't always have the luxury of a CB CT

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.640 
don't always have the luxury of a CB CT
and<00:03:21.180> sometimes<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.720> patients<00:03:22.110> can't<00:03:22.380> afford

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
and sometimes the patients can't afford

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.340 
and sometimes the patients can't afford
that<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.970> our<00:03:24.090> case<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.720> what<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:24.959> had

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
that so in our case that's what we had

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.250 
that so in our case that's what we had
to<00:03:25.530> work<00:03:25.709> with<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.150> see<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.810> even

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
to work with but you can see that even

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
to work with but you can see that even
with<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> CB<00:03:28.890> CT<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.549> my<00:03:29.730> surgical<00:03:30.090> plan

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
with the CB CT that my surgical plan

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.080 
with the CB CT that my surgical plan
doesn't<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.350> change<00:03:31.440> hell<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.280> lot<00:03:32.459> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
doesn't really change hell of a lot so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.370 
doesn't really change hell of a lot so
um<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.320> case<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.769> didn't<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.459> that

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
um so in this case we didn't go for that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.890 
um so in this case we didn't go for that
so<00:03:37.380> coming<00:03:38.190> back<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.670> destroyer<00:03:39.090> we

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
so coming back to this destroyer we

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.520 
so coming back to this destroyer we
first<00:03:40.200> had<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:42.060> tooth<00:03:42.360> will<00:03:42.690> most<00:03:42.930> likely<00:03:43.110> go

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
first had this tooth will most likely go

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.020 
first had this tooth will most likely go
out<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:44.070> way<00:03:44.340> okay<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:47.030> you're

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
out this way okay now because you're

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.840 
out this way okay now because you're
trying<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.540> remove<00:03:48.840> distal<00:03:49.290> bone<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.700> know

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
trying to remove distal bone so you know

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.640 
trying to remove distal bone so you know
you<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.120> want<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.600> remove<00:03:51.870> more<00:03:52.079> distal<00:03:52.470> bone

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
you you want to remove more distal bone

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.890 
you you want to remove more distal bone
because<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.820> want<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.420> tooth<00:03:54.660> come

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
because you want to have this tooth come

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.949 
because you want to have this tooth come
out<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.670> lot<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> times<00:03:57.150> what<00:03:57.420> happens<00:03:57.600> is

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
out a lot of the times what happens is

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.539 
out a lot of the times what happens is
that<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.410> remove<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.010> bone<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.489> this

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
that you remove the bone like this

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.990 
that you remove the bone like this
because<00:04:00.360> you'll<00:04:00.570> because<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:02.190> molar<00:04:02.700> is

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
because you'll because the the molar is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.960 
because you'll because the the molar is
so<00:04:03.180> far<00:04:03.420> back<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.130> you're<00:04:05.130> removing<00:04:05.459> bone<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
so far back and you're removing bone and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
so far back and you're removing bone and
you<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.630> sort<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.200> remove<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.620> bone<00:04:07.799> like

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
you and you sort of remove the bone like

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.080 
you and you sort of remove the bone like
this<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.519> what<00:04:08.670> happens<00:04:08.910> with<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.720> it

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
this and what happens with that is it

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.509 
this and what happens with that is it
you<00:04:12.090> don't<00:04:12.269> touch<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.720> part<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:14.370> is

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
you don't touch this part and this is

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.509 
you don't touch this part and this is
the<00:04:14.640> remaining<00:04:15.150> bone<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.840> sometimes<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.950> lot

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
the remaining bone that sometimes a lot

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.779 
the remaining bone that sometimes a lot
of<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> times<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.239> remove<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.690> bone<00:04:18.900> that

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
of the times if you remove the bone that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.409 
of the times if you remove the bone that
remains<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.269> therefore<00:04:21.959> all<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.550> bone<00:04:23.849> here

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
remains and therefore all this bone here

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.930 
remains and therefore all this bone here
is<00:04:24.599> what's<00:04:25.440> going<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> still<00:04:26.010> be<00:04:26.039> impacting

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
is what's going to still be impacting

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.230 
is what's going to still be impacting
the<00:04:27.060> two

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the two

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.540 
the two
even<00:04:27.599> you<00:04:27.750> try<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.110> elevate<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:29.069> not<00:04:29.340> going<00:04:29.490> to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
even you try and elevate is not going to

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.950 
even you try and elevate is not going to
go<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.849> you<00:04:29.970> think<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.419> remove<00:04:30.720> bone

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
go and you think that you remove bone

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.950 
go and you think that you remove bone
but<00:04:31.199> all<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:32.099> bone<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.789> still<00:04:33.660> hidden

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
but all that bone is still hidden

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.860 
but all that bone is still hidden
underneath<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.740> crown<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:35.750> stopping<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
underneath that crown and stopping the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050 
underneath that crown and stopping the
tooth<00:04:37.050> from<00:04:37.259> being<00:04:37.500> elevated<00:04:37.770> out<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.430> that's

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
tooth from being elevated out and that's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.860 
tooth from being elevated out and that's
why<00:04:39.270> oblique<00:04:39.840> section<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.680> useful<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.660> to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
why oblique section is useful to get to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.770 
why oblique section is useful to get to
this<00:04:43.080> blue<00:04:43.470> portion<00:04:43.800> here<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:45.210> remove<00:04:45.569> the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
this blue portion here and to remove the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.689 
this blue portion here and to remove the
bone<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.289> that's<00:04:46.530> really<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.400> main

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
bone so that's really one of the main

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.089 
bone so that's really one of the main
reasons<00:04:48.270> why<00:04:48.419> distal<00:04:48.870> angular<00:04:49.199> teeth<00:04:49.410> it's

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
reasons why distal angular teeth it's

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.070 
reasons why distal angular teeth it's
just<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.550> tricky<00:04:50.849> because<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.479> bone<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.930> you

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
just so tricky because the bone that you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.189 
just so tricky because the bone that you
need<00:04:52.319> to<00:04:52.500> remove<00:04:52.919> is<00:04:53.220> hidden<00:04:54.120> underneath<00:04:54.690> that

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
need to remove is hidden underneath that

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.460 
need to remove is hidden underneath that
crown<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.330> again<00:04:57.330> that's<00:04:57.569> why<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.990> lot<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.380> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
crown and again that's why a lot of the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.040 
crown and again that's why a lot of the
times<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.520> oblique<00:04:59.880> section<00:05:00.240> works<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:00.840> I

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
times the oblique section works and I

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.740 
times the oblique section works and I
can<00:05:01.199> tell<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.909> has<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.419> has<00:05:03.569> gotten

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
can tell you that it has it has gotten

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.620 
can tell you that it has it has gotten
me<00:05:03.960> out<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.139> a<00:05:04.319> jam<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> lot<00:05:04.919> of<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.130> times<00:05:05.630> so

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
me out of a jam a lot of the times so

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.480 
me out of a jam a lot of the times so
that's<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.139> oblique<00:05:07.500> section<00:05:07.949> there<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.340> you

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
that's the oblique section there and you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.200 
that's the oblique section there and you
can<00:05:08.639> see<00:05:08.789> if<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.120> section<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.900> nicely<00:05:10.409> that

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
can see if you section it nicely that

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.180 
can see if you section it nicely that
distal<00:05:12.210> crown<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.409> a<00:05:13.620> little<00:05:13.919> bit<00:05:14.009> of<00:05:14.099> the

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
distal crown and a little bit of the

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.390 
distal crown and a little bit of the
root<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.789> be<00:05:15.090> removed<00:05:15.509> and<00:05:16.099> it's<00:05:17.099> not<00:05:17.280> going

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
root can be removed and it's not going

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.620 
root can be removed and it's not going
to<00:05:17.490> be<00:05:17.580> wedge<00:05:17.849> as<00:05:18.120> well<00:05:18.389> because<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.349> tram<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
to be wedge as well because the tram the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.969 
to be wedge as well because the tram the
inferior<00:05:21.630> part<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.080> section<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.620> smaller

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
inferior part of the section is smaller

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.370 
inferior part of the section is smaller
than<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.280> superior<00:05:23.759> part<00:05:23.909> so<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.240> should<00:05:24.569> come

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
than the superior part so it should come

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.649 
than the superior part so it should come
out<00:05:25.590> nicely<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:26.460> get<00:05:26.729> access<00:05:26.970> into<00:05:27.539> that

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
out nicely and you get access into that

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.379 
out nicely and you get access into that
distal<00:05:28.139> part<00:05:28.409> of<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.770> tooth<00:05:29.340> for<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.180> to

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
distal part of the tooth for you to

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.800 
distal part of the tooth for you to
remove<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:32.490> coming<00:05:32.880> back<00:05:32.909> to<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.360> tooth<00:05:33.659> and

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
remove so coming back to this tooth and

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.439 
remove so coming back to this tooth and
this<00:05:34.199> is<00:05:34.380> what<00:05:34.560> exactly<00:05:34.729> happened<00:05:35.729> well<00:05:36.419> I

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
this is what exactly happened well I

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.110 
this is what exactly happened well I
opened<00:05:37.169> it<00:05:37.500> up<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:38.130> realized<00:05:38.699> that<00:05:38.909> this

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
opened it up and I realized that this

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.439 
opened it up and I realized that this
tooth<00:05:39.389> was<00:05:39.419> actually<00:05:40.139> facing<00:05:41.009> lingually<00:05:41.969> so<00:05:42.419> I

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
tooth was actually facing lingually so I

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.469 
tooth was actually facing lingually so I
was<00:05:42.870> thinking<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.320> myself<00:05:43.349> right<00:05:44.009> okay<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.759> he

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
was thinking to myself right okay and he

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.390 
was thinking to myself right okay and he
actually<00:05:45.780> looked<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.139> bit<00:05:46.169> distal<00:05:46.800> angular<00:05:47.250> as

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
actually looked a bit distal angular as

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.870 
actually looked a bit distal angular as
well<00:05:47.610> when<00:05:47.849> I<00:05:47.880> was<00:05:48.030> in<00:05:48.090> there<00:05:48.449> so<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.830> went<00:05:50.669> for

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
well when I was in there so I went for

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.260 
well when I was in there so I went for
the<00:05:50.969> oblique<00:05:51.330> section<00:05:51.780> like<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.229> and

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
the oblique section like this and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.379 
the oblique section like this and
therefore<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.810> also<00:05:55.789> maintained<00:05:56.789> my<00:05:56.969> mesial

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
therefore it also maintained my mesial

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.779 
therefore it also maintained my mesial
application<00:05:58.020> point<00:05:58.289> and<00:05:58.560> that<00:05:59.400> was<00:05:59.580> exactly

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
application point and that was exactly

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.939 
application point and that was exactly
what<00:06:00.300> happened<00:06:00.509> and<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:01.110> this<00:06:01.680> tooth

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
what happened and this this tooth

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.230 
what happened and this this tooth
actually<00:06:02.370> came<00:06:02.610> out<00:06:03.259> perfectly<00:06:04.259> and<00:06:05.240> elevated

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
actually came out perfectly and elevated

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.870 
actually came out perfectly and elevated
out<00:06:06.360> just<00:06:06.810> like<00:06:06.990> that<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:08.430> was<00:06:08.580> great

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
out just like that and it was great

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.700 
out just like that and it was great
because<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.389> actually<00:06:09.539> didn't<00:06:10.050> remove<00:06:10.319> a<00:06:10.500> lot

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
because I actually didn't remove a lot

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.339 
because I actually didn't remove a lot
of<00:06:10.800> distal<00:06:11.099> bone<00:06:11.250> at<00:06:11.460> all<00:06:11.870> because<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:12.900> knew<00:06:13.199> the

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
of distal bone at all because I knew the

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.980 
of distal bone at all because I knew the
nerve<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.919> potentially<00:06:14.520> very<00:06:14.729> close<00:06:15.030> so<00:06:15.659> I

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
nerve is potentially very close so I

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.230 
nerve is potentially very close so I
sectioned<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.099> tooth<00:06:17.310> just<00:06:17.550> like<00:06:17.759> that<00:06:18.000> I

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
sectioned the tooth just like that I

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.260 
sectioned the tooth just like that I
kept<00:06:18.870> my<00:06:19.050> Bell<00:06:19.380> all<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.919> way<00:06:20.039> in<00:06:20.400> within<00:06:21.120> the

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
kept my Bell all the way in within the

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.399 
kept my Bell all the way in within the
tooth<00:06:21.449> structure<00:06:21.780> and<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.229> tooth

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
tooth structure and and and the tooth

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.899 
tooth structure and and and the tooth
elevated<00:06:25.979> out<00:06:26.069> beautifully<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:26.729> that's

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
elevated out beautifully so that's

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.999 
elevated out beautifully so that's
that's<00:06:27.120> great<00:06:27.389> news<00:06:27.719> for<00:06:27.780> me<00:06:28.139> there<00:06:28.409> but<00:06:28.860> it

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
that's great news for me there but it

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.520 
that's great news for me there but it
doesn't<00:06:29.280> always<00:06:29.460> happen<00:06:29.849> perfectly<00:06:30.419> and<00:06:30.990> you

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
doesn't always happen perfectly and you

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.080 
doesn't always happen perfectly and you
need<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:31.889> be<00:06:32.009> able<00:06:32.159> to<00:06:32.340> know<00:06:32.610> how<00:06:32.789> to<00:06:32.819> get

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
need to be able to know how to get

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.450 
need to be able to know how to get
yourself<00:06:33.210> out<00:06:33.569> of<00:06:33.719> the<00:06:33.810> jam<00:06:34.110> so<00:06:34.919> in<00:06:35.159> closing

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
yourself out of the jam so in closing

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.760 
yourself out of the jam so in closing
some<00:06:36.300> important<00:06:36.839> points<00:06:37.169> with<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.409> distal

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
some important points with the distal

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.119 
some important points with the distal
angular<00:06:38.219> is<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.789> that<00:06:39.719> distal<00:06:40.199> bone<00:06:40.469> is

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
angular is that that distal bone is

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.459 
angular is that that distal bone is
not<00:06:41.309> always<00:06:41.909> accessible<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:42.869> a<00:06:43.110> lot<00:06:43.289> of<00:06:43.319> the

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
not always accessible and a lot of the

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.079 
not always accessible and a lot of the
times<00:06:43.649> it's<00:06:43.800> not<00:06:43.889> accessible<00:06:44.369> mainly<00:06:44.909> because

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
times it's not accessible mainly because

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.619 
times it's not accessible mainly because
the<00:06:45.809> crown<00:06:46.110> is<00:06:46.349> in<00:06:46.499> the<00:06:46.619> way<00:06:46.800> or<00:06:47.330> maybe<00:06:48.330> your

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
the crown is in the way or maybe your

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.239 
the crown is in the way or maybe your
surgical<00:06:48.959> access<00:06:49.529> is<00:06:49.739> not<00:06:50.099> ideal<00:06:50.819> and

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
surgical access is not ideal and

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.189 
surgical access is not ideal and
sometimes<00:06:53.249> when<00:06:53.729> you<00:06:53.849> repeat<00:06:54.239> what<00:06:54.719> you<00:06:54.749> think

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
sometimes when you repeat what you think

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.169 
sometimes when you repeat what you think
is<00:06:55.379> removing<00:06:55.860> distal<00:06:56.159> bone<00:06:56.339> you<00:06:56.849> end<00:06:57.059> up

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:57.179 
is removing distal bone you end up

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:59.959 
is removing distal bone you end up
creating<00:06:57.479> that<00:06:57.779> shelf<00:06:58.229> and<00:06:58.439> and<00:06:59.039> that<00:06:59.550> even

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
creating that shelf and and that even

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.639 
creating that shelf and and that even
though<00:07:00.149> you<00:07:00.209> remove<00:07:00.719> you<00:07:00.929> think<00:07:01.169> you<00:07:01.259> remove<00:07:01.559> a

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:01.649 
though you remove you think you remove a

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.279 
though you remove you think you remove a
lot<00:07:01.800> of<00:07:01.919> bone<00:07:02.099> you<00:07:02.429> you<00:07:03.330> haven't<00:07:03.749> removed<00:07:03.989> the

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
lot of bone you you haven't removed the

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.519 
lot of bone you you haven't removed the
bone<00:07:04.949> that<00:07:05.249> is<00:07:05.459> what<00:07:05.849> needs<00:07:06.089> to<00:07:06.330> be<00:07:06.569> removed<00:07:06.899> so

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:07.529 
bone that is what needs to be removed so

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.949 
bone that is what needs to be removed so
you<00:07:07.979> end<00:07:08.759> up<00:07:08.879> not<00:07:08.999> getting<00:07:09.269> anywhere<00:07:09.569> and<00:07:09.809> you

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:09.959 
you end up not getting anywhere and you

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.139 
you end up not getting anywhere and you
end<00:07:10.139> up<00:07:10.199> taking<00:07:10.589> away<00:07:10.739> more<00:07:11.610> bone<00:07:11.849> that<00:07:11.999> you

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:12.149 
end up taking away more bone that you

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.139 
end up taking away more bone that you
need<00:07:12.330> to<00:07:13.099> but<00:07:14.099> you<00:07:14.309> need<00:07:14.519> to<00:07:14.610> maintain<00:07:14.789> that

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:15.149 
need to but you need to maintain that

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:16.699 
need to but you need to maintain that

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 
principle of taking teeth are all about

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.379 
principle of taking teeth are all about
space<00:07:33.029> creation<00:07:33.479> and<00:07:34.639> creating<00:07:35.639> a<00:07:35.759> path<00:07:35.999> for

that tooth to be elevated out and really

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.459 
that tooth to be elevated out and really

you need to be able to assess the

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:46.999 
you need to be able to assess the

exactly the same and I've been caught

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.799 
exactly the same and I've been caught
out<00:07:50.519> before<00:07:50.969> where<00:07:51.209> I<00:07:51.240> thought<00:07:51.479> oh<00:07:51.629> yeah

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:51.809 
out before where I thought oh yeah

political a vertical impacted to come be
that<00:07:55.229> hard<00:07:55.499> but<00:07:55.860> it<00:07:56.189> ended<00:07:56.550> up<00:07:56.669> to<00:07:56.879> be<00:07:57.029> a<00:07:57.329> very

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:00.629 
difficult thing and when when verticals

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:02.299 
difficult thing and when when verticals
are<00:08:00.779> giving<00:08:01.110> you<00:08:01.259> a<00:08:01.289> problem<00:08:01.619> that<00:08:01.949> oblique
