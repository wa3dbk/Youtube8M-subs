00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
circles on the map and you can only

evolved<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.789> remake<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
evolved is actually just a remake of the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
evolved is actually just a remake of the
original<00:01:00.960> except<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> has<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> new

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
original except now it has the new

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
original except now it has the new
multipliers<00:01:03.290> pacifism<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.619> actually

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
multipliers pacifism is actually

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.590 
multipliers pacifism is actually
probably<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> best<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.180> games<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
probably the best of the new games that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
probably the best of the new games that
you're<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:06.869> find<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.950> doesn't

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you're gonna find and this one doesn't

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
you're gonna find and this one doesn't
give<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> any<00:01:08.610> guns<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.390> only<00:01:09.750> way

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
give you any guns at all your only way

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
give you any guns at all your only way
to<00:01:09.930> destroy<00:01:10.229> enemies<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.010> passing<00:01:11.369> through

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

a<00:01:11.549> bunch<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> gates<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.720> gets<00:01:12.840> really

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a bunch of gates and it gets really

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
a bunch of gates and it gets really
crazy<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.590> there's<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.040> tons<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
way through the end while earning as

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
way through the end while earning as
many<00:01:37.860> points<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.280> possible<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> other

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
many points as possible now the other

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
many points as possible now the other
big<00:01:40.049> addition<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.189> series<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.850> co-op

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
big addition to this series is co-op

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
big addition to this series is co-op
mode<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.009> play<00:01:44.189> both

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
mode so now you can play both

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.270 
mode so now you can play both
cooperatively<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.360> competitively<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.770> only

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
cooperatively or competitively the only

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
cooperatively or competitively the only
downside<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.420> offline

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
downside of this is that it's offline

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
downside of this is that it's offline
only<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.409> only<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> same<00:01:50.159> Xbox<00:01:50.610> 360<00:01:51.149> no

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
only it's only on the same Xbox 360 no

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.649 
only it's only on the same Xbox 360 no
online<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.829> complete<00:01:53.610> waste

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
online at all which is a complete waste

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.880 
online at all which is a complete waste
but<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.780> still<00:01:54.930> fun<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.530> play

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
but it's still fun to actually play

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.560 
but it's still fun to actually play
together<00:01:56.040> either<00:01:56.399> helping<00:01:56.880> each<00:01:57.000> other<00:01:57.119> score

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and sharing the same multiplier or just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.100 
and sharing the same multiplier or just
competing<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.270> space<00:02:00.600> trying<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
not quite the revolutionary experience

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
not quite the revolutionary experience
that<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.709> when<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.580> first<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:12.060> came<00:02:12.330> out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
the last few years it would have been

the last few years it would have been
nice<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.599> bit<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:21.930> come<00:02:22.170> out
