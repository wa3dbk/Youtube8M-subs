that<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.530> not<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.340> same<00:02:30.580> rucksack<00:02:31.360> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that this is not the same rucksack that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.030 
that this is not the same rucksack that
one<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.650> black<00:02:33.270> with<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.300> white<00:02:34.420> trim<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.470> this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
one is black with a white trim and this

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
one is black with a white trim and this
one<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.460> white<00:02:36.730> with<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> black<00:02:37.480> trim<00:02:37.960> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
one is white with a black trim and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.800 
one is white with a black trim and
there's<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.430> very<00:02:39.640> big<00:02:39.760> difference<00:02:40.510> in

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
there's a very big difference in

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
there's a very big difference in
everything<00:02:41.770> about<00:02:41.980> these<00:02:42.340> rucksacks<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.440> it's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
everything about these rucksacks so it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.260 
everything about these rucksacks so it's
quite<00:02:46.090> obvious<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:47.020> they<00:02:48.030> photoshopped<00:02:49.030> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
quite obvious that they photoshopped a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.220 
quite obvious that they photoshopped a
rucksack<00:02:49.600> onto<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.690> there's<00:02:53.020> more

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
rucksack onto this and there's more

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
rucksack onto this and there's more
evidence<00:02:53.410> as<00:02:53.920> well<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.700> go<00:02:54.910> into<00:02:55.390> this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
evidence as well if you go into this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.380 
evidence as well if you go into this
here<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.700> can<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.850> think<00:03:00.850> that's<00:03:01.060> as

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
here you can see the I think that's as

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
here you can see the I think that's as
if<00:03:01.810> here<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.560> white<00:03:03.220> lining<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
if here a white lining of the the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.410 
if here a white lining of the the
rucksack<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.850> goes<00:03:07.060> through<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:09.420> rail

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
rucksack and it goes through the rail

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.110 
rucksack and it goes through the rail
which<00:03:11.110> would<00:03:11.440> not<00:03:11.650> actually<00:03:12.310> happen<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
which would not actually happen in a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.830 
which would not actually happen in a
true<00:03:13.420> photo

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
true photo

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
true photo
I<00:03:13.930> don't<00:03:14.140> think<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.709> anyway<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.760> look<00:03:15.970> at

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
I don't think so anyway if you look at

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.949 
I don't think so anyway if you look at
this<00:03:16.360> here<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.140> see<00:03:17.709> evidence<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
this here you can see evidence of that

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.530 
this here you can see evidence of that
the<00:03:19.959> rail<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.620> much<00:03:20.980> smaller<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.360> going

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
the rail is much smaller and I'm going

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.390 
the rail is much smaller and I'm going
to<00:03:22.600> try<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:22.989> show<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.320> how<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.950> happens

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
to try and show you how that happens

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.250 
to try and show you how that happens
because<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:25.570> way<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:25.989> would<00:03:26.230> have

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
because the way they would have

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.550 
because the way they would have
photoshopped<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:28.570> would<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.840> put

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
photoshopped this they would have put

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.940 
photoshopped this they would have put
this<00:03:29.800> here<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:32.260> they<00:03:32.440> would<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.620> taken

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
this here and then they would have taken

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.240 
this here and then they would have taken
in<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.970> same<00:03:34.209> way<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.630> took<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.440> picture<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
in the same way as I took the picture of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.670 
in the same way as I took the picture of
the<00:03:36.459> rucksack<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.299> would<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.660> taken<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
the rucksack they would have taken the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.840 
the rucksack they would have taken the
leg<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.600> woman<00:03:41.080> here<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:42.549> leg

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
leg of the this woman here and the leg

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.460 
leg of the this woman here and the leg
of<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.510> woman<00:03:43.989> here<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.680> because<00:03:46.470> Photoshop

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
of this woman here and because Photoshop

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.430 
of this woman here and because Photoshop
is<00:03:47.739> based<00:03:48.160> on<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.700> layer<00:03:49.090> system<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
is based on a layer system so the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.280 
is based on a layer system so the
rucksack<00:03:51.040> would<00:03:51.310> be<00:03:51.459> at<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> back<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.870> two

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
rucksack would be at the back the two

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
rucksack would be at the back the two
legs<00:03:53.590> would<00:03:53.830> be<00:03:53.860> in<00:03:54.100> front<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.209> rucksack

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
legs would be in front of the rucksack

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.600 
legs would be in front of the rucksack
and<00:03:56.049> then<00:03:56.620> what<00:03:56.830> they<00:03:56.980> would<00:03:57.130> do<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.400> they

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
and then what they would do is they

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.180 
and then what they would do is they
would<00:03:57.640> clone<00:03:58.420> they<00:03:59.080> would<00:03:59.260> use<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.709> clone

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
would clone they would use the clone

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.039 
would clone they would use the clone
tool<00:04:00.820> in<00:04:01.360> order<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.959> clone<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.709> railings<00:04:03.220> now

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
tool in order to clone the railings now

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.500 
tool in order to clone the railings now
cloning<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.530> very<00:04:06.340> very<00:04:06.640> difficult<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:07.239> do<00:04:07.390> I'm

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
cloning is very very difficult to do I'm

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.710 
cloning is very very difficult to do I'm
going<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.780> try<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.230> show<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.720> can

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
going to try and show you that you can

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.640 
going to try and show you that you can
see<00:04:10.989> here<00:04:11.290> how<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.360> rail<00:04:13.360> becomes<00:04:14.080> much<00:04:14.380> much

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
see here how the rail becomes much much

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.949 
see here how the rail becomes much much
narrower<00:04:15.250> if<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.060> look<00:04:16.209> at<00:04:16.330> these<00:04:16.510> rails

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
narrower if you look at these rails

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.870 
narrower if you look at these rails
they're<00:04:17.440> straight

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.290 

the<00:04:21.330> problem<00:04:21.990> is<00:04:22.140> that<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.830> clone<00:04:23.430> it's

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the problem is that when you clone it's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.060 
the problem is that when you clone it's
quite<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> clever<00:04:25.700> -<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.930> can<00:04:28.170> see<00:04:28.530> signs

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
quite a clever - but you can see signs

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.960 
quite a clever - but you can see signs
of<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.850> at<00:04:30.570> least<00:04:30.990> when<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.980> can<00:04:32.280> I'm

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
of it at least when I do it you can I'm

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.690 
of it at least when I do it you can I'm
not<00:04:33.240> claiming<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> Photoshop<00:04:34.590> expert<00:04:34.830> by

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
not claiming to be a Photoshop expert by

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.270 
not claiming to be a Photoshop expert by
the<00:04:35.760> way<00:04:36.050> I'm<00:04:37.050> sure<00:04:37.320> there<00:04:37.560> are<00:04:37.650> people<00:04:37.830> who

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
the way I'm sure there are people who

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.240 
the way I'm sure there are people who
are<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:39.780> know<00:04:39.810> more<00:04:40.290> knowledgeable<00:04:40.980> about

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
are you know more knowledgeable about

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.270 
are you know more knowledgeable about
Photoshop<00:04:41.700> than<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.240> am<00:04:42.480> but<00:04:43.200> this<00:04:43.710> is<00:04:44.010> how<00:04:44.250> I

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
Photoshop than I am but this is how I

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760 
Photoshop than I am but this is how I
would<00:04:44.850> do<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.060> certainly<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.110> think<00:04:46.440> that

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
would do it certainly and I think that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.480 
would do it certainly and I think that
people<00:04:47.670> who've<00:04:47.790> done<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.270> are<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.490> good

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
people who've done this are not as good

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.120 
people who've done this are not as good
as<00:04:50.670> I<00:04:50.850> am<00:04:51.000> at<00:04:51.330> Photoshop<00:04:52.080> they've<00:04:52.320> actually

can<00:06:23.720> you<00:06:23.840> see<00:06:24.080> I'll<00:06:25.010> do<00:06:25.250> this<00:06:25.400> one

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.620 

it's<00:06:32.040> very<00:06:32.370> difficult<00:06:32.880> to<00:06:33.090> keep<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.450> in<00:06:33.600> line

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
it's very difficult to keep it in line

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.350 
it's very difficult to keep it in line
and<00:06:34.290> there's<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.620> bit<00:06:34.770> of<00:06:34.800> leakage<00:06:35.460> of<00:06:35.670> color<00:06:36.000> as

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
and there's a bit of leakage of color as

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.620 
and there's a bit of leakage of color as
well<00:06:36.390> can<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.080> see<00:06:37.520> if<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.880> went<00:06:39.120> over<00:06:39.300> it

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
well can you see if I went over it

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.890 
well can you see if I went over it
enough<00:06:39.930> I<00:06:40.110> might<00:06:40.320> you<00:06:40.740> see<00:06:40.950> this<00:06:41.250> is<00:06:41.490> really

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
enough I might you see this is really

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.000 
enough I might you see this is really
badly<00:06:42.900> done<00:06:43.380> now<00:06:43.730> but<00:06:44.960> if<00:06:45.960> you<00:06:46.290> take<00:06:46.650> enough

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
badly done now but if you take enough

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.560 
badly done now but if you take enough
time<00:06:48.290> that's<00:06:49.290> if<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.740> could<00:06:50.520> clone<00:06:50.910> that<00:06:51.270> for

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
time that's if I could clone that for

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.870 
time that's if I could clone that for
example<00:06:52.200> you<00:06:53.160> can<00:06:53.370> see<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:53.640> effect<00:06:55.880> you

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
example you can see the effect you

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.000 
example you can see the effect you
really<00:06:57.300> need<00:06:57.480> a<00:06:57.510> lot<00:06:57.780> of<00:06:57.840> patience<00:06:58.500> to<00:06:58.680> do<00:06:58.890> it

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
really need a lot of patience to do it

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.550 
really need a lot of patience to do it
but<00:06:59.460> I<00:06:59.610> have<00:06:59.850> found<00:07:00.090> it<00:07:00.360> quite<00:07:00.510> difficult<00:07:00.630> to

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
but I have found it quite difficult to

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.730 
but I have found it quite difficult to
clone<00:07:01.860> railings<00:07:02.550> myself<00:07:03.180> and<00:07:03.570> so<00:07:04.260> I<00:07:04.290> know

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
clone railings myself and so I know

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.230 
clone railings myself and so I know
well<00:07:05.640> I<00:07:05.670> recognized<00:07:06.420> when<00:07:06.720> I<00:07:06.750> see<00:07:07.260> a

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.870 
well I recognized when I see a

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.530
