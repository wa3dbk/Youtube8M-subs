00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
really go over there I might still have

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.480 
really go over there I might still have
to<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.850> them<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:13.830> course<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to get them when I go of course I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.080 
to get them when I go of course I
thought<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:15.030> were<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:16.560> started<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.580> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
thought these were what started me with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.160 
thought these were what started me with
the<00:01:18.619> sixes<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.270> were<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> first<00:01:21.720> sixes

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the sixes so these were the first sixes

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.390 
the sixes so these were the first sixes
I<00:01:22.320> ever<00:01:22.560> got<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.330> love<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.750> ever<00:01:24.930> since

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I ever got and I love them ever since

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
I ever got and I love them ever since
he's<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.430> weird<00:01:26.850> loose<00:01:27.090> lease<00:01:27.330> though<00:01:27.720> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
he's your weird loose lease though but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.370 
he's your weird loose lease though but
uh<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.430> tell<00:01:29.880> these<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> kiddie

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
uh as you can tell these are the kiddie

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
uh as you can tell these are the kiddie
six<00:01:31.650> energies<00:01:34.369> got<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.520> reflected<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
six energies got their reflected and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
six energies got their reflected and
everything<00:01:36.659> these<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.320> old<00:01:37.500> though

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
everything these are really old though

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
everything these are really old though
so<00:01:38.250> they're<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:38.790> beat<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> probably

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so they're a little beat up and probably

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.170 
so they're a little beat up and probably
creased<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.899> got<00:01:43.049> these<00:01:44.180> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
creased a little but we got these and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.780 
creased a little but we got these and
obviously<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> original<00:01:46.680> box<00:01:46.920> because

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
obviously not the original box because

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.420 
obviously not the original box because
had<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> while

visions<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.610> these<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:14.790> probably

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
visions but I think these are probably

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.510 
visions but I think these are probably
one<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> my<00:02:16.290> favorites<00:02:16.800> these<00:02:17.040> are<00:02:17.100> really

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
one of my favorites these are really

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.990

I like the Minish colorway the MIT is
you<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.840> colorway<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.850> don't

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you know colorway with that but I don't

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.990 
you know colorway with that but I don't
know<00:02:26.910> why<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.870> like

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.640 
know why I just like this little like
it's<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> bunch<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.260> colors

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.420 
much I still got the extra pair of laces
with<00:04:24.009> it

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.689 

signature<00:04:27.430> still<00:04:27.699> in<00:04:27.849> there<00:04:29.639> these<00:04:30.639> are

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
like a flap of tongue and then it has

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.050 
like a flap of tongue and then it has
like<00:04:35.349> a<00:04:35.380> mesh<00:04:35.620> one<00:04:35.860> underneath<00:04:36.310> which<00:04:37.030> is

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
like a mesh one underneath which is

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.390 
like a mesh one underneath which is
different<00:04:37.630> from<00:04:37.960> all<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.010> other<00:04:41.039> all<00:04:42.039> the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
different from all of the other all the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.370 
different from all of the other all the
other<00:04:42.520> models<00:04:42.789> but<00:04:43.150> these<00:04:43.659> ones<00:04:43.930> also<00:04:44.169> have

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
other models but these ones also have

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.180 
other models but these ones also have
different<00:04:44.560> eyelids<00:04:45.039> too<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.440> also<00:04:47.949> there's

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
different eyelids too and also there's

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.939 
different eyelids too and also there's
not<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.430> switch<00:04:49.240> right<00:04:49.479> here<00:04:49.720> where<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.620> would

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
not a switch right here where that would

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.670 
not a switch right here where that would
be<00:04:50.979> on<00:04:51.220> every<00:04:52.090> other<00:04:52.180> model<00:04:52.599> but<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.500> has

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
be on every other model but and it has

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.629 
be on every other model but and it has
holes<00:04:53.949> I'll<00:04:54.880> show<00:04:55.060> you

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.199 

so<00:04:59.639> look<00:04:59.879> at<00:04:59.969> these<00:05:00.149> to<00:05:01.490> see<00:05:02.490> how<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.669> tongues

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:03.209 
so look at these to see how the tongues

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:08.540 
so look at these to see how the tongues
are<00:05:03.389> different<00:05:03.809> and<00:05:04.349> then<00:05:06.559> the<00:05:07.559> inside<00:05:07.949> are

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
are different and then the inside are

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.700 
are different and then the inside are
different

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.530 

and<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.520> obviously<00:05:14.940> like<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.300> mesh

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
and this is obviously like a mesh

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.490 
and this is obviously like a mesh
material<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:16.259> this<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.800> rubber<00:05:17.400> ish<00:05:17.759> type

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
material and this is a rubber ish type

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.020 
material and this is a rubber ish type
which<00:05:19.500> you'd<00:05:19.650> call<00:05:19.889> that<00:05:20.100> but<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:23.220> then<00:05:23.850> this

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
which you'd call that but and then this

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.650 
which you'd call that but and then this
is<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.270> course<00:05:24.690> different<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:27.000> tongue<00:05:27.270> is

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
is of course different to the tongue is

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:44.390 
is of course different to the tongue is
different<00:05:28.050> from<00:05:28.139> both<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.410> these<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:43.400> my

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
different from both of these so my

00:05:44.400 --> 00:06:07.640 
different from both of these so my
rotation<00:06:04.310> these<00:06:05.310> are<00:06:05.580> probably<00:06:05.970> my<00:06:06.650> main

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
rotation these are probably my main

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.230 
rotation these are probably my main
rotations<00:06:08.310> right<00:06:08.550> now<00:06:08.699> as<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:09.060> can<00:06:09.120> tell

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
rotations right now as you can tell

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:41.810

these<00:06:09.570> are<00:06:09.630> my<00:06:09.930> LeBron<00:06:38.360> 93<00:06:39.409> AJ<00:06:40.409> ones<00:06:40.820> that

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.310 
these are my LeBron 93 AJ ones that
you're<00:06:42.030> green<00:06:42.270> so<00:06:42.570> were<00:06:42.750> these<00:06:42.900> a<00:06:42.960> couple<00:06:43.139> of

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
you're green so were these a couple of

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.659
