this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.920> my<00:00:02.100> DVD<00:00:02.699> burner<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.360> it's<00:00:04.290> not

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
this is my DVD burner and it's not

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.010 
this is my DVD burner and it's not
reading<00:00:06.229> desks<00:00:07.229> and<00:00:07.439> it<00:00:07.589> won't<00:00:08.420> it<00:00:09.420> won't<00:00:09.630> burn

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
reading desks and it won't it won't burn

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.720 
reading desks and it won't it won't burn
desks<00:00:10.680> so<00:00:10.910> I<00:00:11.910> thought<00:00:12.590> I'd<00:00:13.590> make<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.890> video<00:00:14.340> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
desks so I thought I'd make a video of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.230 
desks so I thought I'd make a video of
me<00:00:15.720> taking<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.320> apart<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.130> cleaning<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
me taking it apart and cleaning the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.109 
me taking it apart and cleaning the
laser<00:00:18.589> because<00:00:19.589> I<00:00:19.769> think<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.910> that's

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
laser because I think that's all that's

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
laser because I think that's all that's
wrong<00:00:21.419> with<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:24.140> all<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.529> need<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
wrong with it and all you need is the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.570 
wrong with it and all you need is the
cotton<00:00:27.480> swab

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
cotton swab

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.819 
cotton swab
and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.060> screwdriver

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.150 

and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.640 

a<00:00:35.280> paperclip<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
a paperclip off you can see that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.010 
a paperclip off you can see that
paperclip<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.150> I<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
paperclip or not but I have a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.100 
paperclip or not but I have a
straightened<00:00:40.770> day<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> little

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
straightened day and I have a little

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
straightened day and I have a little
hook<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.920> end<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.520> won't<00:00:44.970> need<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
hook on one end you won't need that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
hook on one end you won't need that
little<00:00:45.840> hook<00:00:46.020> but

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.980 

you<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.530> need<00:00:49.830> this<00:00:50.130> because<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.450> have<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
you just need this because you have to

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.660 
you just need this because you have to
open<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:53.010> door

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
open the door

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
open the door
and<00:00:54.120> I've<00:00:54.330> already<00:00:55.610> disassembled<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> event

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and I've already disassembled this event

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.890 
and I've already disassembled this event
but<00:00:57.540> there's<00:00:58.140> four<00:00:58.500> screws<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.660> take<00:01:00.660> those

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
but there's four screws and take those

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.990 
but there's four screws and take those
four<00:01:01.320> screws<00:01:01.830> every<00:01:02.220> week<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.670> lift

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
four screws every week and just lift

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.890 
four screws every week and just lift
that<00:01:03.440> panel<00:01:04.440> off<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.750> little

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that panel off and just make it a little

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.990 
that panel off and just make it a little
simpler<00:01:07.470> I've<00:01:07.830> already<00:01:08.369> taken<00:01:09.119> off<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
simpler I've already taken off this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
simpler I've already taken off this
circuit<00:01:12.000> board<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.560> unlocked<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.220> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
circuit board and unlocked all but all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
circuit board and unlocked all but all
these<00:01:15.180> ribbon<00:01:15.690> cables

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
these ribbon cables

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.600 
these ribbon cables
just<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.210> lasers<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:21.990> here

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
just to get and the lasers right here

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
just to get and the lasers right here
but<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.759> can't<00:01:24.000> clean<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.020> side<00:01:25.350> we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
but we can't clean it from this side we

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.660 
but we can't clean it from this side we
have<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.009> take<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.729> whole<00:01:26.789> thing<00:01:27.360> out

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
have to take this whole thing out

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.399 
have to take this whole thing out
to<00:01:29.150> get<00:01:29.360> at<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.670> have<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.880> do<00:01:32.409> is

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
to get at it so what you have to do is

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.740 
to get at it so what you have to do is
you<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:33.710> open<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.250> door<00:01:34.460> first<00:01:34.880> there's<00:01:35.689> a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
you get open the door first there's a

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.710 
you get open the door first there's a
little<00:01:36.080> hole<00:01:36.290> right<00:01:36.320> there<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:38.479> might<00:01:38.659> be

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
little hole right there and it might be

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.440 
little hole right there and it might be
in<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.080> different<00:01:39.110> place<00:01:39.590> on<00:01:40.009> other<00:01:40.580> ones<00:01:41.030> but

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
in a different place on other ones but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.740 
in a different place on other ones but
that's<00:01:41.720> weird<00:01:42.280> that's<00:01:43.280> where<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.330> push

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that's weird that's where it is you push

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.960 
that's weird that's where it is you push
there<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.680> then<00:01:46.039> open<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.880> door<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.970> then

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
there and then open up the door and then

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.600 
there and then open up the door and then
you<00:01:50.450> should<00:01:50.690> be<00:01:50.960> able<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.320> take<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:51.920> base

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
you should be able to take this base

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.240 
you should be able to take this base
plate<00:01:52.640> off<00:01:59.110> you<00:02:00.110> probably<00:02:00.560> won't<00:02:00.770> have<00:02:00.979> to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
plate off you probably won't have to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.070 
plate off you probably won't have to
take<00:02:01.429> it<00:02:01.670> totally<00:02:01.880> off<00:02:02.390> gets<00:02:02.960> off<00:02:03.590> enough

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
take it totally off gets off enough

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.770 
take it totally off gets off enough
disconnected<00:02:06.080> from<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.500> shallow<00:02:06.770> sea<00:02:07.780> that's

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
disconnected from the shallow sea that's

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.210 
disconnected from the shallow sea that's
the<00:02:09.019> day<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:10.039> pull<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:10.850> off<00:02:11.360> like<00:02:11.959> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the day and just pull that off like that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.650 
the day and just pull that off like that
at<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.120> side

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.570 

put<00:02:21.810> down<00:02:22.080> here

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
put down here

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.390 
put down here
and<00:02:23.670> there's<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.420> laser<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.500 

I<00:02:29.459> always<00:02:30.209> take<00:02:30.689> mine<00:02:31.019> apart

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
I always take mine apart

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.760 
I always take mine apart
clean<00:02:34.110> them<00:02:34.349> by<00:02:34.560> hand<00:02:35.360> rubbing<00:02:36.360> alcohol

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.330 

I<00:02:42.890> have<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.610> rubbing<00:02:44.060> alcohol<00:02:44.920> stored<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.160> this

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340

and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.800> don't<00:03:07.920> need<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.250> lot<00:03:08.580> on<00:03:08.879> there

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.050 

this<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.340> kind<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.150> big<00:03:13.770> bottle<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.010> hard<00:03:15.730> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
this is kind of a big bottle so hard to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:26.670 
this is kind of a big bottle so hard to
give<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.170> anyway<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:18.930> lightly

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.990 

like<00:03:26.859> we<00:03:27.129> clean

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
like we clean

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.630 
like we clean
clean<00:03:29.510> laser

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.119 

probably<00:03:33.640> won't<00:03:33.790> notice<00:03:34.120> any<00:03:34.629> dirt<00:03:35.590> come<00:03:35.950> off

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
probably won't notice any dirt come off

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.280 
probably won't notice any dirt come off
litter

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
litter

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.070 
litter
or<00:03:37.769> anything<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.430> most<00:03:39.269> likely<00:03:39.569> there

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
or anything like that most likely there

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.100 
or anything like that most likely there
is<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.620> with<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.549> dry<00:03:41.849> side<00:03:42.799> just<00:03:43.799> dry<00:03:44.220> it

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
is and with the dry side just dry it

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.320 
is and with the dry side just dry it
and<00:03:46.590> I'm<00:03:46.740> gonna<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.430> couple<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.090> times

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and I'm gonna do this couple of times

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.890 
and I'm gonna do this couple of times
because<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.320> don't

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
because I don't

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.839 
because I don't
I<00:03:50.959> don't<00:03:51.650> want<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:52.010> have<00:03:52.159> to<00:03:52.370> take<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.790> part

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
I don't want to have to take this part

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.559 
I don't want to have to take this part
again<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:54.019> I'm<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.190 

I'm<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.080> going<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.439> try<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.799> twice<00:03:58.400> just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
I'm just going to try it twice just

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.300 
I'm just going to try it twice just
make<00:04:00.740> sure<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.400> it's

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:17.610 

clean

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.260 

and<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:18.419> DVD<00:04:19.419> burner<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.060> computer

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
and this DVD burner is to the computer

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.439 
and this DVD burner is to the computer
that<00:04:22.870> I'm<00:04:23.050> actually<00:04:23.410> using<00:04:23.740> right<00:04:24.460> now<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
that I'm actually using right now so I

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.969 
that I'm actually using right now so I
can't<00:04:26.910> can<00:04:27.910> actually<00:04:28.600> make<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.810> video<00:04:29.110> putting

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
can't can actually make a video putting

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:41.430 
can't can actually make a video putting
it<00:04:30.070> back<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.810> together<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.320> whatever<00:04:32.530> but

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:59.380 

you<00:04:41.710> can<00:04:41.920> see

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.620 

I<00:05:00.040> probably<00:05:01.040> didn't<00:05:01.490> have<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:01.850> take<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.330> off

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
I probably didn't have to take this off

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.430 
I probably didn't have to take this off
but<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.350> just<00:05:03.380> wanted<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.010> show

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
but I just wanted to show

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.570 
but I just wanted to show
the<00:05:05.770> laser<00:05:06.010> from<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.730> other<00:05:06.880> side<00:05:07.980> so<00:05:08.980> that's

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
the laser from the other side so that's

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.520 
the laser from the other side so that's
basically<00:05:10.120> all<00:05:10.240> there<00:05:10.420> is<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.320> just

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
basically all there is to and you just

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.940 
basically all there is to and you just
put<00:05:11.800> everything<00:05:11.920> back<00:05:12.550> together<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:14.320> won't

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
put everything back together and I won't

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.970 
put everything back together and I won't
Bob<00:05:15.660> showing<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.870> putting<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.590> back<00:05:17.740> together

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
Bob showing you putting it back together

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.000 
Bob showing you putting it back together
because<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:18.940> basically<00:05:19.450> just<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:20.680> reverse

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
because it's basically just the reverse

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.180 
because it's basically just the reverse
of<00:05:21.370> taking<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.180> apart<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:23.080> just<00:05:23.770> wanted<00:05:24.070> to

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
of taking it apart but I just wanted to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.060 
of taking it apart but I just wanted to
show<00:05:24.370> how<00:05:24.750> how<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.810> clean<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:27.900> laser<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.530> it's

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
show how how to clean the laser and it's

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.150 
show how how to clean the laser and it's
basically<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.880> same<00:05:30.910> for<00:05:31.540> any<00:05:31.920> anything<00:05:32.920> that

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
basically the same for any anything that

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.930 
basically the same for any anything that
has<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.580> drive<00:05:34.120> in<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.780> has<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:34.990> laser<00:05:35.350> so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
has a drive in it that has a laser so

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.550 
has a drive in it that has a laser so
most<00:05:36.940> things<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.390> don't<00:05:37.630> have<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.050> take<00:05:38.230> the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
most things you don't have to take the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.010 
most things you don't have to take the
drive<00:05:39.160> totally<00:05:40.150> apart

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
drive totally apart

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.440 
drive totally apart
but<00:05:42.560> anyway<00:05:42.919> that's<00:05:43.099> how<00:05:43.280> you

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
but anyway that's how you

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.400 
but anyway that's how you
cleaner

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410
