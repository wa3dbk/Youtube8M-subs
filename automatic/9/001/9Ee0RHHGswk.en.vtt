00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.600
 Tell people who was crazy for one more. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.460
 video this time again with prayer 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.130
 but not with party moods that in this 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 last video announcing the arrival of the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 game in the steam and yes in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.020
 sadness that two days later he went 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.430
 expelled from the same steam aleris and in the video 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.699
 and today I'm going to explain all this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.680
 controversy that is happening with game 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.590
 just right for those who are understanding why 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.289
 he was expelled from the extinct because he has 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.120
 So many angry people in the game and that's it. 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.760
 What am I going to do in this video here? 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 so I'll start at the beginning then 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.010
 everybody knows daisy right? 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 daisy is the modification to play more 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.770
 two that I assure you that the deviation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 and was responsible for the shipowner to sell 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 let's just say 10 and made the owners 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.780
 sell over a million copies ie 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.199
 sold almost more than the game in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 synthesis a modification to a game and 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 When did this happen to the crew? 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.049
 everyone likes to observe the kind that 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.619
 does not like a calypso unb 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.900
 dangerously 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.060
 besides facing zombies also the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 humans do not know who their friends are or 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 enemies and people want to get their 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 bullets your weapons 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.549
 their food to survive because 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 you have to survive is not that the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.290
 The purpose of the game is to be 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.049
 other people or not and when 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.549
 This happened the butt for 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.159
 at the beginning of the year everyone playing 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.259
 I wish the caramba type of a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 mechanically waged a modification is a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.890
 own game of a mechanic caught 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.900
 imagine locked but functional 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.230
 vehicle everything 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.340
 IAA was then end where it enters the hummer 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.420
 point that the varzim developer 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.480
 occurs with everyone playing this 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.640
 business then last idea and they 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.550
 they picked up to announce a game of them warzee 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 You know now I fought. 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.270
 microphone is then when she announced the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.390
 game she had no project had not 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.670
 nothing about playing or not is not easy a 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 game out in the face already promised a million 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.610
 of things in the game and had not even started 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.680
 I did not know, there was no effect 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.980
 league game logo 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.140
 And that's when they started them. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.350
 was developing a game side of them 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 I do not know the name of their game and they 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.910
 instead they abandoned it 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.610
 start developing az 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.980
 it was an expanded idea in their heads 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.410
 Who adapted this game? 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.510
 the post apocalyptic style sumbe neckel 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.350
 12 and it was where the whole problem started 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.050
 because it is an adaptation type 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.239
 guys did not even henze it 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.500
 a game alone 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.350
 and there started all kinds of graphics are 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.459
 ugly graphics are not good regime is 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 locked 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.860
 the game is heavy type of a million 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 things they promised they did not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.570
 gave no energy percent 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.680
 committed a huge and a war z map 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.370
 small 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.250
 the second half hour getting whole 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:31.130
 through a huge dave map in the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 time and promise 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:40.280
 the use of cpu to improve you especially the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.380
 your character the bastard 4 and went and went 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.480
 in this medium of pvicos also 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.170
 supply begins and ends up already 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.410
 which they promised and second to 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.150
 further aggravating the situation is to 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.420
 put the image to you 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.910
 he was accused of copying the images of the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.860
 serial the walking dead had them 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.280
 took gone show only give a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.530
 modified liacc and played in the game tá 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.290
 so connected in the pictures 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.680
 to make matters worse 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.950
 and if you think it was bad then 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.770
 Calm down when the users were 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.740
 Report problem these things 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.200
 the game was very early 2001 makes 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.720
 an endless spout looks to deliver but there 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.930
 but the environment gets difficult 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.790
 It's too much for me to fill the people who 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.660
 the report the problem outside the support 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.630
 the mania of the players' bathrooms there 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.040
 also had the rumors of 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.930
 that he was there is no player who 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 played enough to be able to keep the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.530
 new post in a virtual store that 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.720
 happened kokkalis unb you buy in 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.610
 virtual store of the game and it is ready 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.980
 for the end of the world is also and beyond 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:08.020
 banias ban the players all business 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:10.360
 there and so he decided to remove the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.100
 game from there 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.440
 precisely because of this they said that it was 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:23.390
 early his direction is 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:30.110
 happening promised the best game of the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:33.140
 world and made the worst game is ruizinho é 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.120
 Talk to you, but it's fun for you. 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.180
 play with a friend 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.370
 pays for 20 reais, which is what I 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.230
 I paid I think it pays 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.070
 now it 's 90 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:50.070
 so is more expensive there so take this 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.450
 and unfortunately they will not be able to 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.190
 to recover 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.820
 People, I guess I already said too much. 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.650
