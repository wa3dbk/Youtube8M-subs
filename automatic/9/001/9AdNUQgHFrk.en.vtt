stuff but I've noticed trading just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.300 
stuff but I've noticed trading just
tends<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> screw<00:01:16.560> over<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.830> own<00:01:16.920> team<00:01:17.130> or

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
tends to screw over your own team or

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179
