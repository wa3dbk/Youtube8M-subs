00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.469
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.600
 very well today I'm going to record 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.850
 a video about hair care 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.080
 because as you know I dye it so 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 Now I'm going up a little bit more 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.950
 of an eye with the things I use with 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.900
 so if you already treatments so that 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.279
 I hope it's short and we start with 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.390
 the truth the first thing that is obviously 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.910
 the shampoo because all the people 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.100
 normal and in my case I use a shampoo 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 anyone who is in the bathroom in that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.810
 be the hands I do not care 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.000
 If I know that I have to buy a shampoo 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.010
 intense result but I did not have the silver 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.899
 to buy it but I'm going to make it 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.069
 conditioner I'm using one of Ivan 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.069
 which is again is from the natural line and 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:43.010
 it's called network is pasta like academies 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.649
 only against its rich 30 ml written 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.039
 and delighted I'm going to leave a photo but 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.920
 honestly it has lasted me little or is there 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.299
 to use quite a lot if I leave it 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.249
 more or less like a cream 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.260
 treatment be about five minutes six 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.850
 minutes and then just in game leaves me 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.710
 the very soft hair very bright very 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 soft if everything leaves it heavy 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.250
 but it's short-lived so I've already done 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.619
 then almost two weeks and I'm going to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.440
 franc field and he always occupied it like this 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.440
 that I think it serves to finish it as 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.619
 treatment creams I have two the hydra 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.259
 and the macadamia king of the lines 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.530
 organics and this one that I bought from this 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:26.509
 later mine this one of 400 twins and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.420
 this brings 237 are going to give nothing and it's already 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.979
 well it's like half more or less and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.890
 Since I do not want to use it much I bought myself 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.770
 is spending is more than that then 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.390
 I do once a week or 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.610
 every two weeks or so is that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
 I mix these two in a post stage and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.650
 to mix a bit of this with this and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.230
 I also go 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.170
 I put one of the 6 macadamia of the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.540
 line today and it worked for me to suffer from 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 Yesterday I said it and said it as 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.310
 they passed now more less and alarming what 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.720
 I put the cream all over my hair 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.060
 only doctors contacted at the head 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.650
 he made me a tomato and I left it there as a 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.180
 hour or so and then biology 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.340
 rinse and I said this question is going to 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.500
 be horribly rough or a fact 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.290
 shampoo side all and something told me no 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.790
 I was hoping it's going to be like that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.000
 I took out the conditioner all the creams 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.610
 Suddenly, it's great for me to bathe and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.950
 I'm going to bed the eclipses them and 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.260
 today men and simon peres and as full 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.870
 frizz and I said there this can be horrible 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.850
 I started combing it and it was very silky 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 very bright and very manageable 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.410
 good now and wind so obviously 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.030
 I know how you go but it was very very rich like that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 that I will at least follow 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 doing this combination because I know 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.760
 I happened to put this oil inside 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.830
 the ones from the treatment creams 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.500
 because right here he decides which way to use 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.150
 It can be a droplet as a serum or for 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.390
 strengthen the creams of treatments i 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.940
 I dont know 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.190
 the smell is about 4 this cost me 5 thousand 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.310
 950 and can buy it in commercial 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.480
 less at home so I pricked 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.950
 I recommend 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 although it never gets greasy as well 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.120
 I was filthy skin always left 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.100
 bright with a tuber so I'm 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200
 I have used it a lot apart from the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.300
 treatment creams like being in the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.820
 night in the morning when I go to 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.739
 comb what yes this always goes after 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.530
 of the dryer or after the iron 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.180
 because if you have medium wet hair 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
 and you put on iron I'm like 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.570
 I was suffering from telpago I'm not from 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.820
 customer so always the oils 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.709
 then how do you have to go after 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.000
 that some substitutes after knowing 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.010
 but it's good, I bought myself 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.709
 special that is like a protector of 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.120
 heat with vitamin particles that's 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.220
 when they have red particles 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.360
 there do not know if you can see then uses a 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.490
 couple times 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.220
 I do not know that he will also be like protector 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.410
 leave it because I do not get used to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.700
 ironed Armenian I laugh simply 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.770
 the brushes and I do not even take it 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.810
 with dryer I do not know that it will also work 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.900
 as a heat protector but I can say 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.030
 that it does not leave but as stiff 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.410
 and consistency is the one suddenly 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 think you can say what I think 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.470
 as I do not know what does not happen that leaves it 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.050
 Super handle and bright and leave a rich 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.440
 logo and this one has cost me three thousand 290 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.420
 it comes in the ezeiza magazines 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.180
 if I'm not wrong and as last things 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.640
 I'm using this 6-dry shampoo 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.380
 they are also that more than anything for 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.730
 roots when he supports us through the 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.919
 see I was a little pig that 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.690
 there takes me aside and has equally good 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.130
 using all these things as from 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.770
 treatment you have to keep your hair 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.419
 wash it constantly but for example 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.310
 throughout the day on Monday call you not 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.560
 side on Wednesday is already greasy 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.750
 for the same reason because I'm treating him 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.669
 that is more hydrated in that dry or 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.050
 I do not care if its partners and 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.670
 it leaves grease faster but that 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.960
 interesting to keep them 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.570
 hydrated by the subject of the waist and 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.250
 so that the tips do not damage that is 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.650
 my care my hair care and 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.530
 Well, I always use this topic, which is a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.240
 brush that is super soft does not have 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.470
 the hair and it does not hurt or anything like that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.490
 I recommend it and they last a long time 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.410
 so that 's what I liked the most 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.990
 this has been macadamia oil 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.070
 equal half almost pain of wadding 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.720
 from your house because you're written so 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.760
 tiny but it has worked for me 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.130
 pretty good and you get very rich dollar like that 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.380
 that if they have tried the possibility of 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.030
 try it I recommend it 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.790
 there is a small vial that attracts 10,000 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.920
 costs 3 possible do not want to try and not 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.320
 spend 6,000 on is that all call 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.120
 issues in it cost more expensive so 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.290
 that is a care minister of the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.290
 hair I hope you liked it 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:45.400
 there they see it is to speak that potato and this 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.590
 yoke and for her to be I have it but in 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.670
 acb 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.670
 and people look at me like 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.930
 the whole coast is in accordance with this 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.470
 cannes and the square and all the others the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.470
 giant flag 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.590
 and those girls I hope they are super 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.480
 well and with these port shots montt 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.160
