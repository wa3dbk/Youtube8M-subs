sports<00:05:28.789> in<00:05:31.970> my<00:05:32.970> career

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.530 

and<00:05:40.010> we<00:05:40.070> saw<00:05:40.280> possibly<00:05:40.790> minutes<00:05:41.090> of<00:05:41.270> why<00:05:41.480> the

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
and we saw possibly minutes of why the

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.580 
and we saw possibly minutes of why the
years<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:46.450> yeah<00:05:47.450> if<00:05:47.690> somebody<00:05:48.050> have<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.260> good

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
years and yeah if somebody have a good

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:56.190 
years and yeah if somebody have a good
idea<00:05:53.530> you<00:05:54.530> have<00:05:54.830> no<00:05:54.860> really<00:05:55.280> it's<00:05:55.400> more<00:05:55.670> like

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
idea you have no really it's more like

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.010 
idea you have no really it's more like
well<00:05:57.430> I<00:05:58.430> think<00:05:58.610> maybe<00:05:59.090> 10<00:05:59.420> years<00:05:59.570> ago<00:05:59.720> or

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
well I think maybe 10 years ago or

point<00:07:17.220> like<00:07:17.460> when<00:07:17.930> performing<00:07:18.930> and<00:07:19.740> that's

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
point like when performing and that's

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.590 
point like when performing and that's
sort<00:07:20.400> of<00:07:20.490> the<00:07:20.550> equivalent<00:07:20.760> of<00:07:21.270> when<00:07:21.450> the

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
sort of the equivalent of when the

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.600 
sort of the equivalent of when the
cameras<00:07:22.020> are<00:07:22.200> on

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610

that's quite a start I mean the way out

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.720 
that's quite a start I mean the way out
there's<00:07:33.300> things<00:07:33.810> that<00:07:33.930> happen<00:07:34.350> the<00:07:34.500> best<00:07:35.460> is
