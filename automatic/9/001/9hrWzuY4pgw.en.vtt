cuz garchomps are pretty physically
bulky<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.250> decided<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.759> mock<00:01:24.060> punch

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360

here but you just call that Garchomp for
I<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:31.829> idea<00:01:31.890> why<00:01:32.189> he<00:01:32.400> called<00:01:32.880> back

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I have no idea why he called back

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
I have no idea why he called back
Garchomp<00:01:33.600> doesn't<00:01:33.960> make<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.229> sense<00:01:34.380> to

the<00:02:50.930> ice<00:02:51.050> beam<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:55.460> was<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.610> pretty

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
the ice beam and it that was a pretty

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.330 
the ice beam and it that was a pretty
good<00:02:56.000> amount<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.390> damage<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> Zapdos<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:58.250> he

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
good amount of damage to Zapdos but he

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.300 
good amount of damage to Zapdos but he
