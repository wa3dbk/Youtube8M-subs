00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
twenty-four hundred megahertz am I don't

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.650 
think so hello welcome to opto prestech
today<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.790> gonna<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:09.059> showing<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.630> a

today we're gonna be showing you a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660 
today we're gonna be showing you a
little<00:00:10.110> video<00:00:10.380> here<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.889> shows<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
little video here that shows the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.530 
little video here that shows the
difference<00:00:11.969> between<00:00:12.679> 1600<00:00:13.679> megahertz<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.700> 24

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
difference between 1600 megahertz and 24

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.220

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
2400 mega her gran I'm 24 I get a lot of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.250 
2400 mega her gran I'm 24 I get a lot of
people<00:00:20.490> asking<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> lot<00:00:21.119> Co<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:22.050> there<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
people asking me a lot Co is there a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
people asking me a lot Co is there a
difference<00:00:22.590> between<00:00:22.650> 1600<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.519> 2400<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
difference between 1600 and 2400 and of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.019 
difference between 1600 and 2400 and of
course<00:00:24.660> everyone<00:00:25.140> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> always<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
course everyone kind of always just

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.509 
course everyone kind of always just
assumes<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.240> 24<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.260> faster<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
assumes that 24 is faster because the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.510 
assumes that 24 is faster because the
number<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.000> higher<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.830> may<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.070> true<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
number is higher and this may be true in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.080 
number is higher and this may be true in
memory<00:00:33.480> benchmarks<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.620> about<00:00:35.090> things

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
memory benchmarks but what about things

00:00:36.090 --> 00:01:21.760 
memory benchmarks but what about things
you<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.750> do

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.529 

so<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.039> can<00:01:23.190> see<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> numbers<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.299> on

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
so we can see from the numbers there on

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.139 
so we can see from the numbers there on
the<00:01:24.930> benchmark<00:01:25.830> numbers<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> charts<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
the benchmark numbers the charts you

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.499 
the benchmark numbers the charts you
were<00:01:27.590> shown<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.950> proof<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.490> available<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
were shown the proof is available in the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.430 
were shown the proof is available in the
description<00:01:31.020> I'll<00:01:31.110> upload<00:01:31.289> those<00:01:31.680> later

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
description I'll upload those later

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.770 
description I'll upload those later
they're<00:01:34.440> almost<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.220> same<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.539> 2,400<00:01:36.539> maybe

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they're almost the same the 2,400 maybe

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.850 
they're almost the same the 2,400 maybe
just<00:01:37.550> super<00:01:38.810> incrementally<00:01:39.810> better<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.649> mean

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
just super incrementally better I mean

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.809 
just super incrementally better I mean
like<00:01:41.330> if<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.509> ran<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> 1600<00:01:43.500> again<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.280> bet<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
like if I ran the 1600 again I bet it

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.309 
like if I ran the 1600 again I bet it
would<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.240> same<00:01:45.479> exact<00:01:45.840> score<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.289> the

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
would get the same exact score as the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.820 
would get the same exact score as the
2400<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.549> far<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.789> gaming<00:01:48.569> and<00:01:48.830> CPU

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
2400 so as far as gaming and CPU

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.399 
2400 so as far as gaming and CPU
benchmarking<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.789> really<00:01:51.479> haven't<00:01:51.869> seen<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
benchmarking I really haven't seen a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.680 
benchmarking I really haven't seen a
difference<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.490> most<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.970> us<00:01:54.090> only<00:01:54.270> game

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
difference and most of us only game

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.499 
difference and most of us only game
anyway<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.549> save<00:01:56.549> yourself<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:57.000> couple<00:01:57.209> bucks

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
anyway so save yourself a couple bucks

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.760 
anyway so save yourself a couple bucks
buy<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> slower<00:01:59.310> RAM<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.479> mean<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> don't<00:02:01.380> know

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
buy the slower RAM I mean I don't know

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
buy the slower RAM I mean I don't know
about<00:02:01.799> anything<00:02:02.429> below<00:02:02.580> 1600<00:02:03.330> price<00:02:04.319> said<00:02:04.560> he

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
about anything below 1600 price said he

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.740 
about anything below 1600 price said he
was<00:02:04.709> gonna<00:02:04.800> do<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> video<00:02:05.190> comparing<00:02:05.670> 1066<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
was gonna do a video comparing 1066 and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.890 
was gonna do a video comparing 1066 and
like<00:02:08.690> 2666<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.440> huge<00:02:10.800> jump<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
like 2666 so that's a huge jump it's a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.290 
like 2666 so that's a huge jump it's a
large<00:02:13.110> jump<00:02:13.379> from<00:02:13.530> 69<00:02:13.980> 2400<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.790> save<00:02:14.970> yourself

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
large jump from 69 2400 so save yourself

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.780 
large jump from 69 2400 so save yourself
a<00:02:15.390> couple<00:02:15.599> bucks<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.980> game<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
a couple bucks if all you do is game and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.270 
a couple bucks if all you do is game and
do<00:02:18.030> some<00:02:18.300> CPU<00:02:19.200> benchmarking<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.040> Ram

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
do some CPU benchmarking if Ram

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.449 
do some CPU benchmarking if Ram
benchmarking<00:02:20.910> isn't<00:02:21.180> very<00:02:21.330> important<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> you

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
benchmarking isn't very important to you

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.030
