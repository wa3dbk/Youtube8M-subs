and then we break it down how to achieve
the<00:01:44.360> look<00:01:44.479> exactly<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:45.170> products<00:01:45.740> when<00:01:46.369> to

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the look exactly what products when to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.880 
the look exactly what products when to
put<00:01:46.670> them<00:01:46.789> in<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.869> then<00:01:48.229> because<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.560> have<00:01:48.770> to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
put them in and then because you have to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.639 
put them in and then because you have to
have<00:01:49.009> 20<00:01:49.550> 25<00:01:50.090> girls<00:01:50.330> or<00:01:50.690> guys<00:01:50.869> look<00:01:51.140> exactly

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
have 20 25 girls or guys look exactly

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.499 
have 20 25 girls or guys look exactly
the<00:01:51.710> same<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.610> that's<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:52.940> hardest<00:01:53.240> part<00:01:53.360> of

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
the same so that's the hardest part of

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.020 
the same so that's the hardest part of
the<00:01:53.600> show<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.810> getting<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.319> consistency<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
the show is getting the consistency you

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.550 
the show is getting the consistency you
can't<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.360> one<00:01:56.390> girl<00:01:56.720> look<00:01:56.899> amazing<00:01:57.350> in<00:01:57.470> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
can't have one girl look amazing in the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.620 
can't have one girl look amazing in the
rest<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.890> sort<00:01:58.069> of<00:01:58.160> slightly<00:01:58.399> off<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.060> that's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
rest of sort of slightly off so that's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.090 
rest of sort of slightly off so that's
probably<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.990> biggest<00:02:00.080> challenge<00:02:00.649> but

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
probably the biggest challenge but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.499 
probably the biggest challenge but
that's<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.520> know<00:02:01.550> that's<00:02:01.640> what<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.060> do<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.390> we

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.950

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
really shiny kind of hair do you add a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.550 
really shiny kind of hair do you add a
shiny<00:03:23.820> spray<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.600> after<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> use<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
shiny spray to it after we do I use a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.040 
shiny spray to it after we do I use a
shine<00:03:25.830> flash<00:03:26.070> that's<00:03:26.340> very<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.330> shine

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
shine flash that's very it's like shine

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.600 
shine flash that's very it's like shine
and<00:03:28.350> an<00:03:28.440> aerosol<00:03:28.830> bottle<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.370> can't

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
and an aerosol bottle so you can't

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.040 
and an aerosol bottle so you can't
control<00:03:29.970> how<00:03:30.150> much<00:03:30.180> shine<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.780> deposit

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
control how much shine you can deposit

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.290 
control how much shine you can deposit
into<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> hair<00:03:31.800> which<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:32.910> helps<00:03:33.209> it

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
into the hair which really helps it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.390 
into the hair which really helps it
because<00:03:33.540> usually<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.290> shine<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.830> has

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
because usually when you do shine it has

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.070 
because usually when you do shine it has
done<00:03:35.640> stood<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.030> sometimes<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.570> overdo<00:03:37.050> it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
done stood to sometimes you overdo it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.720 
done stood to sometimes you overdo it
and<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> gets<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.070> oily<00:03:38.280> I'm<00:03:38.580> just

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and it gets a little oily I'm just

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.920 
and it gets a little oily I'm just
flipping<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.239> around<00:03:39.450> one<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.720> time<00:03:39.780> just

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
flipping you around one more time just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.750 
flipping you around one more time just
to<00:03:40.170> show<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.470> from<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.709> angle<00:03:40.770> because<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
to show it from this angle because you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.370 
to show it from this angle because you
don't<00:03:41.940> really<00:03:42.120> need<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.360> whole<00:03:42.690> lot<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:43.110> hair<00:03:43.350> to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
don't really need a whole lot of hair to

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.440 
don't really need a whole lot of hair to
get<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.950> look<00:03:44.190> do<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.520> know<00:03:44.850> she<00:03:45.120> has<00:03:45.239> me<00:03:45.330> to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
get this look do you know she has me to

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.390 
get this look do you know she has me to
find<00:03:45.630> hair<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.200> all<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> did<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.950> really<00:03:47.100> it's

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
find hair so all I did is really it's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.340 
find hair so all I did is really it's
the<00:03:47.519> twist<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.330> twist<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.930> and
