see a big white flesh
this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.300> from<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> flesh<00:00:24.840> lamb<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is from the flesh lamb and in the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.690 
this is from the flesh lamb and in the
middle<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.849> sharp<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.570> Dorothy<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:31.460> know<00:00:32.460> it's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
middle is sharp and Dorothy I know it's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
middle is sharp and Dorothy I know it's
fast<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.540> missed<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.140> if

you're going to see the Frenchman is off
and<00:00:43.129> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> middle<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> were<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and in the middle of this were like

and in the middle of this were like
Blair

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.719 

and<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> tell<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.640> very

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and I have to tell you it's very

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.109 
and I have to tell you it's very
exciting<00:01:06.710> knowing<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> am<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.909> first

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
exciting knowing that I am the first

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.500 
exciting knowing that I am the first
person<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.840> use<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> after<00:01:10.680> 10<00:01:11.210> because<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> did

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
person to use it after 10 because I did

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
person to use it after 10 because I did
a<00:01:12.540> few<00:01:12.750> years<00:01:13.080> ago<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.680> only<00:01:13.890> person<00:01:14.460> who<00:01:14.549> used

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
a few years ago the only person who used

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.289 
a few years ago the only person who used
it<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.509> Ted<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.640> actually<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:18.060> quite

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it was Ted and actually he was quite

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
it was Ted and actually he was quite
tricky<00:01:18.659> how<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.170> made<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.770> work<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.369> took<00:01:20.460> me<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
tricky how he made it work it took me a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.410 
tricky how he made it work it took me a
lot<00:01:20.790> longer<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.520> find<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
lot longer to just go to find it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.070 
lot longer to just go to find it
correctly

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
correctly

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.070 
correctly
and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:26.790> strange<00:01:27.299> feeling<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and it's a very very strange feeling to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
and it's a very very strange feeling to
be<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.420> person<00:01:30.420> using<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.900> after<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.799> only

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
be the person using it after that I only

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
be the person using it after that I only
had<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> feeling<00:01:32.790> once<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.420> life<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
had this feeling once in my life but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
had this feeling once in my life but
right<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> repair<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> needsto<00:01:36.030> event

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
right when I repair the needsto event

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:47.740 
right when I repair the needsto event
which<00:01:36.509> belong<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> Galileo<00:01:41.899> fire<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.200> time

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.770 

I'm<00:01:48.750> using<00:01:49.700> 1204<00:01:50.700> instead<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> 90

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
I'm using 1204 instead of 90

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.140 
I'm using 1204 instead of 90
to<00:01:53.049> see<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.260> nice<00:01:53.530> spot<00:01:53.979> because<00:01:54.790> of<00:01:54.909> anything

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
to see a nice spot because of anything

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.450 
to see a nice spot because of anything
that<00:01:55.420> should<00:01:55.630> stop<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.229> at<00:01:56.409> 9:50<00:01:57.159> but<00:01:57.310> you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
that should stop that at 9:50 but you

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.160 
that should stop that at 9:50 but you
look<00:01:57.610> at<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:57.940> snow<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.659> really<00:01:58.960> got<00:01:59.140> very

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
look at that snow you really got very

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.370 
look at that snow you really got very
good<00:01:59.530> residential<00:02:00.400> around<00:02:00.700> 1700<00:02:04.049> 1204<00:02:05.049> you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
good residential around 1700 1204 you

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.920 
good residential around 1700 1204 you
get<00:02:05.530> there<00:02:05.710> very<00:02:05.830> clear<00:02:06.250> spot<00:02:06.580> now<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.630> don't

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
get there very clear spot now you don't

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.550 
get there very clear spot now you don't
need<00:02:08.229> any<00:02:08.770> proof<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.940> razor<00:02:10.179> because<00:02:11.110> if

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
need any proof it's a razor because if

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.949 
need any proof it's a razor because if
it<00:02:11.709> wasn't<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.160> laser<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.940> red<00:02:13.239> dot<00:02:13.569> will

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
it wasn't a laser this red dot will

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.050 
it wasn't a laser this red dot will
spread<00:02:14.350> out<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.550> freshmen

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
spread out just like the freshmen

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.140 
spread out just like the freshmen
because<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.500> normal<00:02:17.860> laser<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.910> not

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because if it's a normal laser it is not

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.140 
because if it's a normal laser it is not
collimated<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.560> only<00:02:21.340> amazed<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.910> will<00:02:22.120> be

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
collimated and only amazed there will be

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.180 
collimated and only amazed there will be
infraction<00:02:22.989> limited<00:02:23.440> only<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.770> diffraction

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
infraction limited only a diffraction

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
infraction limited only a diffraction
limited<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:24.880> take<00:02:25.060> automated<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> fact

limited it's take automated to the fact

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.310 
limited it's take automated to the fact
that<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.890> noncoherent<00:02:27.340> sauce<00:02:27.940> fills<00:02:28.840> up<00:02:29.110> the

that the noncoherent sauce fills up the

whole screen with white light and in the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.420 
whole screen with white light and in the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
middle of the white light screen there

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.759 
middle of the white light screen there
is<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.550> red<00:02:33.850> dog<00:02:34.150> tells<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.560> there's

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
is a red dog tells you that there's

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.380 
is a red dog tells you that there's
something<00:02:36.100> different<00:02:36.250> about<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.850> red<00:02:37.150> light

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
something different about this red light

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.220 
something different about this red light
it<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:37.900> spread<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> Ted<00:02:40.239> verified<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.080> was
