that<00:01:08.360> didn't<00:01:08.630> go<00:01:08.750> over<00:01:08.780> well<00:01:09.049> with<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.530> boss

my lovely wife for 47 years

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.920 
my lovely wife for 47 years
so<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> safe<00:01:16.310> sport<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:17.780> is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
so this was a safe sport and this is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.950 
so this was a safe sport and this is
something<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.530> could<00:01:18.710> do<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.600> we<00:01:20.600> had<00:01:20.810> our

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
something that I could do and we had our

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.460 
something that I could do and we had our
share<00:01:21.259> of<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:22.580> wins<00:01:22.939> with<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.869> idea<00:01:24.200> is

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
share of of wins with that the idea is

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.999 
share of of wins with that the idea is
not<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:24.950> much<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.880> horsepower<00:01:26.210> as<00:01:26.950> how<00:01:27.950> you

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
not so much on the horsepower as how you

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:38.410 
not so much on the horsepower as how you
put<00:01:28.460> all<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.909> horsepower

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.200 

these<00:01:39.420> mechanical<00:01:40.410> geniuses<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.550> taken<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
these mechanical geniuses have taken the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990 
these mechanical geniuses have taken the
basic<00:01:42.570> tractor<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> whole<00:01:44.100> new<00:01:44.460> level<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
basic tractor to a whole new level I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.520 
basic tractor to a whole new level I
guess<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:46.050> like<00:01:46.440> working<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.490> shop<00:01:47.730> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
guess I I like working in my shop and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.190 
guess I I like working in my shop and
dreaming<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.680> ideas<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.990> will

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
dreaming up ideas just you think will

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
dreaming up ideas just you think will
work<00:01:53.420> maybe<00:01:54.420> nobody<00:01:54.900> else's<00:01:55.260> tribe<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.520> if

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
work maybe nobody else's tribe and if

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.610 
work maybe nobody else's tribe and if
they<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:57.060> tried<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.630> failed<00:01:57.960> why<00:01:58.290> did<00:01:58.500> they

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
they had tried they failed why did they

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.810 
they had tried they failed why did they
fail<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.190> proving<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:01.100> it'll<00:02:02.100> work<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fail and proving that it'll work the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.640 
fail and proving that it'll work the
thing<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.300> love<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> most<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:04.140> tractor

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
thing that I love the most about tractor

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.370 
thing that I love the most about tractor
foam<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.390> people<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.900> meet<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
foam is the people you meet and the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469 
foam is the people you meet and the
friends<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:08.130> have<00:02:08.429> bender<00:02:08.790> Dover<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> last

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
friends that have bender Dover the last

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
friends that have bender Dover the last
30<00:02:09.810> years<00:02:10.040> being<00:02:11.040> able<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.430> come<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.880> an

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
30 years being able to come up with an

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.100 
30 years being able to come up with an
idea<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.750> seeing<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> works<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
idea and seeing that it works and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.210 
idea and seeing that it works and
hopefully<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.350> better<00:02:16.560> idea<00:02:16.980> than

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
hopefully it's a better idea than

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.360 
hopefully it's a better idea than
somebody<00:02:17.610> else's<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.800> three<00:02:19.800> engines<00:02:20.220> in

line they haven't figured it out yet but
I<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:26.209> challenge<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.290> break<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I have challenge is not to break and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.120 
I have challenge is not to break and
keeping<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.970> running<00:02:30.239> long<00:02:30.690> enough<00:02:31.130> certainly

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
keeping it running long enough certainly

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.760 
keeping it running long enough certainly

the more high powered tractors their

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.520 
the more high powered tractors their
life<00:02:35.070> expectancy<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.330> shorter<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:37.290> try

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
life expectancy is a lot shorter we try

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.190 
life expectancy is a lot shorter we try
to<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.920> through<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> entire<00:02:38.970> season<00:02:39.360> without
