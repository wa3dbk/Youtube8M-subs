00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
this is why we love the phonies because

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.090 
this is why we love the phonies because
you<00:00:15.510> can<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.809> anything<00:00:16.110> you<00:00:16.560> want

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
you can do anything you want

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:34.880 
you can do anything you want
so<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.380> cool<00:00:19.619> today<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.320> better<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.680> fits

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so it's so cool today the better it fits

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.069 
so it's so cool today the better it fits
here<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> 3400<00:00:36.810> mAh<00:00:37.050> battery<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:42.079> think

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
here this is a 3400 mAh battery I think

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.389 
here this is a 3400 mAh battery I think
this<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> thing<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.120> fly<00:00:45.480> like

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
this one but this thing should fly like

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.810 
this one but this thing should fly like
what<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> long<00:00:47.699> time<00:00:47.940> maybe<00:00:48.710> because<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.609> have

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what a long time maybe because we have

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:05.050 
what a long time maybe because we have
more<00:00:51.000> mah<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.199> time

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:18.889 

okay<00:01:15.229> all<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.390> really

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
okay all right now it's really

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:35.449 
okay all right now it's really
nose-heavy<00:01:33.170> okay<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> shifted<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> battery<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
nose-heavy okay I shifted the battery a

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.389 
nose-heavy okay I shifted the battery a
little<00:01:36.149> bit<00:01:36.299> back<00:01:36.569> okay<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.250> gonna

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
little bit back okay and you're gonna

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:51.910 
little bit back okay and you're gonna
try<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> again

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.910 

we<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.070> enough<00:01:53.700> power<00:01:53.970> left<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.560> going

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
we have enough power left but it's going

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
we have enough power left but it's going
to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.720> bit<00:01:57.720> difficult<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> fly<00:01:58.560> this<00:02:11.960> let<00:02:12.960> me

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
to be a bit difficult to fly this let me

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.100 
to be a bit difficult to fly this let me
get<00:02:13.200> used<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> new<00:02:14.100> CG<00:02:17.630> when<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.750> cut<00:02:18.960> down

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
get used to the new CG when you cut down

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.040 
get used to the new CG when you cut down
the<00:02:19.290> power<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.850> need<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.390> elevator

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the power you need a lot of elevator

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:40.730 
the power you need a lot of elevator
control<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.450> 3400<00:02:39.450> mhm<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.560> actually

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
control on this 3400 mhm we can actually

00:02:40.740 --> 00:03:05.429 
control on this 3400 mhm we can actually
just<00:02:41.220> fly<00:02:41.520> longer<00:02:41.960> that's<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.140> charm

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.240 

tricky<00:03:06.439> to<00:03:06.680> fly<00:03:07.989> but<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.739> much<00:03:09.769> fun<00:03:10.189> to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
tricky to fly but it's so much fun to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.390 
tricky to fly but it's so much fun to
fly<00:03:11.079> landing<00:03:12.079> time<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.560> here<00:03:12.889> we<00:03:13.010> go<00:03:13.159> for<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
fly landing time and here we go for the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:28.449 
fly landing time and here we go for the
landing<00:03:26.859> wonderful<00:03:27.859> seen<00:03:28.219> all<00:03:28.430> our

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
landing wonderful seen all our

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.439 
landing wonderful seen all our
experiments<00:03:29.709> three<00:03:30.709> different<00:03:31.069> batteries

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
experiments three different batteries

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.319 
experiments three different batteries
okay<00:03:32.449> and<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.489> can<00:03:34.669> see<00:03:34.879> with<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> bigger

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
okay and and you can see with the bigger

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:35.979 
okay and and you can see with the bigger
battery

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
battery

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.619 
battery
of<00:03:36.469> course<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:36.980> damn<00:03:37.489> nose<00:03:37.730> heavy<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.419> I'm

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
of course it's damn nose heavy so I'm

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:53.879 
of course it's damn nose heavy so I'm
like<00:03:40.900> look<00:03:41.900> here<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.829> done<00:03:43.129> those<00:03:43.340> heavy

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.520 

finger<00:03:54.889> here<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.879> actually<00:03:56.150> Bellis<00:03:56.780> okay

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
finger here it's actually Bellis okay

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.949 
finger here it's actually Bellis okay
not<00:03:58.220> tail-heavy<00:03:58.669> not<00:03:59.269> nose-heavy<00:03:59.720> it's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
not tail-heavy not nose-heavy it's

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.259 
not tail-heavy not nose-heavy it's
actually<00:04:00.319> balanced<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.129> basically<00:04:01.669> I<00:04:01.790> go<00:04:02.090> for

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
actually balanced so basically I go for

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.699 
actually balanced so basically I go for
this<00:04:02.389> number<00:04:02.769> ATO<00:04:03.769> 22<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.669> back<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:06.560> is

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
this number ATO 22 on the back this is

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.979 
this number ATO 22 on the back this is
where<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.069> seats<00:04:07.310> your<00:04:07.430> eyes<00:04:07.549> perfectly<00:04:08.299> and

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
where the seats your eyes perfectly and

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.050 
where the seats your eyes perfectly and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
I have never had any trouble with this

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.759 
I have never had any trouble with this
plan<00:04:11.329> alright<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:12.169> I<00:04:13.009> hope<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.489> will<00:04:13.609> have<00:04:13.699> fun
