00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
happen that far is going to want to pull

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
happen that far is going to want to pull
you<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.040> side<00:02:05.340> boom<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.840> where<00:02:07.050> that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you to the side boom that's where that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
you to the side boom that's where that
stability<00:02:07.530> comes<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.159> the<00:02:08.250> core<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
stability comes in with the core got to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
stability comes in with the core got to
be<00:02:09.450> activated<00:02:09.989> you're<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
be activated you're going to have to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
be activated you're going to have to
pull<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.390> opposite<00:02:12.870> side<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> stay

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pull with the opposite side to stay

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.899 
pull with the opposite side to stay
balanced<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:14.879> that

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
balanced so that's where that

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.530 
balanced so that's where that
anti-rotation<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:17.610> coming<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> core

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
anti-rotation is coming in with the core

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.740 
anti-rotation is coming in with the core
price<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.230> need<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> stay

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
price we need to stay

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.640 
price we need to stay
right<00:02:19.870> there<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:21.940> go<00:02:22.150> ty<00:02:22.800> stand<00:02:23.800> up

okay so there's a couple different
variations<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> suitcase<00:03:29.320> definites<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
variations in the suitcase definites you

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.130 
variations in the suitcase definites you
can<00:03:30.220> use<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.510> take<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> next

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
can use you can take it to the next

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.670 
can use you can take it to the next
level<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.790> can<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.590> basically<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
level and you can do basically a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680 
level and you can do basically a
suitcase<00:03:35.980> Devlin's<00:03:36.549> in<00:03:36.640> each<00:03:36.760> hand<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.570> your

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
suitcase Devlin's in each hand so your

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.250 
suitcase Devlin's in each hand so your
traditional<00:03:38.190> dumbbell<00:03:39.299> deadlift<00:03:40.299> that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
traditional dumbbell deadlift that's

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.070 
traditional dumbbell deadlift that's
going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> be<00:03:41.530> suitcase<00:03:42.450> handle<00:03:43.450> obviously

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
going to be suitcase handle obviously

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.170 
going to be suitcase handle obviously
with<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.440> kettlebell<00:03:44.890> or<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.250> either<00:03:45.760> kettle

could<00:03:48.190> take<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.430> up<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.700> next<00:03:48.910> level<00:03:48.970> 2<00:03:49.600> bar

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
could take it up to the next level 2 bar

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.680 
could take it up to the next level 2 bar
milks<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.370> side<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.600> can
