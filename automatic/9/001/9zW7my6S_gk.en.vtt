00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.550
 if you can 1 question discouraging 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.430
 defeat not only for you but for us 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.440
 all the same what is its main reason for what 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.170
 not enough discipline today 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.430
 dedication first showed how 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.560
 play adequately played 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.880
 how to play 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.590
 to play can become that today in 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.930
 some degree also lacked luck 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:50.530
 the team no, you just need more bells and whistles 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 for a hundred years, puck out if not 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.830
 Dala will be the removal principle was not 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.239
 such that we replay them and us 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.400
 just lucky yes they are good to play yet 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.920
 these two one when Oscar is suggesting black 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.750
 metal seemed to be quite real urine 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.450
 it counts turn its favor 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.119
 that did not work for some reason could not be his 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.740
 the advantage to bring develop all the same 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:28.090
 it remains just that we are disciplined 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.660
 play you just need to add of course this 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.200
 not just aiming at the gate 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 In principle, this already becomes law 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 so there you go to the gate which is not 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.240
 a rock 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.759
 let it not beautiful and comfortable head comes 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.829
 it smells like they say we don't 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.719
 included in purely naturally shorter 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.289
 such teams as ak leopard 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.179
 tinted so can't play up 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.119
 beginning of the planet has become quite a few species 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.459
 games that need to be improved improve ska in 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.909
 your game to go to them in full 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.909
 readiness probably just need 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.720
 add 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.140
 mentality to prepare yourself 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 mentally 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.170
 in the head everything is just dedication 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.989
 add more and more discipline and everything in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.599
 this kind of physical training 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.349
 We need a good head set a little bit 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.159
 levers rebuild it personally do 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.230
 players and 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.060
 or the coach should still with this 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 contribute too all in one 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.260
 teams are all and coaches and we and the viewer
