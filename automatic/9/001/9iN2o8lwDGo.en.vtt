our installation of the via 1x agent and
the<00:01:00.590> first<00:01:00.800> thing<00:01:00.920> we'll<00:01:01.040> need<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.220> do<00:01:01.460> is

first<00:01:06.049> time<00:01:06.350> logging<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:06.859> we'll<00:01:07.219> just<00:01:07.460> go<00:01:07.639> to

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
first time logging in we'll just go to
