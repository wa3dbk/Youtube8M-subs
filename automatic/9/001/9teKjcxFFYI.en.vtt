jobs<00:00:48.929> are<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.409> cut<00:00:49.679> first<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.639> cutting<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.089> is

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:51.209 
jobs are you cut first the cutting in is

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.359 
jobs are you cut first the cutting in is
the<00:00:51.329> brush<00:00:51.539> work<00:00:51.719> around<00:00:52.049> the<00:00:52.170> edge<00:00:52.319> and<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
the brush work around the edge and the

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.669 
the brush work around the edge and the
rolling<00:00:53.850> comes<00:00:54.659> up<00:00:54.869> that's<00:00:55.199> generally<00:00:55.649> how

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
rolling comes up that's generally how

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.119 
rolling comes up that's generally how
you<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> first<00:00:56.459> coat<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:58.010> mix<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you do it first coat you can mix and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.469 
you do it first coat you can mix and
match<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.549> little<00:00:59.819> bit<00:00:59.909> if<00:01:00.029> you<00:01:00.119> want<00:01:00.329> but

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
match that little bit if you want but

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.419 
match that little bit if you want but
the<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.199> second<00:01:01.559> coat<00:01:01.709> really<00:01:01.920> needs<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.339> be

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
the the second coat really needs to be

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.100 
the the second coat really needs to be
done<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> roll<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.359> last

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
done with the roll at last

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.240 
done with the roll at last
now<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.850> rolling<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.329> always<00:01:06.539> done<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
now the rolling is always done to the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.399 
now the rolling is always done to the
edge<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> stuff<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.100> critical

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
edge but with this stuff it's critical

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
edge but with this stuff it's critical
you've<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.680> roll<00:01:14.009> as<00:01:14.399> close<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> edge

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you've got a roll as close to the edge

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.010 
you've got a roll as close to the edge
as<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.500> without<00:01:16.710> having<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.869> screw<00:01:18.869> your

as you can without having to screw your

Florida you still to get close to the

Florida you still to get close to the
edge<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> reason<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> natural

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
edge the reason is with this natural

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
edge the reason is with this natural
paper<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.280> buyer<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.850> natural<00:01:28.070> spray<00:01:29.070> paint

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
paper the buyer in natural spray paint

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.849 
paper the buyer in natural spray paint
move<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.179> temperamental<00:01:30.810> buddy<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.679> it

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
move it temperamental buddy because it

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.609 
move it temperamental buddy because it
doesn't<00:01:32.039> have<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.249> chemicals<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.969> that

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
doesn't have the chemicals in it that

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
doesn't have the chemicals in it that
sort<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:35.299> derivatives<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.420> chemicals<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:39.020> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
sort of derivatives at chemicals do you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
sort of derivatives at chemicals do you
will<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> flash<00:01:40.710> you'll<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
will get a flash you'll see the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
will get a flash you'll see the
difference<00:01:42.090> between<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> cutting<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
difference between the cutting in and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.770 
difference between the cutting in and
the<00:01:43.590> rolling<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> rolling<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.719> be

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the rolling so the rolling has got to be

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.160 
the rolling so the rolling has got to be
done<00:01:45.929> close<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.859> edge<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.049> see

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
done close to the edge as you can see

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.340 
done close to the edge as you can see
John's<00:01:49.409> doing<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.780> see<00:01:51.780> how<00:01:51.869> close<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
John's doing here see how close that is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
John's doing here see how close that is
don't<00:01:52.829> try<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.189> home

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
don't try that at home

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.169 
don't try that at home
but<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.810> you're<00:01:55.619> reasonably<00:01:56.069> close<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
but but you're reasonably close and that

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.149 
but but you're reasonably close and that
way<00:01:57.270> you'll<00:01:57.450> avoid<00:01:57.569> that
