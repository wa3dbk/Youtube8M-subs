main problem we had with this bad boy is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.970 
main problem we had with this bad boy is
that<00:03:20.580> when<00:03:20.790> you're<00:03:21.000> zooming<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.500> motor<00:03:22.799> is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that when you're zooming in the motor is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.610 
that when you're zooming in the motor is
so<00:03:23.340> loud<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.180> engulfs<00:03:25.019> all<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
so loud it just engulfs all of the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.910 
so loud it just engulfs all of the
surrounding<00:03:25.830> audio<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:27.110> addition<00:03:28.110> when<00:03:28.769> you

surrounding audio in addition when you

surrounding audio in addition when you
have<00:03:29.100> auto<00:03:29.430> focus<00:03:30.030> running<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.890> can<00:03:32.070> hear

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
have auto focus running you can hear

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.300 
have auto focus running you can hear
that<00:03:32.459> ticking<00:03:32.970> away<00:03:33.090> inside<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:34.620> also<00:03:34.860> adds

that ticking away inside that also adds

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.840 
that ticking away inside that also adds
to<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.390> audio<00:03:37.140> problems<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.310> complications
