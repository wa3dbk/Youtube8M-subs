did that work just pick it up and throw

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.670 
did that work just pick it up and throw
it<00:05:33.160> okay<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.700> was<00:05:34.600> far<00:05:34.840> too<00:05:34.870> simple<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.500> should

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
it okay that was far too simple I should

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.230 
it okay that was far too simple I should
have<00:05:35.770> thought<00:05:35.920> of<00:05:35.980> that<00:05:38.520> solution<00:05:39.520> has<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:39.910> do

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
have thought of that solution has to do

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.110 
have thought of that solution has to do
with<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.230> it's<00:05:42.190> probably<00:05:42.610> not<00:05:42.790> put<00:05:43.000> this

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
with that it's probably not put this

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.610 
with that it's probably not put this
outside<00:05:43.330> either<00:05:43.720> it's<00:05:43.990> probably<00:05:44.200> give<00:05:44.380> it<00:05:44.410> to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
outside either it's probably give it to

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.280 
outside either it's probably give it to
this<00:05:44.740> lady<00:05:45.240> make<00:05:46.240> her<00:05:46.360> drink<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.960> chicken

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
kick it soap is not part of the solution

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.560 
kick it soap is not part of the solution
