00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
fingers away like this you want to be

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.199 
fingers away like this you want to be
able<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.900> keep<00:02:37.709> them<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.250> square<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.970> that

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
able to keep them up square like that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.280 
able to keep them up square like that
you<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.890> stop<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.920> board<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you want to stop the board here and you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.110 
you want to stop the board here and you
want<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.530> slide<00:02:43.740> your<00:02:43.980> fingers<00:02:44.310> up<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.550> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
want to slide your fingers up like that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.540 
want to slide your fingers up like that
but<00:02:46.110> you'll<00:02:46.320> do<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.770> automatically

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
but you'll do this automatically

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.060 
but you'll do this automatically
basically<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.690> try<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.020> bring<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.040> forward

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
basically just try and bring it forward

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.460 
basically just try and bring it forward
a<00:02:50.550> little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.140> they<00:02:52.320> will

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
a little bit like that and they will

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.710 
a little bit like that and they will
slide<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:52.980> automatically<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.540> get

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
slide up automatically just to get

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.090 
slide up automatically just to get
landed<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:57.630> start<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.350> you're<00:02:58.800> most

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
landed you start like this you're most

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.979 
landed you start like this you're most
likely<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.269> end<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.959> or<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.350> that

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
likely to end up like that or like that

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.820 
likely to end up like that or like that
wow<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.560> line<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.130> again

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
wow that you can line like that again

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.970 
wow that you can line like that again
just<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.810> what<00:03:12.050> okay<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.800> most

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
just I don't know what okay so the most

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.880 
just I don't know what okay so the most
common<00:03:14.100> mistakes<00:03:14.430> are<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:16.110> you're<00:03:16.590> doing

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
common mistakes are that you're doing

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.280 
common mistakes are that you're doing
what<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.100> said<00:03:17.459> you're<00:03:17.940> not<00:03:18.120> even<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
what I said you're not even all the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.220 
what I said you're not even all the
whole<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.739> your<00:03:19.830> hand<00:03:20.100> like<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.370> you're<00:03:20.790> just

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
whole of your hand like that you're just

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.649 
whole of your hand like that you're just
moving<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.650> your<00:03:22.830> things

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
moving just your things

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.920 
moving just your things
it<00:03:25.659> ends<00:03:26.019> up<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:27.299> another<00:03:28.299> problem<00:03:28.540> is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it ends up like that another problem is

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.649 
it ends up like that another problem is
you're<00:03:29.349> getting<00:03:29.560> quite<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.450> vertical<00:03:31.450> Ollie

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
you're getting quite a vertical Ollie

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.430 
you're getting quite a vertical Ollie
like<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:32.650> you'll<00:03:33.040> land<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.610> bit

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
like that and you'll land in a bit

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.880 
like that and you'll land in a bit
sketchy<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:37.360> because<00:03:37.750> you'll<00:03:38.590> think

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
sketchy that's because you'll think

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.770 
sketchy that's because you'll think
you're<00:03:39.190> fronting<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.790> too<00:03:40.060> far<00:03:40.330> down<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
you're fronting is too far down the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.750 
you're fronting is too far down the
board<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.470> needs<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.769> be<00:03:41.890> bit<00:03:42.370> further<00:03:42.670> up

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
board it needs to be bit further up

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.250 
board it needs to be bit further up
another<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.000> you're<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.299> all<00:03:46.569> in<00:03:46.900> high

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
another one is you're not all in high

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.800 
another one is you're not all in high
enough<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:48.069> because<00:03:48.489> you're<00:03:49.239> either<00:03:49.269> just

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
enough that's because you're either just

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.699 
enough that's because you're either just
ramming<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.500> down<00:03:50.739> like<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.400> not<00:03:52.709> you're

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
ramming it down like that and not you're

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.580 
ramming it down like that and not you're
not<00:03:53.739> literally<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:55.079> clicking<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.290> quickly

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
not literally just clicking it quickly

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.190 
not literally just clicking it quickly
at<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.819> you're<00:03:59.069> doing<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:01.200> another

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
at that you're doing that and another

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.710 
at that you're doing that and another
problem<00:04:02.739> with<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.280> your<00:04:04.090> fingers<00:04:04.510> too

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
problem with that is your fingers too

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.240 
problem with that is your fingers too
far<00:04:05.019> up<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.620> won't<00:04:05.920> get<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.370> hi<00:04:06.849> ollie<00:04:07.060> so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
far up so you won't get a hi ollie so

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.199 
far up so you won't get a hi ollie so
stuff<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> yeah<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.220> my<00:04:12.700> battery's

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
stuff like that so yeah and my battery's

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.789 
stuff like that so yeah and my battery's
running<00:04:13.480> out<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.959> better<00:04:14.170> go<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.470> charge<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
running out so I better go and charge it

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.539 
running out so I better go and charge it
up<00:04:15.239> ok<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.810> sec<00:04:17.049> okay<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.400> when

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
up ok it's you in a sec okay and when

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.930 
up ok it's you in a sec okay and when
you<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.789> good<00:04:19.090> at<00:04:19.269> foley's<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.979> practiced<00:04:21.699> it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
you get good at foley's and practiced it

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.330 
you get good at foley's and practiced it
it<00:04:22.180> will<00:04:22.630> be<00:04:22.930> very<00:04:23.320> frustrating<00:04:23.560> because<00:04:24.160> it

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
it will be very frustrating because it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.879 
it will be very frustrating because it
will<00:04:24.430> take<00:04:24.580> quite<00:04:24.760> well<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.240> learn<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:26.590> once

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
will take quite well to learn but once

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.800 
will take quite well to learn but once
you've<00:04:27.100> done<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.520> then<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.389> learn<00:04:28.570> how

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
you've done this then you can learn how

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.050 
you've done this then you can learn how
to<00:04:28.870> ollie<00:04:29.289> over<00:04:29.680> things<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.430> might<00:04:30.550> make<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.940> be

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
to ollie over things it might make it be

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.870 
to ollie over things it might make it be
easier<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.840> get<00:04:34.260> try

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
easier to get try

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.930 
easier to get try
and<00:04:37.390> then<00:04:37.570> should<00:04:37.810> get<00:04:37.990> higher<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:38.260> higher

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and then should get higher and higher

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.190 
and then should get higher and higher
like<00:04:40.470> remote<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:41.710> phone<00:04:42.660> which<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.960> didn't

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
like remote in a phone which I didn't

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.350 
like remote in a phone which I didn't
clear<00:04:44.410> first<00:04:44.650> time<00:04:44.920> there<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.340> think<00:04:45.670> too<00:04:46.090> far

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
clear first time there I think too far

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.860 
clear first time there I think too far
down<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:51.250> then<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.760> eventually<00:04:52.030> move<00:04:52.720> on

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
down and then you can eventually move on

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.210 
down and then you can eventually move on
to<00:04:53.050> things<00:04:53.260> like<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.940> jumped<00:04:54.940> from<00:04:55.120> I've<00:04:55.690> jumped

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
to things like I jumped from I've jumped

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.970 
to things like I jumped from I've jumped
already<00:04:57.220> quite<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.580> few<00:04:57.790> meters<00:04:58.480> before<00:04:58.980> like

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
already quite a few meters before like

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.460 
already quite a few meters before like
table<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.550> table<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:01.720> yeah<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:01.990> just<00:05:02.350> keep
