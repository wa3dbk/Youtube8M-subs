like<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.900> biped<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.160> have<00:02:07.370> all<00:02:07.490> these<00:02:07.670> parts

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
like a biped so you have all these parts

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.359 
like a biped so you have all these parts
that<00:02:08.780> are<00:02:09.050> missing<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.830> all<00:02:09.950> these<00:02:10.040> limbs

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that are missing and all these limbs

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.030 
that are missing and all these limbs
that<00:02:10.640> are<00:02:10.760> actual<00:02:11.030> limb<00:02:11.270> oh<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:12.440> guy's<00:02:12.620> cool

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that are actual limb oh this guy's cool

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.640 
that are actual limb oh this guy's cool
I<00:02:13.070> like<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.730> guy<00:02:13.940> he<00:02:14.240> was<00:02:14.390> supposed<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.350> carry

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
I like this guy he was supposed to carry

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.800 
I like this guy he was supposed to carry
his<00:02:15.950> weapon<00:02:16.280> under<00:02:16.430> his<00:02:16.490> belly<00:02:16.790> beginnings<00:02:17.660> of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
his weapon under his belly beginnings of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.480 
his weapon under his belly beginnings of
the<00:02:17.930> hunter<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.490> year-long

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
the hunter I think it's the year-long

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.720 
the hunter I think it's the year-long
Dobermans<00:02:23.390> government<00:02:24.170> Gator<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.970> dope<00:02:26.740> yeah

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
Dobermans government Gator the dope yeah

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.440 
Dobermans government Gator the dope yeah
kinetic<00:02:29.240> feel<00:02:29.420> bug<00:02:29.830> Cuba<00:02:30.830> which<00:02:31.280> was<00:02:31.580> my<00:02:32.060> idea

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
kinetic feel bug Cuba which was my idea

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.350 
kinetic feel bug Cuba which was my idea
for<00:02:32.900> cleaning<00:02:33.590> up<00:02:34.090> bodies<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.270> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
for cleaning up bodies on the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.320 
for cleaning up bodies on the
battlefield<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.140> would<00:02:36.260> flip<00:02:36.500> uh<00:02:37.330> physically

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
battlefield it would flip uh physically

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.350 
battlefield it would flip uh physically
fly<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.340> cut<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.490> body<00:02:40.670> into<00:02:40.910> sections

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
fly in and cut the body into sections

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120 
fly in and cut the body into sections
and<00:02:41.540> fly<00:02:41.720> off<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> wing<00:02:42.650> where<00:02:43.010> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and fly off I like a wing where it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.650 
and fly off I like a wing where it
actually<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:44.420> story<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.810> made<00:02:45.020> no<00:02:45.260> sense

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
actually the story it made no sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
actually the story it made no sense
that's<00:02:47.660> Paul<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:49.250> was<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.520> strike<00:02:49.880> fighter

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that's Paul I think was a strike fighter

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.850 
that's Paul I think was a strike fighter
right<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.690> was<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:51.050> defensive<00:02:51.620> fighter

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
right it was like a defensive fighter

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.530 
right it was like a defensive fighter
for<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:54.100> earth<00:02:55.100> space<00:02:55.520> well<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.510> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
for the the earth space well it just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.720 
for the the earth space well it just
didn't<00:02:56.900> fit<00:02:57.110> into<00:02:57.380> her<00:02:57.620> gameplay<00:02:58.100> either<00:02:58.310> we

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
didn't fit into her gameplay either we

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.610 
didn't fit into her gameplay either we
didn't<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:59.120> her<00:02:59.390> yeah<00:02:59.810> we<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> lot<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.380> us

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
didn't have her yeah we have a lot of us

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.199 
didn't have her yeah we have a lot of us
for<00:03:00.800> this<00:03:00.920> kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.190> thing<00:03:01.370> master<00:03:01.550> cinematics

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
for this kind of thing master cinematics

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.880 
for this kind of thing master cinematics
yeah<00:03:02.360> I'd<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> cinematic<00:03:03.170> only<00:03:03.440> thing<00:03:03.680> we

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
yeah I'd be a cinematic only thing we

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.310 
yeah I'd be a cinematic only thing we
needed<00:03:04.070> more<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.580> Blackhawk<00:03:05.090> type<00:03:05.450> vehicle

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
needed more of a Blackhawk type vehicle

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.770 
needed more of a Blackhawk type vehicle
which<00:03:06.650> also<00:03:07.130> got<00:03:07.430> dropped<00:03:07.730> do<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.450> know<00:03:08.600> what

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
which also got dropped do you know what

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.270 
which also got dropped do you know what
I<00:03:08.810> still<00:03:08.930> wanted<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.500> vehicle<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.130> into

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
I still wanted this vehicle to get into

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.890 
I still wanted this vehicle to get into
the<00:03:10.370> game<00:03:10.520> zoos<00:03:10.880> eerie<00:03:11.209> cursor<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the game zoos eerie cursor to the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.410 
the game zoos eerie cursor to the
Newseum<00:03:12.580> doesn't<00:03:13.580> make<00:03:13.700> any<00:03:13.850> sense<00:03:14.060> didn't

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
Newseum doesn't make any sense didn't

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.610 
Newseum doesn't make any sense didn't
that<00:03:14.510> thing<00:03:14.660> eventually<00:03:14.870> wind<00:03:15.260> up<00:03:15.350> getting<00:03:15.560> a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
that thing eventually wind up getting a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.680 
that thing eventually wind up getting a
gun<00:03:15.830> on<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> back<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.520> or<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:17.060> don't<00:03:17.540> know

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
gun on the back of it or I don't know

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.479 
gun on the back of it or I don't know
where<00:03:17.930> do<00:03:18.200> people<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:19.070> gun<00:03:19.370> tonight

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
where do people get one gun tonight

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.000 
where do people get one gun tonight
you're<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.180> back<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.830> one<00:03:21.830> guy

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
you're right in the back and one guy

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.320 
you're right in the back and one guy
facing<00:03:22.519> backwards<00:03:23.030> yeah<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:24.019> nausea<00:03:24.230> seat

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
facing backwards yeah the nausea seat

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.670 
facing backwards yeah the nausea seat
power<00:03:26.330> craft<00:03:26.630> were<00:03:26.750> kind<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.110> strange<00:03:27.440> thing

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
power craft were kind of a strange thing

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.220 
power craft were kind of a strange thing
back<00:03:27.890> then<00:03:28.040> especially<00:03:28.160> ones<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.300> we<00:03:30.050> needed

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
back then especially ones that we needed

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.990 
back then especially ones that we needed
to<00:03:30.380> remain<00:03:30.890> stationary<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.670> certain

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
to remain stationary at a certain

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.670 
to remain stationary at a certain
altitude<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.140> had<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> very<00:03:33.350> difficult

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
altitude that we had a very difficult

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.470 
altitude that we had a very difficult
time<00:03:34.010> with<00:03:34.070> some<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.459> those<00:03:34.550> would<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:35.180> taken

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
time with some of those would have taken

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.530 
time with some of those would have taken
a<00:03:35.510> long<00:03:35.690> time<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:36.200> us<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.500> tune<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:38.000> engine

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
a long time for us to tune the engine

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.350 
a long time for us to tune the engine
physics<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.200> make<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.470> work<00:03:39.620> right<00:03:39.860> oh<00:03:40.360> man

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
physics to make it work right oh man

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.520 
physics to make it work right oh man
this<00:03:41.750> one<00:03:42.019> goes<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:43.640> ATV<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.540> got<00:03:44.750> cut<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:45.410> had

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
this one goes the ATV and got cut we had

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.199 
this one goes the ATV and got cut we had
weapons<00:03:45.769> on<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.130> front<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.550> initially<00:03:46.970> we

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
weapons on the front of it initially we

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.140 
weapons on the front of it initially we
tried<00:03:47.510> no<00:03:48.260> weapons<00:03:48.850> designers<00:03:49.850> couldn't

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
tried no weapons designers couldn't

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.490 
tried no weapons designers couldn't
figure<00:03:50.269> out<00:03:50.390> how<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> integrate<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.410> into

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
figure out how to integrate it into

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.380 
figure out how to integrate it into
gameplay<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.400> didn't<00:03:52.640> work<00:03:52.820> in<00:03:53.030> conjunction

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
gameplay it didn't work in conjunction

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.780 
gameplay it didn't work in conjunction
with<00:03:53.780> vehicles<00:03:54.350> like<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.620> warthog<00:03:55.070> or<00:03:55.370> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
with vehicles like the warthog or the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.449 
with vehicles like the warthog or the
ghost<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.870> broke<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.650> model<00:03:58.010> too<00:03:58.250> much

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
ghost this broke the model too much

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.699 
ghost this broke the model too much
