00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.019
 well the staff is doing well, I'm fine 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.640
 to present to you the brake return 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.730
 repotencing is that we are announcing 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.570
 here that workbench we have a shape 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.960
 conventional television brake a wheel 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.780
 3gb and powered first we go 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.940
 conquer conventional class 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.110
 so let's note the following we have here 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.150
 three watches 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.260
 The first watch is the air pressure of the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.440
 your truck 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.440
 Let's leave him eight pounds and a half 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.050
 We 're both going to have the pressure of 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.690
 braking your truck and clock 3 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.610
 the pressure you will then receive 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.000
 let's focus the three watches together 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.649
 you will notice that to reach two 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.510
 kilos around the normal training her to do 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.420
 exactly two kilograms to the pressure of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.220
 stretch of your truck 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 Now we're going to test the ball and 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.409
 power can increase this pressure 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.869
 for you to be another notion to three 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.069
 pounds three pounds four pounds four 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.069
 children in any difference 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.580
 Now we will connect the at sign in 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:39.300
 repowering 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:39.300
 What is someone taking this login? 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.440
 well let's go there again for your use 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.540
 these 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.660
 we need the vehicle will be in eight 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.660
 and a half as it was before 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.990
 Let's apply a pressure of two pounds 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.990
 on the vehicle brake 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.000
 so you lot the famous uncle 3 and he 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.700
 sent much more pressure than the extension 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.549
 211 sending five pounds and a watch 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.769
 of step 2 pounds 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.390
 then this is the difference in braking in the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.650
 your vehicle we will increase the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.709
 equips three pounds like we had 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.750
 done the previous procedure 4 pounds and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.120
 see that the pressure of the prize was total 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.890
 that is efficiency in your brake was 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.450
 much bigger 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.019
 Is this any doubt? 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.019
