out<00:04:49.240> just<00:04:49.779> see<00:04:50.409> something<00:04:50.710> up<00:04:50.949> there<00:04:50.979> wants<00:04:51.849> to

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
out just see something up there wants to

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.529 
out just see something up there wants to
go<00:04:52.029> see<00:04:52.240> if<00:04:52.300> its<00:04:52.449> food<00:04:53.759> Crittercam<00:04:54.759> also

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
go see if its food Crittercam also

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.689 
go see if its food Crittercam also
reveals<00:04:55.960> at<00:04:56.289> least<00:04:56.560> one<00:04:56.919> other<00:04:57.129> Bowl<00:04:57.460> in<00:04:57.669> the

reveals at least one other Bowl in the

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.790 
reveals at least one other Bowl in the
region<00:04:58.180> which<00:04:58.930> raises<00:04:59.469> the<00:04:59.680> intriguing

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
region which raises the intriguing

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.790 
region which raises the intriguing
possibility<00:05:00.539> that<00:05:01.539> these<00:05:01.810> sharks<00:05:02.229> may<00:05:02.560> be

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
possibility that these sharks may be

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.240 
possibility that these sharks may be
interacting<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:05.020> also<00:05:05.229> suggests<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.069> bull

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
interacting it also suggests the bull

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.689 
interacting it also suggests the bull
shark<00:05:06.610> may<00:05:07.240> be<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.509> keystone<00:05:08.199> species<00:05:08.699> which

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
shark may be a keystone species which

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.029 
shark may be a keystone species which
means<00:05:10.000> they<00:05:10.360> may<00:05:10.569> be<00:05:10.629> a<00:05:10.840> critical<00:05:11.529> influence

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
means they may be a critical influence

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.559 
means they may be a critical influence
on<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.550> structure<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.360> ecosystem
