look at is the very top one which is
your<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.879> setup<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:52.199> types

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
your in like setup for different types

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.740 
your in like setup for different types
of<00:00:52.739> inputs<00:00:53.280> usually<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.969> new<00:00:54.180> leaders<00:00:54.510> just

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of inputs usually all new leaders just

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.910 
of inputs usually all new leaders just
one<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.899> what<00:00:57.899> you'll<00:00:58.050> need<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.680> you'll

one so what you'll need to do is you'll

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.110 
one so what you'll need to do is you'll
need<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.309> sure<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> stick<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
need to make sure that you stick to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.750 
need to make sure that you stick to
turned<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.859> showing<00:01:02.520> your

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
sticks on the simulator okay if the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
sticks on the simulator okay if the
throttles<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> wrong<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
throttles the wrong way around then you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.280 
throttles the wrong way around then you
need<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> click<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.330> positive<00:01:12.330> pitch<00:01:12.479> normal
