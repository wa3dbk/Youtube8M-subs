like Terry said this is actually should
be<00:04:21.079> worth<00:04:21.470> more<00:04:21.500> than<00:04:22.010> what<00:04:22.340> most<00:04:22.580> points<00:04:23.150> are

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
be worth more than what most points are

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.890 
be worth more than what most points are

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
cos you find one of these per thousand

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:39.600
