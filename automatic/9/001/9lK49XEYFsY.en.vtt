00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 hello sorry staff 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.730
 Hello guys 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.240
 another episode of the game room but the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 first to be a preview of the game, use 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.529
 created by fran bars with illustrations 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.040
 illustrations in the 10 administrations of 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.610
 dani araÃºjo and marcelo graphic design 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.250
 brum is that game he is being 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 disclosed it is ready 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.830
 in terms of rules and is being disclosed 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.280
 so little dirt all over Brazil as well 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:55.900
 how much did he release a version 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:00.129
 digitally demo to ambassadors nor 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.409
 of some states in action 16 to hunger but 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.780
 is trying to be all Brazil and the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.450
 staff is taking to the events 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.630
 although games for the players to know 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.360
 this card game that he emphasizes is a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.020
 freighter not collected for two to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 four players and he is well 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.259
 interesting the story of orson wells 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.649
 following is the dream axis and the alliance 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.570
 of the platypus and they are at war 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.640
 this involves other animals but the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.630
 main are they the game comes with three 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.009
 modes and are trendy and go adding 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 new rules leaving the game more 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.710
 complicated to please all times 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.049
 of players a casual and those who 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 like more complicated rules 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:59.710
 then couples is not normal is normal 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 neither there nor here 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.039
 anyway is the rule of the game is as follows 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 Basic without changing much too late the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.170
 player will have a deficit of 25 houses 12 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.960
 swine and other men's alliance 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.850
 are links to a two player game 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:22.569
 and I will be 15 battles who in each 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.230
 battle there will be five duels the player and 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.510
 does pull in the beginning of this Wednesday and goes 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.819
 put on the table 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.260
 letters not disclosed only from 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.489
 face down 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.489
 the other player does the same thing 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.270
 there they will reveal given the most 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.840
 left that they choose is each house 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.260
 these cards they will have number from 1 to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 12 and only one for each deck with the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.310
 infinite and numbers 1 2 3 winning in 10 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.489
 11 12 and the other numbers are more in 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 question of force whether the force of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.670
 waters 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.620
 who wins three duels first win 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.380
 the battle 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.459
 whoever wins three battles first or 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.160
 without the game wins the singular game 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.260
 as you change the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.620
 paranormal game mode after 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.959
 the characters will have the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.290
 opportunity to use their weapons 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.720
 will have a matter of a mission and this will 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.090
 to be able to observe or not weapons will 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.190
 change the dynamics of the game 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.020
 at 8 am and earning more and more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.530
 strategies mainly in the 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.440
 because the duels in this mode 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.760
 they are not guaranteed and win or 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.000
 whether you reveal a first duel and 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.250
 loses you can still win when you went 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.549
 reveal other duels because guns 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.810
 characters will be able to change 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.640
 battle balance the blue is 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 by the end of March to 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.100
 start the posters and it will depend a lot 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.180
 of the outcome of how well it went 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.390
 I accept it for who's thinking who 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.960
 more characters will have a 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.280
 opportunity to create factions with more 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.620
 neutral characters 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.120
 the goals that went wrong are 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.900
 thinking only this create characters 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.810
 because the rappers are the hymn and the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.750
 monitor line - you will never see a 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.380
 little on the deck of the platypus and vice 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.810
 versa 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.790
 whenever the rest of the bicharada they are 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.000
 God then you can 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.210
 who likes this can customize the 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.940
 df by placing the animal characters that 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.490
 lining funk elephant and send instead 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.100
 to use what they also have and that is the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.590
 his goal if the guy is neither capable 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.580
 very sure it will add new 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.430
 characters 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.729
 it is as if the neutrals were the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.430
 Sweat mercenaries factions are 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.930
 closed but you can put the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.970
 mercenaries institution of other 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.490
 characters and even being a version 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.910
 demo that we give takes a look and 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.800
 this kind of art that the very people 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.500
 You 're finding it very interesting that 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.979
 It reminds me a little of a gang this business of mine. 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:54.229
 cep and sighted the stylish 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.270
 Actually, this is going to stay like this. 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.699
 so you already imagine the quality of this 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.849
 work time as the samba class 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.009
 is doing and group is working 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.069
 hard to do the design 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.050
 chart of the charts to stay 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.259
 All right until you get to the 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.020
 posters is now ready for staff 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.460
 take a look at what you are going to buy in that 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.289
 what are you investing in 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.990
 then the staff you are interested in 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:25.050
 in playing the blue goes in the board group 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.419
 games on facebook and ask and 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.090
 Who do you represent from my state? 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.750
 There, it was just going to talk and charge that it appears. 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.909
 in the events for you to test them the right is 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.490
 the staff said that many people 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.380
 cried to have many tears who 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.949
 invented playing the advanced first 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.750
 so begins the normal easy that 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.940
 things are complicated 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.000
 Actually, it's just to understand the advanced 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:59.400
 Because I played it's mud and it escapes the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.860
 I play a lot of women and I have not yet 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.340
 I got to go play in advanced mode 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.250
 because advanced one more kiss on 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:12.840
 head also seems to have this then 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:16.469
