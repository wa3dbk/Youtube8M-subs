00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
scarves to play with in terms of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.990 
scarves to play with in terms of the
performance<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> deep<00:01:12.810> waver<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
performance of the deep waver it has a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
performance of the deep waver it has a
few<00:01:15.360> different<00:01:15.689> heat<00:01:15.869> settings<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.530> see

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
few different heat settings you can see

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
few different heat settings you can see
all<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> heat<00:01:17.430> settings<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:18.320> up<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.650> down

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
all the heat settings going up and down

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
all the heat settings going up and down
this<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.400> bar<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.090> umm<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.560> find

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this little bar over here umm I find

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
this little bar over here umm I find
that<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> lower<00:01:23.850> heat<00:01:24.180> settings<00:01:24.509> don't

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that the lower heat settings don't

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
that the lower heat settings don't
really<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.560> hair<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
really do much for my hair but I do have

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
really do much for my hair but I do have
really<00:01:27.150> thick<00:01:27.509> hair<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> might<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.409> why

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
really thick hair and that might be why

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.460 
really thick hair and that might be why
so<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> usually<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.630> heat<00:01:30.869> setting<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so I usually use the heat setting that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.380 
so I usually use the heat setting that
second<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> highest<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.920> with<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
second from the highest and with the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
second from the highest and with the
higher<00:01:36.390> heat<00:01:36.810> settings<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.439> find<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> my<00:01:38.159> hair

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
higher heat settings I find that my hair

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
higher heat settings I find that my hair
is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.759> less<00:01:39.090> frizzy<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> comes<00:01:41.220> out

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
is a lot less frizzy and it comes out

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.850 
is a lot less frizzy and it comes out
really<00:01:41.549> smooth<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.840> nice<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
really smooth and really nice and the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.539 
really smooth and really nice and the
curl<00:01:44.100> holds<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.450> entire<00:01:45.990> day<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
curl holds for the entire day the way I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.679 
curl holds for the entire day the way I
use<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.560> grab<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.689> section

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
use this is that I just grab a section

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.740 
use this is that I just grab a section
of<00:01:51.810> my<00:01:51.840> hair<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.280> slip<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.820> between<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
of my hair and I slip it in between the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that this little I guess waiver tongue

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
that this little I guess waiver tongue
over<00:02:11.940> here

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
over here

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.809 
over here
kind<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.040> sticks<00:02:13.700> out<00:02:13.939> so<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:15.349> space<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
kind of sticks out so the space that you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.330 
kind of sticks out so the space that you
have<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:17.569> which<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.170> insert<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.769> hair<00:02:19.099> is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
have in which to insert your hair is

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.869 
have in which to insert your hair is
really<00:02:19.730> small<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:20.890> my<00:02:21.890> hair<00:02:22.069> does<00:02:22.310> get<00:02:22.519> caught

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
really small so my hair does get caught

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.970 
really small so my hair does get caught
in<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.420> area<00:02:23.900> over<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.500> when<00:02:24.650> I'm<00:02:24.769> trying

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
in this area over here when I'm trying

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.559 
in this area over here when I'm trying
to<00:02:25.099> slip<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.610> between<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.000> tongues<00:02:26.329> and

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
to slip it in between the tongues and

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.970 
to slip it in between the tongues and
that<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.930> get<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.079> bit<00:02:27.140> irritating<00:02:27.799> sometimes

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that can get a bit irritating sometimes

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.839 
that can get a bit irritating sometimes
so<00:02:28.879> it<00:02:29.269> does<00:02:29.540> take<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> while<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.519> get<00:02:31.519> your

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
so it does take a while to get your

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.429 
so it does take a while to get your
entire<00:02:32.000> head<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.750> because<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> fact

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
entire head just because of the fact

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.559 
entire head just because of the fact
that<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.859> have<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.340> use<00:02:34.549> small<00:02:34.909> sections<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
that you have to use small sections of

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.270 
that you have to use small sections of
hair<00:02:35.689> each<00:02:35.900> time<00:02:36.260> otherwise<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:36.890> won't<00:02:37.099> fit

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
hair each time otherwise they won't fit

in between the barrels as far as the
design<00:02:40.790> goes<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.329> have<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.720> say<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.109> bevel<00:02:42.409> is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
have to say that with the lower heat

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.649 
have to say that with the lower heat
settings<00:04:31.189> you<00:04:31.310> have<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.699> find<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.210> heat<00:04:32.389> setting

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
settings you have to find a heat setting

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.059 
settings you have to find a heat setting
that<00:04:32.840> suits<00:04:33.110> your<00:04:33.319> hair<00:04:33.469> because<00:04:33.740> with<00:04:33.919> the

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
lower heat settings which I have tried

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.050 
lower heat settings which I have tried
on<00:04:35.599> this<00:04:35.870> thing<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.710> tend<00:04:37.009> to<00:04:37.099> get<00:04:37.310> less<00:04:37.759> than

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
on this thing you tend to get less than

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.300 
on this thing you tend to get less than
stellar<00:04:38.389> results<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.379> did<00:04:39.710> try<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.009> on<00:04:40.219> the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
stellar results I did try it on the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.010 
stellar results I did try it on the
lower<00:04:40.460> heat<00:04:40.759> setting<00:04:41.060> once<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.479> all<00:04:41.629> it<00:04:41.780> did

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
lower heat setting once and all it did

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.339 
lower heat setting once and all it did
was<00:04:42.050> frizz<00:04:42.860> up<00:04:43.069> my<00:04:43.280> hair<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:44.750> wasn't<00:04:45.199> a

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
was frizz up my hair and it wasn't a

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.230 
was frizz up my hair and it wasn't a
pleasant<00:04:45.680> experience<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.550> when<00:04:46.879> you<00:04:47.030> first

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
pleasant experience so when you first

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.779 
pleasant experience so when you first
try<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:47.539> out<00:04:47.840> make<00:04:48.110> sure<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.370> check

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
try this out make sure that you check

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.089 
try this out make sure that you check
and<00:04:50.150> find<00:04:50.449> which<00:04:50.900> heat<00:04:51.259> setting<00:04:51.620> suits<00:04:51.889> your

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
and find which heat setting suits your

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.010 
and find which heat setting suits your
hair<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.490> best<00:04:52.669> because<00:04:52.969> that's<00:04:53.509> the<00:04:53.779> only

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
hair the best because that's the only

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.779 
hair the best because that's the only
way<00:04:54.139> that<00:04:54.319> it's<00:04:54.469> going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> work<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:55.490> its

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
way that it's going to work to its

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.200 
way that it's going to work to its
optimum<00:04:56.479> ability<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.340> think<00:04:58.610> that's<00:04:59.000> about

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
optimum ability so I think that's about

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.860 
optimum ability so I think that's about
it<00:04:59.270> for<00:04:59.779> my<00:05:00.199> nano<00:05:01.090> titanium<00:05:02.090> deep<00:05:02.509> waver
