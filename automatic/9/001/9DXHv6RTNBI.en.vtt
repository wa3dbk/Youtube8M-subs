00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
arm ended up like that but this was on

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
arm ended up like that but this was on
the<00:01:21.600> top<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:23.130> down<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the top side not the not down on the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
the top side not the not down on the
lifters<00:01:24.030> side<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> broke<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.960> broke<00:01:25.200> up

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
lifters side so it broke it broke up

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
lifters side so it broke it broke up
here<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.400> guess<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.509> our<00:01:27.689> fault

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
here on top I guess this was our fault

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.069 
here on top I guess this was our fault
for<00:01:28.080> reusing<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.060> factory<00:01:30.060> push<00:01:30.299> rods<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.930> we

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
for reusing the factory push rods so we

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
for reusing the factory push rods so we
learned<00:01:31.350> from<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:34.250> look<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.400> everything<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
learned from that look at everything I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.640 
learned from that look at everything I
think<00:01:36.119> there's<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> few<00:01:37.290> tiny<00:01:38.240> Nick's<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
think there's a few tiny Nick's on the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
think there's a few tiny Nick's on the
rockers<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> doesn't<00:01:41.220> look<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
rockers but it doesn't look like it it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.740 
rockers but it doesn't look like it it
would<00:01:42.420> affect<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.460> mechanical<00:01:44.750> durability

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
would affect the mechanical durability

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
would affect the mechanical durability
of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> rockers<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.850> we'll<00:01:47.850> check<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
of the rockers at all we'll check this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
of the rockers at all we'll check this
side<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> crack<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.470> side<00:01:49.649> open<00:01:49.979> but

loud<00:02:13.250> tapping<00:02:13.670> sound<00:02:14.060> coming<00:02:14.330> from<00:02:14.450> right

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870

around<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.260> area<00:02:15.580> no<00:02:16.580> matter<00:02:16.790> how<00:02:17.000> much<00:02:17.150> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
around this area no matter how much I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.670 
around this area no matter how much I
thought<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.080> first<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.410> thought<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
thought because that first I thought it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.960 
thought because that first I thought it
was<00:02:18.800> an<00:02:18.860> exhaust<00:02:19.190> leak<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.550> no<00:02:19.670> matter<00:02:19.819> how

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
was an exhaust leak and no matter how

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.430 
was an exhaust leak and no matter how
many<00:02:20.150> times<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.569> changed<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.080> gasket<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:22.730> uh<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
many times I changed the gasket it uh it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.890 
many times I changed the gasket it uh it
was<00:02:24.620> always<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.160> there<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.970> another<00:02:26.450> thing<00:02:26.750> we

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
was always so there and another thing we

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.729 
was always so there and another thing we
noticed<00:02:27.290> too<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.130> intake<00:02:28.730> back<00:02:29.090> here

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
noticed too is on this intake back here

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.589 
noticed too is on this intake back here
is<00:02:30.739> how<00:02:31.069> kind<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.459> dirty<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.090> right<00:02:32.420> back

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
is how kind of dirty it is right back

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.600 
is how kind of dirty it is right back
here<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:35.170> confer<00:02:36.170> gas<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.709> has<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.860> gas<00:02:37.190> smell

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
here and confer gas it has a gas smell

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.089 
here and confer gas it has a gas smell
to<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.599> don't<00:02:39.440> know<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:40.010> it

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
to it so I don't know what you think it

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.100 
to it so I don't know what you think it
was<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.400> dumping<00:02:40.780> excessive<00:02:41.780> amount<00:02:42.049> of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
was just dumping excessive amount of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.809 
was just dumping excessive amount of
fuel<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.560> wasn't<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.010> fumes<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.640> just

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
fuel that wasn't the fumes or just

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.949 
fuel that wasn't the fumes or just
coming<00:02:44.060> back<00:02:44.239> here<00:02:44.510> was<00:02:45.170> burning<00:02:45.620> right<00:02:45.799> so

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
coming back here was burning right so

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.059 
coming back here was burning right so
this<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.200> something<00:02:48.410> that's<00:02:48.530> been<00:02:48.769> kind<00:02:48.980> of

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
this is something that's been kind of

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.089 
this is something that's been kind of
going<00:02:49.310> bad<00:02:49.459> for<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.790> while<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.440> didn't<00:02:51.739> snap

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
going bad for a while but it didn't snap

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.949 
going bad for a while but it didn't snap
until<00:02:52.489> yesterday<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.329> a<00:02:53.450> good<00:02:53.599> thing<00:02:53.840> I

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
until yesterday so that's a good thing I

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.289 
until yesterday so that's a good thing I
don't<00:02:54.019> think<00:02:54.200> there's<00:02:54.650> going<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:54.950> any<00:02:55.370> I'm

thing sooner or later you know if this
happens<00:03:29.810> within<00:03:30.019> 4,000<00:03:30.829> miles<00:03:31.010> there's<00:03:31.670> no

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
happens within 4,000 miles there's no

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.300 
happens within 4,000 miles there's no
way<00:03:31.970> it's<00:03:32.120> going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.299> make<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:33.040> two<00:03:34.040> hundred

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
way it's going to make it two hundred

way it's going to make it two hundred
thousand<00:03:34.670> miles<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:35.060> something<00:03:35.359> like<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.660> so

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
thousand miles or something like that so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.800 
thousand miles or something like that so
that<00:03:37.069> could<00:03:37.850> be<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.389> know<00:03:38.420> that's<00:03:38.720> a
