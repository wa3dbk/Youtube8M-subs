 made 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.799
 but in society and behind the scenes of a photographic essay in history is not 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.760
 any stage 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.140
 the country bbd elisa is ex-girlfriend of freedom that you deserve all this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 with me now in the camera 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.160
 after beating makeup 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.570
 on that date that causes us to talk to you unless you are welcome not to 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.350
 has this technique is the first time in life after losing the seat of the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.070
 permanent brigade cecilia brigade throughout the poorest region work send a 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.800
 Kiss for everything

 the automaker the cities of the region 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 let's bring the technique now have to be thought the makeup has a 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.640
 feature so special that these ideas come out and not yet 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 but the thematic essay more focused on the edict there are certain 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.750
 accustomed make rehearsal is because already left the house photographed by 'papparazi' 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.830
 doing a lot of things a lot of people did not know that I had already done something 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.810
 the work earlier if you had already done better than the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.330
 paparazzo 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.800
 advertising meta catalog other things then the following perpetuated see with 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.860
 but different is accustomed to pass but we know that you have 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.330
 who worked a long time in this area but greatly intensified his work 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.310
 intensified is the program has opened several doors including from within the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.410
 right to me 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.620
 and it's one thing we expected because you never know what you can 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.300
 more people happen 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.470
 in addition these works and I just will not focus all now because you still have a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.850
 All afternoon, he said, we've been ousted to accompany the visit. 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 ride until the succession of barbarous taborda 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.529
 tell us how you decided to sign up how you do it 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.919
 to sit in the most watched house in Brazil 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.339
 It was the first time that I signed up and 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:39.009
 almost 400 thousand people sending the completed record and listeners 25 minutes 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.269
 and it was like that at a time when I was not very professionally well 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.389
 when the 200 résumés and a monthly average of the big brother was shooting 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.399
 literally for all that is on the side and I hope it will be so 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.380
 Thank God 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.140
 the right shot 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.010
 shameful 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.639

00:02:59.359 --> 00:02:59.909
 ródão 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.640
 Eduard Grandson was very good at Christmas people sometimes not everyone knows 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.639
 years and you have a career and all you've done is start with 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.449
 that you're karpinski reporters but you're starting the work before you even 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.739
 to choose a college I had already done several theater courses and 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.079
 radio interpretation 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.229
 it's a thing that happens naturally afterwards but that's how it is 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.789
 truth that now after breaking the bc will not go back to work here no 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.499
 for the time being it is not known because there are great opportunities in some 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.669
 nice proposals that I have already received that are in the axis rio-são paulo 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.369
 Unfortunately, there is no escape. 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.519
 I feel like I've never had the achievement of the things I want financially 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.510
 talking at the White House had more stabilized 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.789

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.349
 night in são paulo that had the presence of fecal coliformes in day of agenda
