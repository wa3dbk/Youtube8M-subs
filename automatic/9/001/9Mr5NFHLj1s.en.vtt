love the moment I put it on my lids so I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.210 
love the moment I put it on my lids so I
just<00:01:46.899> packed<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.440> with<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.680> synthetic

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
just packed that on with a synthetic

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.870 
just packed that on with a synthetic
brush<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.030> then<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.479> actually<00:01:49.750> went<00:01:50.320> back<00:01:50.880> with

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
brush and then I actually went back with

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.060 
brush and then I actually went back with
that<00:01:52.180> bit<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.840> brush<00:01:53.259> we<00:01:53.440> used<00:01:53.590> for<00:01:53.770> bitten

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
that bit the brush we used for bitten

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.160

and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.640> just<00:01:54.910> blended<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.509> because<00:01:55.899> that

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
and I just blended it because that

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.570 
and I just blended it because that
glitter<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.890> don't<00:01:57.039> want<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.310> be<00:01:57.399> like<00:01:57.550> a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
glitter you don't want it to be like a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.969 
glitter you don't want it to be like a
stark<00:01:58.090> line<00:01:58.810> where<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.229> glitter<00:01:59.440> starts<00:01:59.830> and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
stark line where the glitter starts and

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.410 
stark line where the glitter starts and
ends<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.399> kind<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.700> want<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.880> blend<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.240> out
