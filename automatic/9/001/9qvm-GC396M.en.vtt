pretty<00:01:48.180> cool<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.600> point<00:01:49.520> not<00:01:50.520> sure<00:01:50.760> what

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

all right guys we're back it's probably

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.240 
all right guys we're back it's probably
been<00:02:03.210> 10<00:02:04.080> 15<00:02:04.260> minutes<00:02:04.710> since<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> pulled<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
been 10 15 minutes since I pulled that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.220 
been 10 15 minutes since I pulled that
broke<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:06.540> look<00:02:06.690> out<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.870> looking<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
broke we look out of looking out a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.480 
broke we look out of looking out a
little<00:02:07.350> closer<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.800> we<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.100> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> broke

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
little closer and we think it's a broke

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.859 
little closer and we think it's a broke
Evans<00:02:08.820> point<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> base<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> just

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
Evans point think that base is just

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.900 
Evans point think that base is just
missing<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
missing on it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
missing on it
elbow<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.120> flip<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.630> out<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:12.960> here

white scraper I've ever found
no<00:04:34.190> cortex<00:04:34.639> right<00:04:34.820> there<00:04:35.030> -<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.530> real

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
no cortex right there - and just a real

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.350 
no cortex right there - and just a real
cool<00:04:36.950> little<00:04:37.130> scraper<00:04:37.760> looked<00:04:38.060> like<00:04:38.180> there

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
cool little scraper looked like there

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.850 
cool little scraper looked like there
was<00:04:38.450> one<00:04:38.660> side<00:04:38.930> what<00:04:39.169> was<00:04:39.289> that<00:04:39.410> right<00:04:39.590> there

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
was one side what was that right there

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.730 
was one side what was that right there
it<00:04:40.669> could<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:40.910> been<00:04:41.030> focused<00:04:41.450> over<00:04:41.660> -<00:04:41.840> not

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
it could have been focused over - not

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.620 
it could have been focused over - not
will<00:04:42.889> sure<00:04:43.039> about<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.430> theory<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.180> could

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
will sure about that theory but could

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.200 
will sure about that theory but could
have<00:04:44.690> been<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.610> might<00:04:46.820> have<00:04:46.940> been<00:04:47.000> my

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
have been and this might have been my

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.640 
have been and this might have been my
first<00:04:47.419> Evans<00:04:47.870> point<00:04:48.580> I'm<00:04:49.580> not<00:04:49.789> real<00:04:49.970> sure<00:04:50.650> but

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
first Evans point I'm not real sure but

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.140 
first Evans point I'm not real sure but
it<00:04:51.740> sure<00:04:51.889> looks<00:04:52.130> like<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.430> was<00:04:52.520> side<00:04:52.700> notch<00:04:52.970> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
it sure looks like it was side notch and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.210 
it sure looks like it was side notch and
that<00:04:53.210> bases<00:04:53.660> broke<00:04:53.870> right<00:04:54.080> there<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:54.560> my<00:04:55.010> first

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that bases broke right there so my first

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.860 
that bases broke right there so my first
Evans<00:04:55.639> might<00:04:55.849> be<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.030> broke<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.539> I'm<00:04:56.599> gonna<00:04:56.720> have

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
Evans might be a broke so I'm gonna have

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.839 
Evans might be a broke so I'm gonna have
to<00:04:56.930> get<00:04:57.050> back<00:04:57.169> up<00:04:57.200> there<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.650> try<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.550> get<00:04:58.760> it

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
to get back up there and try to get it

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.450 
to get back up there and try to get it

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
pretty ones this was a knife that I had

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.440 
pretty ones this was a knife that I had
found<00:05:15.440> out<00:05:15.590> there<00:05:15.800> was<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.789> pretty<00:05:16.970> good-sized

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
found out there was a pretty good-sized

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.870 
found out there was a pretty good-sized
one<00:05:17.660> little<00:05:17.870> chunky<00:05:18.200> but<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.440> was<00:05:18.700> real<00:05:19.700> cool

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
one little chunky but it was real cool

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.070 
one little chunky but it was real cool
though<00:05:20.210> like<00:05:20.389> it<00:05:20.510> could<00:05:20.599> have<00:05:20.690> been<00:05:20.780> big<00:05:20.930> at

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
though like it could have been big at

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.420 
though like it could have been big at
one<00:05:21.200> time<00:05:21.410> sharpened<00:05:21.830> down<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.070> what<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:22.340> is

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
one time sharpened down to what it is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.610 
one time sharpened down to what it is
now<00:05:22.639> but<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:23.810> was<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:23.990> real<00:05:24.169> cool<00:05:24.380> knife

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
now but it was a real cool knife

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.430 
now but it was a real cool knife
and<00:05:26.160> box<00:05:26.460> fund<00:05:26.790> or<00:05:27.360> he<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.930> he<00:05:28.140> went<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.410> a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
and box fund or he and he went to a

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.350 
and box fund or he and he went to a
mound<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.890> was<00:05:29.010> several<00:05:29.520> yards<00:05:29.670> away<00:05:29.910> from<00:05:30.030> us

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
mound it was several yards away from us

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.640 
mound it was several yards away from us
so<00:05:30.390> I<00:05:30.480> didn't<00:05:30.690> get<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.810> fill<00:05:31.050> help<00:05:31.260> out<00:05:31.410> in<00:05:31.530> this

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
so I didn't get to fill help out in this

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.930 
so I didn't get to fill help out in this
but<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:31.920> looks<00:05:32.100> like<00:05:32.160> it<00:05:32.370> could<00:05:32.490> be<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.670> little

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
but it looks like it could be a little

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.000 
but it looks like it could be a little
Gary<00:05:33.120> knife<00:05:33.330> or<00:05:33.540> some<00:05:33.690> sort<00:05:33.990> not<00:05:34.620> real<00:05:34.800> sure

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
Gary knife or some sort not real sure

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.230 
Gary knife or some sort not real sure
but<00:05:35.190> if<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.340> look<00:05:35.490> close<00:05:35.700> there<00:05:35.730> it's<00:05:36.090> got

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
but if you look close there it's got

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.690 
but if you look close there it's got
some<00:05:36.360> cortex<00:05:36.780> on<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.200> like<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.040> rusty<00:05:38.490> brown

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
some cortex on it like a rusty brown

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.210 
some cortex on it like a rusty brown
color<00:05:39.030> it's<00:05:39.270> pretty<00:05:39.480> wild<00:05:39.840> but<00:05:40.560> pretty<00:05:40.770> cool

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
color it's pretty wild but pretty cool

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.180
