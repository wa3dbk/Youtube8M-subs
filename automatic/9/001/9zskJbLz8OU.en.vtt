00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
can go left to right with the router and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.200 
can go left to right with the router and
the<00:01:41.520> rest<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> rig<00:01:42.090> stays<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.630> steady

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then I got a locking system right

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.030 
and then I got a locking system right
here<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.960> locking<00:01:49.350> system<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
here and I got a locking system right

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.850 
here and then sometimes I move these two
little<00:01:52.710> pieces<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.990> plastic<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.380> lock<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
little pieces of plastic and I lock the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.899

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
neck one I'm want to go to the end of it

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:28.630 
neck one I'm want to go to the end of it
anyway<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.090> pretty<00:02:00.210> much<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:03.530> turn<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.620> on

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640
