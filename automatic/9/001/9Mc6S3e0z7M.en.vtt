excellent customer support their
customer<00:04:32.870> support<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.350> basically<00:04:34.160> walk<00:04:34.490> not

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
customer support and basically walk not

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.210

only<00:04:34.910> did<00:04:35.480> they<00:04:35.570> walk<00:04:35.780> me<00:04:35.930> through<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:36.470> I

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
only did they walk me through it but I

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.670 
only did they walk me through it but I
think<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.760> easiest<00:04:37.880> tip<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.420> found<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:39.380> they

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
think the easiest tip I found is they

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.200 
think the easiest tip I found is they
installed<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.130> software<00:04:40.490> program<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.090> my

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
installed a software program on my

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.270 
installed a software program on my
computer<00:04:41.590> which<00:04:42.590> allowed<00:04:42.860> them<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.040> take

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
computer which allowed them to take

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.770 
computer which allowed them to take
control<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.670> my<00:04:43.760> computer<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.300> from<00:04:44.450> there<00:04:44.630> it

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
control of my computer and from there it

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.410 
control of my computer and from there it
was<00:04:44.870> much<00:04:45.530> easier<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:46.760> get<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.000> support<00:04:47.150> that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
was much easier to get the support that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.630 
was much easier to get the support that
I<00:04:47.570> needed<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:49.040> i<00:04:49.070> think<00:04:49.160> that's<00:04:49.400> that's

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
I needed so i think that's that's

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.640 
I needed so i think that's that's
