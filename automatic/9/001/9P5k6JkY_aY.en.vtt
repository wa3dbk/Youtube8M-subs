00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.040
 and you 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.020
 how about friends talking here with another 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.969
 video review and decisively pardon the 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.029
 rain but this time I bring you nothing more 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.960
 and nothing less than transformers robots 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:23.650
 in the skies 2015 bumblebee so is my 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.789
 dear friends I returned the good bunbury was 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:31.119
 makes present as it is to be expected in 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.780
 the line of transformers rip and then this 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.680
 he is the boss of the autobots 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 who would say it but well here we see that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.199
 I came back later to be the focus of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 traditional descent line mode 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.110
 auto mode sugar as they would call them 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.739
 gringos or pretentious people a car 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.620
 of racing well pretty this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.839
 wheel not very well we say but its 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 sword that is directly based on 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.979
 the saver of prime is of a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.259
 translucent plastic with very nice 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.940
 can be kept below and as you already 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.800
 you know these figures lent them to me 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.899
 good friend the bulls to review 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.810
 because I do not have any intention of 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.909
 buy them but here we see hype and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 Well, with its traditional scheme of 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.880
 colors black yellow 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.980
 translucent for windows 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.810
 and to transform it is what we are going to 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.190
 to do is let's first open the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.260
 back side 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.340
 that they were returning command was done 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.770
 to push away a little 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.470
 ok then what are we going to do now 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.470
 is that we are going to separate the doors 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.910
 in this way and we are going to do all the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.220
 assembly of the doors backwards and 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.190
 here in the eyes in the holes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.310
 where was going to be saver there are we going to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.130
 place the doors and we're going to lower everything 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.100
 this assembly and we have the part of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.920
 up we go down here between the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.300
 doors the good between the crystals 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 let's take out his arms 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.150
 and we are going to raise your shoulders from this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.030
 already used shoulder pads because 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.400
 this is the boss truth let's go to the party 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 from behind we are going to separate all this 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 assembly let's rotate the legs 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 down in this way let's take 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.930
 the crystals and we are going to lower them 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.260
 unfortunately, no, no, they do not join 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.770
 nowhere are they only there by 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.950
 friction and we're going to rotate the entire hip 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.370
 towards the front 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:56.520
 and there are my dear friends bomb of 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:59.700
 transform robots in the skies 2015 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.820
 Well, I can tell you the luigi bamboo 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.450
 he has no more joke than both 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.819
 Buy friends can you hold it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.189
 sword 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.960
 that it does pretty well whatever it is of 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.590
 everyone 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.430
 for those battle action voices 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:25.560
 I say it is not any day or any this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.200
 if that Tuesday, no player is skype 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.329
 but as you can keep your poses them 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.629
 I say these figures are not made for 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.659
 the collectors so now that more 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.060
 many like us with desire like me 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.560
 they are made a little more for the public 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.459
 childish for people who do not want 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.420
 complicate with its transformers to me the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.050
 I really do not like them but hear there will be 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.860
 who likes 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.280
 They are not very to my liking but I tell them 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.290
 again in tastes are broken genres and 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.250
 thus comparing it with the others of the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.050
 line 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.940
 at least those who are so far in 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.940
 mexico in kista estudio 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.480
 here is green blog 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.019
 must suffer what should be massive in 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.410
 comparison of him but there he is I came back 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.530
 He said he will like these figures 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.820
 There will be someone who finds their side 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.770
 positive but I usually do not 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.169
 I do not like 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.300
 that's why I stayed away from them 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.789
 but since they are lending them to me 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.120
 so let's take advantage of them I do not deny that 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.639
 they are funny figures that is what 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.400
 have if you want if you 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.440
 they play with their transformers this figure 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.009
 he's going to have fun is fast 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.770
 conversion has a good mix me with 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.250
 I confess that I have found myself 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.530
 transforming it again and again 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.909
 this not only to him but to all of the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:10.060
 line and this and I must say that they are 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:13.210
 for which they are well achieved but 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.010
 if you want to attract the hour but you have 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.669
 very neglected this line at least in 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.040
 terms of figures a little more 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.389
 complex this is the classes 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.700
 save them we have a little 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.700
 careless but this one 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.849
 I would not mind having more versions 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.610
 complex of this same character I have not 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.529
 seen the series so I do not know what 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.539
 but well my dear friends, I am 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.849
 come this is I came back from transformers 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.300
 robots in the skies 2015 and we 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.300
 say goodbye
