00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 this is one of the mountain races the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.230
 more difficult in the world the ultra-trail 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.849
 du mont-blanc 168 km who succeed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.469
 well to the French since as the year 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.960
 last it is a French who has it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.929
 won today over 2300 runners 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 Beaune from 77 countries Gadret olive 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.480
 jacquin is a mythical race 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.060
 a superhuman test 168 km around the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 mont blanc in one step with a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 elevation gain of 9600 m a challenge 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.840
 ultimate for any racing enthusiast 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840
 hiking in the mountains 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.470
 2300 runners starting yesterday at the end 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.960
 in the afternoon and among them four friends from 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.130
 long date two are two engineers 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.450
 physiotherapists 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.280
 they threw themselves a challenge 168 km had 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 almost more mounted of an everest 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 it's a bit scary it's 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.410
 the final drive and in fact 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.230
 it's almost a way of life the goal 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.730
 it's to enjoy sharing and to go 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.730
 at the end and that is happiness 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.190
 a dantesque departure in a rain 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.440
 beating the flood before the galley very 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:33.780
 quickly the column of runners commits 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:36.270
 in the slope only 8 km after the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.979
 departure the group of friends has already split into 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 two we felt she comes from a couple 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.800
 lucky releasing the engineers behind 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 and most of which we manage the physiotherapists 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 philippe and cédric the best trained 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 thirty kilometers after departure 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.720
 first assistance 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 it's their wives who are small 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840
 care 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.630
 we go to clothes a little more 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 hot for the future we have feet 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.240
 wet for four years so that's 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.069
 the same to get to the end it takes 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.989
 to cure this bias is not to deceive a 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.190
 for nothing forgotten because it is meal 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.989
 for one night for that we can put 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.330
 all alone so a grueling night 50 km 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:24.180
 between peaks and valleys with a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.250
 height difference of 4000 m at the small 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780
 morning it's cédric that pops up in the lead 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.860
 Italy 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.910
 his wife is still here to welcome him 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.819
 bah where I went through different 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.549
 phases of euphoria phases where we 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.110
 see we're good and then phases where 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.890
 we are at the bottom of the bucket and we throw more 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.450
 nothing that wants more forward 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 6:08 am halfway 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.080
 faces are marked 30% of 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.880
 runners will give up everything was ready 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.239
 physically okay but the brain said 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.239
 stop 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.030
 Cedric more than 12 hours of racing 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.290
 how many hours do you have left 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.440
 priori that 18 mid day 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.500
 cédric and philippe found each other so 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 everything is going well 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.880
 they will arrive tonight around midnight either 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.799
 30 hours after departure is for 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.290
 time two friends a second night 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.950
 white with an arrival at 8am 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.950
 tomorrow morning
