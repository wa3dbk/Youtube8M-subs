00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 I apologize from the beginning 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.049
 the same for the bad resolution 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.179
 but this video one by one bios 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.150
 option is not possible, unfortunately 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.400
 let it go and that's what it's about 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 how we can adjust this with us 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 so that the computer first on the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 inserted medium such as usb 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.019
 stick or a dvd or cd after the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.609
 possibility to boot examines the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.429
 his name is not on the disk city 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 but by the cd that for example 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.000
 is then needed if you 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.020
 Operating system installed or if you want 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 a live cd like knoppix wants to boot 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.210
 So now a few words to 2 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.280
 is you have to come during the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 booting of computer the key f2 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.120
 or move away at the very beginning 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 the same is normal and happens to be 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950
 also shown with which button the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 going 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 if these buttons do not work 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.340
 just look in the manual after 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.600
 you did that to you then 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 a menu that looks something like this 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.000
 and sense and purpose it is now just the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 boot order to adjust so that he 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.909
 just as the first of the medium offers 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.729
 from which you also want to boot 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.380
 he here now and so we go 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 Well, it may be up to you 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.799
 look different again 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 It is important to know that when building it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 just with keyboard and not with mouse 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 is operated which means I take them the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.909
 Arrow keys and the bot and with 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 I can lower the arrow keys down 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.850
 now here on the individual devices 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.009
 switchen 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.770
 Here he is the first in cd rom 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.899
 drive or boot from it if 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.939
 I then from eg usb-sticks and I can 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.649
 also the one from the usb-stick offer 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.320
 I want and have somehow at the same time 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.689
 cd rom drive a cd from the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 this can be dug up 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.119
 the first place 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 right is how I do that and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.880
 so the plus button is so high now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 pushed 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.170
 and if I fc then Bruges is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 saved and that is with us 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 finished that you can see the bottom right so fc 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 safe and exit and it was then 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.929
 actually already when it was high now 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.390
 then just from the medium 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.850
 booted 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 from which you chose this
