00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 All right, people, you said more. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 We're starting for you one more. 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 tutorial here in good bathroom program 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.429
 in this video we will work a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.650
 a little 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 I forgot the modeling here of the goal and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 then finishing this modeling goes 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 working on the issue also in the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 of the mouth what we are 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.560
 making her shine on the stage and this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.560
 It will be very interesting. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 I think this is one of the first 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.599
 tutorials so I see clear up to the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 citizen 's moment of physics is ball in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 pg teach us but only in the mode 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 laender render this does not matter 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 difference is really for me because I 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
 I want to make a game 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.260
 the contracted personnel you know 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 control the boot preference 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 So, do not forget to do it alone. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 position in this direction here for you 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.020
 is en route being inspected 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 r key you would be increasing or 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 decreasing the mother of these objects and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 press the s key 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 just remembering some commands already 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 I was there if you did not know but I believe 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.960
 that you already have some experience in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.400
 program blenders if you do not have 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 leave the comments that we are 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.619
 doing a series for beginners to 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.049
 modeling or even in the creation of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 good games you can check if staying 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.580
 in hard mode there in the options of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.500
 properties right 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
 objects that may have to fall and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 will not leave a fabric simulation 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.939
 This is one of the problems I have there. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 I caught miani and I believe that already 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.600
 Do not worry, I 'm running everything from a 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.250
 way creators go in the future. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.680
 Are you fixing this problem ? 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 I really believe that bb has a great 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 potential this will actually do 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.159
 big difference from ours we are also 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 developing our games, right? 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.549
 the staff are people you for trying 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 change these values ​​here will continue 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 falling anyway 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.720
 is really a way to body soft body 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.880
 hard is no, there really is not a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 solution is that you are 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 thus creating physics for the case 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.450
 this network but we can 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.110
 solved this by creating an appearance 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.099
 with which the ball actually collected and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 cheats a little the net né 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.670
 so leave it that way 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.349
 static is now going to fight is opaque 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 is wrong here without wanting to add a 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.360
 new material you can have the color of the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.860
 marks option that appears on both sides 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.380
 or when we obviously had 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.750
 added and year if it is enough 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.370
 last year from the ball do not in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.230
 two parts actually on this page of the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.030
 anp on the line in the next video reason 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.250
 make a reprise that the galley really 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.200
 who does not know how to do this is already a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.959
 little hit when hitting the ball 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.390
 basically three lends itself to supposedly 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.069
 network that will be here in the game is a 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.730
 screen that left with more or less close 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.160
 the way she really runs and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.600
 make a certain physics after being 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.700
 dragged you can check her 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.220
 I only ran the day you're not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.660
 adjusting this has several options 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.780
 first you can leave a body 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.760
 hard beauty is the soft body also 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.519
 but I think these two options work 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.080
 to the test property here and the mass of the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.080
 object that has to be left in a way 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.120
 the type is heavy object type 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.910
 that it is really weighing after 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.040
 You 're done, now let's do it. 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.049
 some optional things here that do not 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.820
 it is really mandatory that you are 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.079
 creating physicists to check how the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.700
 press the p key 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.220
 we even in game mode is just 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.380
 correct but we can increase the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.970
 mass is here giving an appearance of a 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340
 case an extra weight 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.200
 the object so it will collide however from 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.910
 appearance as if heavy 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.370
 then be done that personal more than 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.100
 these options that if you want 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.049
 optional here the only one really is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.730
 differentiated and will do it here is the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.290
 my opinion is to improve even the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.480
 collision but as you can verify 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 really give appearance of the ball and it 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.959
 heavier 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.820
 after this is done it is here 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.680
 to increase this value, which is a 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.510
 you can check because 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.209
 will have a physics or will it repeat itself 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.459
 dripping is not of course that much is 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.130
 simple that but the next video 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.680
 explaining better improving there is in the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.390
 if this physics of this ball is liking 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.010
 keep following people there 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.780
 remembering that we are creating everything 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.950
 player mode if you want too 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.060
 develop something because the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.709
 bomb design 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 So this person stays around here, thanks. 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.519
 for all is to continue in the next government
