00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.430

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.470
 read the right foods 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 I also made an article for myself 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.210
 I realized that I had my breakfast wrong 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.230
 Family breakfast too wrong 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.220
 breakfast and share those with you 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.800
 tips to follow for 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.260
 so that the morning starts well and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.050
 cheerfully now I will tell you about those 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 products that do not need to be consumed 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 food in the morning 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.090
 the first product is citrus citrus 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.340
 may cause people allergies even if 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.490
 you do not suffer from allergies then if you 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.280
 eat citrus on an empty stomach then it can 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.940
 cause an unpleasant rash also 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.290
 for example, drunk orange juice 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.740
 on an empty stomach can lead to 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.189
 educated 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 so on an empty stomach citrus fruits can be eaten 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.550
 before using them is necessary 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 eat for example to all your new 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.490
 [music] 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.500
 the next product is banana banana 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.409
 famous for their high magnesium content 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.289
 which improves heart function but 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.399
 Eaten on an empty stomach banana will not bring 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.189
 no good 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 if you eat natas bogan then 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.250
 you will feel weak all day long 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.920
 lethargy and banana can also be eaten on an empty stomach 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.630
 but after taking healthy food which 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.140
 You can use the next product is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.370
 raw vegetables raw vegetables contain a lot 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 acids that irritates the stomach wall 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.290
 so raw vegetables are not recommended 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
 eat on an empty stomach eating raw vegetables 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.720
 fasting can not only lead to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.210
 appearance of gastritis but also the appearance of an ulcer 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.970
 [music] 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.050
 yogurt, too, can not eat on an empty stomach or on 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.720
 empty stomach 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.780
 because in the morning fermented milk bacteria 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 that enter the body along with 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.440
 yogurt they do not need better yogurt 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 eat for 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 but if you still eat yogurt 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.420
 in the morning, in principle, much harm is 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.160
 will bring no good 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.160
 matching rain 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.290
 cold drinks slow down the process 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.740
 digestion in the body 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.590
 so cold drinks can 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.790
 consumed during meals but 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.280
 not on an empty stomach 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.300
 but if you drink a glass on an empty stomach 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 cold water and 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.670
 then work your digestive system 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.560
 so slow it will be all day so 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.770
 do not drink cold drinks on an empty stomach 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.600
 Unfortunately, sweets on an empty stomach, too 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.600
 strictly prohibited 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.790
 because our pancreas is not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.980
 manages to produce the right amount 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.160
 insulin am so maybe people 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.500
 who eat sweets every morning 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.110
 then they can get sick with sugar 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.440
 diabetes is better to eliminate sweets 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.040
 from within his diet and consume them in 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.040
 flow 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.390
 and the last product which is on an empty stomach 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.080
 probably tried every one of us is 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.129
 coffee 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.099
 most people are used to waking up and 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:03.360
 immediately have a cup of coffee a coffee 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:08.170
 affects badly and pancreas and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.659
 cause gastritis and ulcers ie coffee 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.989
 you shouldn't drink on an empty stomach at least 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.079
 it is good to eat something and then drink 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.229
 a cup of coffee I advise you to remember these 7 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.139
 products can be written for convenience 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.360
 these products for example on paper and 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:30.340
 hang them on the highlighter in order to 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.550
 every morning before you think that 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.660
 you will eat to have this list 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.210
