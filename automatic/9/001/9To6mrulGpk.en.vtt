00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello how about once to teach how 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.059
 doing it that came for me is worth 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 translatable they eat you truly and what 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 we have are the powders ours 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 papilla detectors is the goal in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.610
 my house is a mixture of two types of the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.610
 villa spoons 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.800
 5 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.720
 Well, we will come here 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 we will throw him 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.500
 some water 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.840
 well, approximately, I already know well 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 the others for my words when proposing 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.750
 plans and good a decision 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750
 a few years ago 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.440
 but you have to give us a mass 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.390
 like custard 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 one masita not be much water 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 and very liquid but good you are going to see 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.410
 because I have done all a woman 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 drops are some special vitamins for 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.400
 horner is making some vitamins 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.050
 digital stop by me but we're not 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.080
 interpreted if you're on top of the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.240
 rib was we go back to die 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.159
 and it is gradually becoming more 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.499
 we started 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.710
 here but regretted the position that is 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.710
 cold 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.820
 what we want now is to put it in the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.820
 microwave oven 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.850
 in microwave 20 seconds 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.350
 approximately and is higher 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 so I have an axis my life 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.080
 is this the syringe good as well as 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.400
 you see is 12,000 liters up to the skin 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.400
 for each one but 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 mainly it is 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.760
 and when it's full 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.150
 we have to stop porridge as the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.150
 Pizza 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 how the mixture can load the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.410
 microwave that is still entirely 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 hot is not called but is warm 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.360
 very hard and solid I show you a little 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.270
 more than hot sofia sea water or 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.069
 cold for the flow shirts for hunt 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.800
 for as you can see it will be like this 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.170
 quite with its changes 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.600
 we have to do it enough so that 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.900
 lumps are left 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.900
 and now 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.689
 and me locally up here 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.870
 at once to catch 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.390
 you have to arrive normally above 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.560
 at night a little less 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.930
 and that 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.740
 It also depends a lot 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.590
 4 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.450
 on another shore a little water for 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.870
 for this pilgrimage 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.870
 now 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.940
 is here be they two 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.490
 this is a pnv papermaker and pse will have 30 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.979
 days about here you see what 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.169
 important is that the crop is to say this 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.370
 part of here down there that was now 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.500
 empty with which you do not see very well 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.699
 but it has to be empty always for 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.710
 feed him and when full is 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.889
 how do we have to stop feeding him 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.270
 well let's put here 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.080
 the family opens its mouth guard 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.419
 way to place the syringe well 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.909
 you can press with your finger with your finger 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.909
 thumb is very important 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.479
 the cleaning cell is very important 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.650
 with water for anise so that it is clean 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.680
 always the piquito that has to be 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.110
 clean before the take is worth as well as 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.409
 dances we grab from the fair part is a 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.969
 little dot of the eyes and face 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.149
 You see there to much that is more full 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.469
 it feels so much a lot, it shows 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:23.509
 When this is full I will give it 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.399
 a little bit more but when it's full 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.899
 approximately notes that it is full is 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.879
 when you have to pay for double pap 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.699
 and until it does not lower the crop and 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.649
 the ball is the vacuum that you have to give 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.119
 again the next take forget about 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.009
 twice a day each time each 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.019
 person the people decide by the crop 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.960
 when not having much emptiness the fact more 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.449
 porridge and good for 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.770
 to keep in mind that they are always 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.090
 fed that always in winning the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.590
 internal 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.320
 in the pretty much full seven what 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.050
 considerable work there you see it 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.360
 with which we are going to put him here 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.360
 in our box and we are going to freeze 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.090
 is looking forward to this 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.580
 this summer
