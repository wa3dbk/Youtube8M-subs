00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.179
 hello people i am a relax again 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.650
 xd 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.099
 Today I'll show you a helpful one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 small tutorial to minecraft and indeed 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.770
 how to assign more ram to her java 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.680
 so that your minecraft may not be that way 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.239
 a lot of bakes or depends on what they do 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 for a problem you have in any case 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.980
 that will happen even if he has many 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.280
 If you have installed plugins then it will work 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 Much more fluent, yes, and I would 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.220
 Let's start, let's say 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.220
 First and foremost we start 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.690
 here on system control quite simply 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:56.640
 So far, we definitely have to 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 supervisory system uncertainty arises 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.450
 extended here and above 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.590
 system settings or tapping 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.270
 advanced system settings then 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
 do you come with system characteristics rhine 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 there are then here on 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 environment variables then we come in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.580
 this weird window and that is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.870
 actually pretty easy like up here 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.600
 you can just go to new 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:37.500
 give here underlined yes was great 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:43.340
 underlined option and then down there 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.340
 worth that would be with my at my pc 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.980
 xxl ccc gc redraw xms 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.950
 capitalized xms 4096 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.160
 his 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.840
 then again xfx 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.580
 then again the same but 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.390
 This time I copy that too much 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.040
 work is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.270
 I'm a bit lazy in things 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 Write here to insert 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.600
 so it would be now for a pc 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.780
 That's why I already do that up there 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.500
 I do not need that to stand 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.450
 second, you need the path 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.740
 that's what it's all about 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.380
 a delicate then we go but also something 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.390
 we have to look different 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.080
 where our java folder is we go for it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.480
 in the local volume in my 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.320
 Parts of programs are normal 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:03.210
 I have n 64 bit computer and there it is 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:06.520
 not under program x86 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.030
 we seek our folder here 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:15.820
 So there you are then you have ideas 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 Factory the moment exactly and go here 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.700
 a man goes up here in the bar 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.920
 and press address as text copy 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.000
 You can do it again easily 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.730
 close insertion can somehow see 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.650
 it's the same as it's up there 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.170
 he just needs you next 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.810
 then watch how much you minecraft 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.710
 or java in total to count 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.390
 but that should not be big 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.710
 be problem I write down in 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:56.470
 the text in the pure as much as or 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.470
 what is gigabytes and again 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.480
 exactly what you have to enter because yes 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.260
 otherwise it was a very short one 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.260
 tutorial and 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.170
 say your relaxed until then
