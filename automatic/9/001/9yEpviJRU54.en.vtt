00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.190 
we're gonna take a look at a really cool
new<00:00:05.130> complication<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> Red<00:00:06.629> Line<00:00:06.870> boost

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
new complication for the Red Line boost

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.410 
new complication for the Red Line boost
this<00:00:07.830> time<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.309> gonna<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.490> exploring<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
this time we're gonna be exploring the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
this time we're gonna be exploring the
dual<00:00:09.719> time<00:00:10.340> first<00:00:11.340> off<00:00:11.580> you're<00:00:12.090> getting<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
dual time first off you're getting a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.589 
dual time first off you're getting a
316l<00:00:13.440> stainless<00:00:13.469> steel<00:00:14.309> case<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.880> 44

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
316l stainless steel case in 44

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.900 
316l stainless steel case in 44
millimeters<00:00:16.289> done<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.100> black<00:00:17.340> ionic

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
millimeters done with black ionic

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.179 
millimeters done with black ionic
plating<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.840> there<00:00:19.080> may<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.710> color

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
plating now there may be other color

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.400 
plating now there may be other color
variations<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.150> finishes<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> future

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
variations for finishes in the future

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470 
variations for finishes in the future
but<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:24.029> seeing<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
but for right now all we're seeing is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.450 
but for right now all we're seeing is
black<00:00:24.750> ionic<00:00:25.260> plating<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.189> goes

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
black ionic plating and it really goes

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
black ionic plating and it really goes
with<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> racing<00:00:27.359> inspired<00:00:27.779> theme<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.320> red

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
with the racing inspired theme that red

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
with the racing inspired theme that red
line<00:00:28.740> follows<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.029> their<00:00:30.179> watches

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
line follows and all of their watches

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.299 
line follows and all of their watches
and<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.230> blacked<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.679> look<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> really

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and that blacked out look is really

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.479 
and that blacked out look is really
popular<00:00:33.140> now<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> big<00:00:34.770> changes<00:00:35.040> here

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
popular now one of the big changes here

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.770 
popular now one of the big changes here
is<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> movement<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is going to be the movement and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.619 
is going to be the movement and
complications<00:00:37.680> we've<00:00:38.520> seen<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> Boost<00:00:39.360> being

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
complications we've seen the Boost being

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
complications we've seen the Boost being
done<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.350> chronograph<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.129> well<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.700> an

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
done in a chronograph as well as an

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
done in a chronograph as well as an
alarm<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.770> dual

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
alarm now you're going to get a dual

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
alarm now you're going to get a dual
time<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.910> gonna<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.480> time<00:00:45.750> zones

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
time so you're gonna get two time zones

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.130 
time so you're gonna get two time zones
at<00:00:46.379> once<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.039> super<00:00:47.520> simple<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.940> set<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
at once and it's super simple to set you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
at once and it's super simple to set you
use<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> lower<00:00:49.739> pusher<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.700> allows<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
use the lower pusher and that allows you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
use the lower pusher and that allows you
to<00:00:51.239> advance<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.440> lower<00:00:52.800> sub<00:00:53.219> dial<00:00:53.489> hand<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to advance that lower sub dial hand to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
to advance that lower sub dial hand to
any<00:00:54.149> secondary<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.289> zone<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.190> wish<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
any secondary time zone you wish to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.090 
any secondary time zone you wish to
represent<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:58.140> hit<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> top<00:00:58.710> pusher

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
represent if you hit the top pusher

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
represent if you hit the top pusher
that's<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.579> change<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.059> calendars<00:01:00.809> date

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that's gonna change your calendars date

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
that's gonna change your calendars date
so<00:01:01.800> everything<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.550> easily<00:01:02.879> accessible<00:01:03.480> and
