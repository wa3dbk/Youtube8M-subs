don't<00:02:54.379> stretch<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.730> they're<00:02:55.879> going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.120> break

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
don't stretch so they're going to break

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210 
don't stretch so they're going to break
they're<00:02:56.720> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.989> crack<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.620> you're<00:02:58.069> going

change my stitch selection to s1 and
then<00:03:12.319> we'll<00:03:12.500> do<00:03:12.620> just<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> same<00:03:13.129> length<00:03:13.370> of

then we'll do just the same length of

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.940 
then we'll do just the same length of
stitch<00:03:13.849> in<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.959> same<00:03:15.140> fabric<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.829> can

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
stitch in the same fabric and you can

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.500 
stitch in the same fabric and you can
see<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.190> fabric<00:03:16.340> jumping<00:03:16.940> backwards<00:03:17.360> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
see the fabric jumping backwards and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.140 
see the fabric jumping backwards and
forwards<00:03:18.190> because<00:03:19.190> it's<00:03:19.489> almost<00:03:19.760> doing<00:03:20.000> like

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
forwards because it's almost doing like

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.660 
forwards because it's almost doing like
a<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.569> back<00:03:20.840> stitch<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.040> if<00:03:22.190> you're<00:03:22.310> sewing<00:03:22.489> a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
a a back stitch and if you're sewing a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.880 
a a back stitch and if you're sewing a
woven<00:03:23.090> fabric<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:23.900> more<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.290> solid<00:03:24.680> line

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
woven fabric it's more of a solid line

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.410 
woven fabric it's more of a solid line
than<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.160> regular<00:03:25.549> straight<00:03:25.790> stitch<00:03:25.849> so<00:03:26.390> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
than the regular straight stitch so you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
than the regular straight stitch so you
can<00:03:26.690> use<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:26.959> as<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> decorative<00:03:27.500> stitch<00:03:27.920> but

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
can use that as a decorative stitch but

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.080 
can use that as a decorative stitch but
this<00:03:28.849> time<00:03:29.120> when<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> stretch<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.989> fabric<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
this time when I stretch the fabric the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.759 
this time when I stretch the fabric the
stitches<00:03:32.480> stretch<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.470> they're<00:03:33.620> not

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
stitches stretch with it so they're not

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.710 
stitches stretch with it so they're not
going<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.069> break<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:35.209> means<00:03:35.420> if<00:03:35.599> you're

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
going to break and that means if you're

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.750 
going to break and that means if you're
doing<00:03:35.930> repairs<00:03:36.379> on<00:03:36.739> something<00:03:37.519> like<00:03:37.610> the
