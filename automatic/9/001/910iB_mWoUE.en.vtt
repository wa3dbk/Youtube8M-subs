perfect<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.910> such<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.179> weirdo

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
but for me it just doesn't feel right it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
but for me it just doesn't feel right it
doesn't<00:00:43.290> feel<00:00:43.469> natural<00:00:44.070> put<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
doesn't feel natural put it that way and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.119 
doesn't feel natural put it that way and
for<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> doesn't<00:00:46.110> feel<00:00:46.170> natural<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
for me it doesn't feel natural it's not

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
for me it doesn't feel natural it's not
right<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.370> me<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.539> okay

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
right for me I'm not going to do it okay

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.970 
right for me I'm not going to do it okay
because<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> feel<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.440> dance<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> such<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
because I feel like dance is such a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
because I feel like dance is such a
natural<00:00:50.309> beautiful<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.629> shouldn't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
natural beautiful thing and it shouldn't

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
natural beautiful thing and it shouldn't
feel<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.079> we're<00:00:52.469> patient<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.160> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
feel like we're patient if you're like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
feel like we're patient if you're like
you<00:00:53.399> forcing<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.000> body<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.510> something

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you forcing your body to do something

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
you forcing your body to do something
that<00:00:54.960> doesn't<00:00:54.989> feel<00:00:55.350> natural<00:00:55.410> okay<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that doesn't feel natural okay so this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
that doesn't feel natural okay so this
is<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.120> will<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> right

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is what I think will be the right

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
is what I think will be the right
posture<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.420> that<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.420 
instead of just pushing the chest
forward<00:01:49.260> with<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.530> shoulders<00:01:49.920> forward<00:01:50.190> if

push the chest forward that's key that a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.690 
push the chest forward that's key that a
lot<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.650> times<00:01:55.800> people<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.430> both<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
lot of times people kind of do both of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.610 
lot of times people kind of do both of
the<00:01:56.970> sake<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> time<00:01:57.480> everything<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.230> and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
the sake of time everything is going and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.500 
the sake of time everything is going and
moving<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.100> same<00:01:59.280> direction<00:01:59.340> social<00:02:00.300> it'll

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
moving the same direction social it'll

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.390 
moving the same direction social it'll
go<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.380> first<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
go back so first of all I think you

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.560 
go back so first of all I think you
should<00:02:02.520> start<00:02:02.760> with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.970> shoulders<00:02:03.330> because

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
should start with the shoulders because

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.910 
should start with the shoulders because
it's<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> easier<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.590> way

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's kind of easier that way

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.040 
it's kind of easier that way
so<00:02:05.280> pull<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.670> shoulders<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.210> push<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
so pull the shoulders back push the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.380 
so pull the shoulders back push the
chest<00:02:07.290> forward<00:02:07.800> okay<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.270> here

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
chest forward okay and then from here

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
chest forward okay and then from here
what<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> rest<00:02:10.410> okay<00:02:10.890> first

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what do we do with the rest okay first

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.840
