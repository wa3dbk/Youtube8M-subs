00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.230
 m-fix workshop today with us 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.260
 I got on repair phone lenovo s820 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:44.059
 here we will change Tula apparently 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.059
 very beautiful broken is worse 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.469
 so he has a worker look through 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 such a sequence will mean 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.830
 my 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:08.210
 get our module gets completely 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:11.210
 Krinitsy display cut off broken glass 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.180
 and glue here 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.540
 new so still wanna notice a few 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.680
 nuances it is specifically for customers 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 probably that means when the phone 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.840
 has mechanical damage exactly in 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.140
 this phone down here and like how 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.710
 standard client words everything works 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.030
 everything is good just broken glass but it 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.850
 we see outside 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.580
 but we don't know what inside can 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.759
 be damaged on the board itself 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.200
 collected state the phone can 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.930
 keep its full functionality 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.600
 when we analyze it can change 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:00.229
 it happens about percent well in 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.040
 10 out of 100 that the phone can or not at all 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.369
 write learn or let's stop there 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.700
 work correctly in terms of reboot 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 start off 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.180
 no need here the connection disappears and what's in it 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.040
 Immediately warn you that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.200
 assembled phone can work 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.239
 ok after hitting never 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.810
 understands the phone he understands 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.870
 ok he can stop colleagues on 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.870
 work 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.650
 minus 20 means we got the module with 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.650
 framework 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.790
 so she looks gum out now 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.630
 we connect it to the board and show the pieces 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.630
 in the worker here we see we caught fire 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.590
 now wait for the full load 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.799
 the sensor of course you will not work so 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.799
 he from damage 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 it's really hard to take off and because 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.280
 greatly damaged the screen and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.560
 slightest 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.610
 sloppy action wizard display 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610
 could be damaged 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.040
 we have 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.990
 everything works everything is good 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.320
 move on to the stage 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.650
 separation of the construction of the screen of the screen from 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.650
 display 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.680
 maple with 20 go to stage with 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:08.110
 bundle as we usually use our 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.110
 temperature separator let's start 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.990
 so mean 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 have finished 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.530
 and raise 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.490
 build our glass here with sugar and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.490
 here is our display 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.950
 carefully throw and believe that 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:50.820
 there was a worker so we check the worker 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:50.820
 Nabee is worth it works for us 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.490
 downloads that show all well in 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.790
 further we will also do as 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.970
 make and at the factory plan to glue 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.030
 screen display is not so how to do 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.190
 some workshops just 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.800
 I clear the display key before the frame 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.480
 Assandzh queen glue only on the rim 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.940
 how are we not going to do everything here 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.420
 works 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:27.410
 move on to the next anton so 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.410
 cleared to your 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.800
 from glue 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:40.069
 I will put a label here 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.810
 so that you understand that we stick our 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.810
 the screen is exactly to this display 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:59.539
 mark remember that is it done 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.880
 so that you understand exactly what we are 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.620
 let's do it with these two parts 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.440
 integral module they show you walks a 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.630
 another well, like on the factory already 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:15.349
 bought in china all gave you work 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.150
 so here is our module which we glue 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:22.249
 so show that it is not ready yet 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.519
 module it is glued as you see it is 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:28.609
 Now the procedure will continue 

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:31.999
 here is our mark is the same display 

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:34.249
 We can trotted it is not yet there is no more 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:38.359
 you may notice something is some 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:41.689
 glue on the border of the display type to 

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:43.939
 pier 3 well here 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.539
 we stick completely eat let's say 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.539

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.550
 all daughter keep working so 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:07:01.920
 workshop m-fix means we did our 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:01.920

 further show that this is not new 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.780
 which we did here we value 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.430
 I will connect these heaps again 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.600
 there we connected our module from lenovo 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:32.669
 s820 that was percerin 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.669
 here we have or launch 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.280
