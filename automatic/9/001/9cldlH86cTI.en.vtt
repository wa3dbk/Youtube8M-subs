00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.830
 It is UTILIZATION lock drum change of syncopation book 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.910
 Accent shift on page 47 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.769
 In cymbals and drums 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 Yari by word rear 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.280
 For example , 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.300
 bea 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.300
 Give cleanse any other 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 Wow 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.430
 6 How was 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.539
 ana 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.840
 I will try to move every measure 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.610
 voodoo 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.630
 If this is gradually raised the store 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.630
 It will be a good practice 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 war 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 voodoo 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.539
 In this area, it is necessary to have a system to cover the entire drum with considerable weakness. 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.730
 I will 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:29.220
 Naturally of this rotation system 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.220
 Moral movement is also required 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.180
 Hmm 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.180
 Hmm 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.450
 a In this way 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.860
 It would be nice if I could go up to 2 runs 3 runs 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.860
 For example, because it is No. 3 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 1 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.720
 Ray 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 bb 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.020
 web 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900
 war 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:27.950
 If you are using a metronome 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.640
 I think it would be nice to check if the store of your movement is really constant or severe 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.640
 Please do your best
