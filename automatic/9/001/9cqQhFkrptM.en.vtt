00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
cut just below a growth mode and to be

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.350 
cut just below a growth mode and to be
about<00:00:29.519> 4<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> 6<00:00:30.689> inches<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.650> length<00:00:32.000> then<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
about 4 to 6 inches in length then you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520

just want to half the phone edge and cut
at<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.739> top<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.489> basically<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
at the top there so basically you have a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.600 
at the top there so basically you have a
cutting<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.920> say<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> pick<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.300> there

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
cutting so say you pick that one there

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.410

you'll cut just below the mode and then

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420 
you'll cut just below the mode and then
trim<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.199> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:53.180> then<00:00:54.180> reduce<00:00:54.989> the

very easy one of the easiest possible
plants<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.900> route<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.950> harder<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> cuttings

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
plants to route from harder to cuttings

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
plants to route from harder to cuttings
and<00:01:27.240> that'll<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.110> another<00:01:28.619> video<00:01:28.829> so

can already see it's beginning to mist
up<00:01:52.049> even<00:01:52.439> though<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> haven't<00:01:52.770> watered<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.369> but

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Pepsi or Fanta bottle and then cut it on

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.100 
Pepsi or Fanta bottle and then cut it on
behalf<00:02:01.350> leaving<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.960> easily

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
behalf leaving a bit so you can easily

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
behalf leaving a bit so you can easily
ease<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:06.990> you're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
ease it to put back on and then you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.450 
ease it to put back on and then you're
going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> fit<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.640> nice<00:02:08.940> compost

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
going to fit it with nice compost

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.440 
going to fit it with nice compost
I got<00:02:10.760> a<00:02:10.970> mix<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.540> fluffy<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.430> PT<00:02:13.430> compost<00:02:14.060> but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I got a mix of fluffy and PT compost but

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.220 
I got a mix of fluffy and PT compost but
try<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.900> guess<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.890> from<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.100> sustainable

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
try and guess it from a sustainable

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.720 
try and guess it from a sustainable
company<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:19.160> peat

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
company with peat

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.970 
company with peat
so<00:02:21.190> film<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.490> bit<00:02:22.610> more<00:02:23.860> place<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
so film it down a bit more place the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.540 
so film it down a bit more place the
last<00:02:25.190> bits<00:02:25.520> on<00:02:25.910> top<00:02:26.270> here<00:02:26.920> now<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
all the side shoots remained is a cut

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.490 
all the side shoots remained is a cut
this<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.190> cutting<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.760> then<00:02:44.630> you're

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
this is actually cutting so then you're

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.120 
this is actually cutting so then you're
going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.740> go<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:48.880> make<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.720> remove<00:02:51.820> part<00:02:52.820> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
going to go in I make and remove part of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.710 
going to go in I make and remove part of

the bark which helps eighth route Welk

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.590 
the bark which helps eighth route Welk
helps<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.710> increase<00:03:01.130> chances<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.850> eat<00:03:01.970> now

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
helps it increase chances to eat now

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.470 
helps it increase chances to eat now
here<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.350> have<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.680> pot<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.160> honey<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.240> also

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
here I have a pot of honey you can also

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.680 
here I have a pot of honey you can also
use<00:03:05.990> rooting<00:03:06.920> hormone<00:03:07.100> or<00:03:07.520> rooting<00:03:08.120> compound

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
use rooting hormone or rooting compound

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.440 
use rooting hormone or rooting compound
or<00:03:08.930> rooting<00:03:09.560> gel<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.880> don't<00:03:11.330> use<00:03:11.900> any<00:03:12.470> I

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
or rooting gel but I don't use any I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.420 
or rooting gel but I don't use any I
want<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.600> use<00:03:14.840> any<00:03:15.170> chemicals<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:18.220> honey<00:03:19.220> is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
want to use any chemicals so honey is

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.980 
want to use any chemicals so honey is
good<00:03:19.580> because<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.690> helps<00:03:21.080> stop<00:03:22.270> bacteria<00:03:23.270> and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
good because it helps stop bacteria and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.330 
good because it helps stop bacteria and
fungi<00:03:24.920> attacking<00:03:25.700> your<00:03:26.570> wound<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.160> just

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
fungi attacking your wound so it's just

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.000 
fungi attacking your wound so it's just
on<00:03:28.580> there<00:03:28.820> I'm<00:03:29.360> just<00:03:29.720> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.930> pop<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.860> in

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
on there I'm just going to pop it in

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.960 
on there I'm just going to pop it in
like<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:32.050> most<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.380> way<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.880> you're

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
like that most of the way and you're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.480 
like that most of the way and you're
going<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.150> firm<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.570> down<00:03:35.800> now<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.070> isn't<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
going to firm it down now this isn't the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.820 
going to firm it down now this isn't the
only<00:03:37.640> way<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> propagate<00:03:38.420> them<00:03:38.930> I'm<00:03:39.500> also

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
only way to propagate them I'm also

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.610 
only way to propagate them I'm also
going<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.190> use<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.930> propagator<00:03:42.440> and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
going to use it with a propagator and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.590 
going to use it with a propagator and
I'll<00:03:42.710> show<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:44.090> next<00:03:44.300> part<00:03:44.510> of

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
I'll show you that in the next part of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.720 
I'll show you that in the next part of
the<00:03:44.720> video<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:46.850> good<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.330> that

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
the video so it's good I like that

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.070 
the video so it's good I like that
and<00:03:49.730> then<00:03:51.370> you're<00:03:52.370> going<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.850> give<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.780> a

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
and then you're going to give that a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.860 
and then you're going to give that a
nice<00:03:54.320> water<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.730> also<00:03:55.760> want<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.330> make<00:03:56.540> sure

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
nice water you also want to make sure

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.930 
nice water you also want to make sure
that<00:03:57.680> you've<00:03:57.860> got<00:03:58.070> drainage<00:03:58.460> holes<00:03:58.700> at<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
that you've got drainage holes at the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.760 
that you've got drainage holes at the
bottom<00:03:59.090> give<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.810> nice<00:03:59.990> water<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.380> make<00:04:00.530> sure

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
bottom give it a nice water to make sure

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.590 
bottom give it a nice water to make sure
that<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.160> compost<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.730> always<00:04:02.000> moist<00:04:02.300> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
that the compost is always moist and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.300 
that the compost is always moist and
then<00:04:04.810> just<00:04:05.810> put<00:04:05.990> it<00:04:06.110> on<00:04:06.200> like<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:06.380> put<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.220> on

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
then just put it on like that put it on

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.190 
then just put it on like that put it on
the<00:04:07.370> windowsill<00:04:07.700> you'll<00:04:08.270> see<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:08.990> it<00:04:09.080> all

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
the windowsill you'll see we see it all

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.260 
the windowsill you'll see we see it all
steamed<00:04:09.590> up<00:04:09.800> just<00:04:10.490> like<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:11.000> ones

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
steamed up just like that it ones

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.050 
steamed up just like that it ones
beginning<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.900> happen<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.830> that<00:04:13.640> will<00:04:13.820> create

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
beginning to happen and that will create

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.539 
beginning to happen and that will create
a<00:04:14.180> nice<00:04:14.450> sort<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.440> tropical<00:04:15.680> humid

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
a nice sort of tropical humid

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.420 
a nice sort of tropical humid
environment<00:04:17.150> which<00:04:17.810> helps<00:04:18.200> increase<00:04:18.680> rooting

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
environment which helps increase rooting

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.300 
environment which helps increase rooting
so<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.419> next<00:04:20.600> part<00:04:20.930> I'll<00:04:21.140> show<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.859> how<00:04:22.250> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
so the next part I'll show you how to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.510 
so the next part I'll show you how to
use<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> propagator

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
use a propagator

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.940 
use a propagator
like<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:26.540> can<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.140> can<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:27.350> treat<00:04:27.710> them

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
like you can you can just treat them

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.490 
like you can you can just treat them
with<00:04:28.160> putting<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.550> plastic<00:04:28.730> bag<00:04:29.060> over<00:04:29.240> but<00:04:29.810> it's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
with putting a plastic bag over but it's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.370 
with putting a plastic bag over but it's
best<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.980> create<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:32.330> nice<00:04:32.690> humid<00:04:33.230> warm

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
best to create so nice humid warm

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.250 
best to create so nice humid warm
temperature<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.730> can<00:04:34.970> be<00:04:35.120> routed<00:04:35.570> outside<00:04:35.750> but

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
temperature it can be routed outside but

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.460 
temperature it can be routed outside but
if<00:04:36.380> covered<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.460> here<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.690> very<00:04:39.260> small

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
if covered so here I have a very small

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.240 
if covered so here I have a very small
propagator<00:04:40.250> with<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.210> lead<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.110> mains<00:04:42.740> in

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
propagator with the lead to the mains in

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.020 
propagator with the lead to the mains in
order<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.480> heat<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.380> that's<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.550> secret

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
order to heat it and that's the secret

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.780 
order to heat it and that's the secret
behind<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.750> success<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.320> propagators<00:04:48.920> now

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
behind the success of propagators now

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.480 
behind the success of propagators now
this<00:04:50.120> pot<00:04:50.810> all<00:04:51.290> tray<00:04:51.620> here<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.040> called<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.310> reap

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
this pot all tray here is called a reap

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.710 
this pot all tray here is called a reap
trainer<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.360> it's<00:04:54.140> for<00:04:55.030> it's<00:04:56.030> mainly<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.570> use

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
trainer and it's for it's mainly I use

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.960 
trainer and it's for it's mainly I use
them<00:04:57.140> for<00:04:57.170> my<00:04:57.500> sweet<00:04:57.860> chestnut<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:58.550> they<00:04:58.700> have

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
them for my sweet chestnut so they have

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.120 
them for my sweet chestnut so they have
long<00:04:59.210> roots<00:04:59.750> also<00:05:00.200> played<00:05:00.620> ones

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
long roots also played ones

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.790 
long roots also played ones
so<00:05:01.670> basically<00:05:02.150> when<00:05:02.870> they<00:05:03.020> grow<00:05:03.230> use<00:05:03.410> pop<00:05:03.680> it

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
so basically when they grow use pop it

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.860 
so basically when they grow use pop it
out<00:05:03.950> open<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.760> then<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.180> can<00:05:05.360> remove<00:05:05.510> the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
out open it and then you can remove the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.870 
out open it and then you can remove the
roots<00:05:06.200> without<00:05:06.380> damaging<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.310> structure

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
roots without damaging the structure

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.910 
roots without damaging the structure
much<00:05:08.600> easier<00:05:09.080> than<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.770> pot<00:05:10.150> so<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:12.770> going

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
much easier than the pot so it's going

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.190 
much easier than the pot so it's going
to<00:05:12.980> fill<00:05:14.860> like<00:05:15.860> these<00:05:16.280> up<00:05:16.610> with<00:05:17.240> some<00:05:17.690> compost

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
to fill like these up with some compost

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.660 
to fill like these up with some compost
now<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:21.290> thought<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.950> most<00:05:22.160> of<00:05:22.310> those<00:05:22.460> elite

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
now I thought that most of those elite

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.030 
now I thought that most of those elite
trainer<00:05:22.940> with<00:05:23.180> some<00:05:23.360> compost<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.110> it's<00:05:24.890> going

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
trainer with some compost so it's going

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.950 
trainer with some compost so it's going
to<00:05:25.100> go<00:05:25.250> along<00:05:25.660> now<00:05:26.660> firming<00:05:27.260> down<00:05:28.750> all<00:05:29.750> the

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960
