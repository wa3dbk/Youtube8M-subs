very<00:01:09.840> low<00:01:10.110> lighting<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.869> blur<00:01:13.490> because

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
very low lighting it can blur because

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.380 
very low lighting it can blur because
it's<00:01:14.789> ISO<00:01:14.969> sensitivity<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:18.149> doesn't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's ISO sensitivity is not it doesn't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's ISO sensitivity is not it doesn't
go<00:01:18.479> past<00:01:20.960> 1600s<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.079> slight<00:01:22.469> problem<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.979> now

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
go past 1600s a slight problem there now

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.029 
go past 1600s a slight problem there now
one<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.359> issue<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> camera<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
one other issue with this camera is that

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.959 
one other issue with this camera is that
you<00:01:26.250> can't<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:26.840> use<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.079> optical<00:01:28.469> zoom

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
you can't actually use the optical zoom

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.300 
you can't actually use the optical zoom
when<00:01:29.969> you're<00:01:30.359> on<00:01:30.509> video<00:01:30.719> mode<00:01:31.109> except<00:01:32.100> when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
when you're on video mode except when

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.520 
when you're on video mode except when
you<00:01:32.399> disable<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> sound<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.259> never

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you disable the sound so they never

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.980 
you disable the sound so they never
actually<00:01:34.770> told<00:01:35.159> me<00:01:35.789> this<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.149> before<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
actually told me this one before I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.429 
actually told me this one before I
bought<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> camera<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.039> I<00:01:38.070> found<00:01:38.429> out<00:01:38.609> now<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
bought the camera so I found out now and

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
bought the camera so I found out now and
it's<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> bummer<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.909> can

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's a little bit of a bummer but I can

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.959 
it's a little bit of a bummer but I can
deal<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> yeah<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
deal with it but yeah if you need your

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.599 
deal with it but yeah if you need your
clarity<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.719> you're<00:01:45.899> videoing<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
clarity when you're videoing then you

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.709 
clarity when you're videoing then you
should<00:01:47.820> probably<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.259> color

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
should probably go for a different color

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.340 
should probably go for a different color
and<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.679> going<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:55.920> quickly<00:01:56.130> mount<00:01:57.350> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and I'm just going to quickly mount this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.569 
and I'm just going to quickly mount this
camera<00:01:58.619> onto<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.340> tripod<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.530> fits<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.069> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
camera onto this tripod so it fits in to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.600 
camera onto this tripod so it fits in to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.630 

and<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.570> slots<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.960> place<00:02:15.100> once<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.220> secured

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and just slots in place once you secured

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.420 
and just slots in place once you secured
it<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:18.020> lift<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:19.100> turn<00:02:19.280> it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it you can lift it you can turn it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.540 
it you can lift it you can turn it
sideways<00:02:19.670> as<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.620> there's<00:02:22.100> lots<00:02:22.310> of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
sideways as one you just there's lots of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.080 
sideways as one you just there's lots of
them<00:02:22.750> screws<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.990> things<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.590> camera

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
them screws and things on this camera

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.770 
them screws and things on this camera
it's<00:02:26.090> all<00:02:26.210> very<00:02:26.890> well<00:02:27.890> made<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> think<00:02:28.780> it's

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
it's all very well made I think it's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.200 
it's all very well made I think it's
like<00:02:29.960> gyro<00:02:30.410> sensors<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.820> can<00:02:32.000> turn

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
like gyro sensors so I can you can turn

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.180 
like gyro sensors so I can you can turn
it<00:02:32.480> with<00:02:33.290> these<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:34.550> not<00:02:34.610> gonna<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.210> know<00:02:36.190> it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
it with these it's not gonna you know it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.740 
it with these it's not gonna you know it
