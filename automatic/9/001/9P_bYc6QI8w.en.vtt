so<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:10.080> guess<00:00:10.320> let's<00:00:10.500> get<00:00:10.590> started<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.090> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
so I guess let's get started so this is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.640 
so I guess let's get started so this is
the<00:00:12.480> camera<00:00:13.230> itself<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.660> you<00:00:15.660> should<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.230> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the camera itself and you should have a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.019 
the camera itself and you should have a
charger<00:00:17.279> cord<00:00:17.609> hooks<00:00:18.570> up<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
charger cord hooks up to this or the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.090 
charger cord hooks up to this or the
computer<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.990> didn't<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.800> would

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
computer if you didn't get one I would

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.710 
computer if you didn't get one I would
recommend<00:00:23.340> either<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.570> buying

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
recommend either going out and buying

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.890 
recommend either going out and buying
one<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.519> consulting<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> people<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.300> thought

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
one or consulting the people you thought

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.130 
one or consulting the people you thought
the<00:00:28.260> goth<00:00:28.920> bought<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:29.970> until<00:00:30.810> let<00:00:30.990> them

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the goth bought it from until let them

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
the goth bought it from until let them
know<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.800> did<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> they

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
know that you did not get one and they

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
know that you did not get one and they
will<00:00:32.910> hopefully<00:00:33.090> send<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> mail

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
will hopefully send you one in the mail

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.690 
will hopefully send you one in the mail
this<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.780> comes<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.340> stick

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this this comes with it you just stick

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.110 
this this comes with it you just stick
it<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.879> there<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.670> guess<00:00:41.879> stick

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it on there and you just I guess stick

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.350 
it on there and you just I guess stick
it<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.200> handle

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
it on there so it's like a little handle

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
it on there so it's like a little handle
so<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.469> hold<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.129> by

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so that way you can hold on to it by

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
so that way you can hold on to it by
your<00:00:47.399> hand

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
your hand

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
your hand
so<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.660> obvious<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.809> front<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so that's obvious so in front here is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
so that's obvious so in front here is
basically<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.850> lens<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.420> here

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
basically that your lens right here

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
basically that your lens right here
what's<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.649> closed<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.489> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
what's this is actually closed and it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.959 
what's this is actually closed and it's
not<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> camera<00:00:58.770> view<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.850> easily

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not in the camera view you can easily

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
not in the camera view you can easily
push<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.079> won't<00:01:01.289> stay<00:01:01.559> open<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:03.080> unless

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
push it but it won't stay open so unless

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.149 
push it but it won't stay open so unless
you<00:01:04.260> manage<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> probably

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you manage to do that then you probably

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
you manage to do that then you probably
break<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.420> we're<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.049> go<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.380> gonna

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
break it so we're gonna go I'm gonna

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
break it so we're gonna go I'm gonna
read<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> says<00:01:08.130> real<00:01:08.460> quick

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
read this it says real quick

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
read this it says real quick
Kodak<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> f4<00:01:10.110> x<00:01:10.290> optical<00:01:10.979> SVR<00:01:11.460> clintons<00:01:11.820> which

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
Kodak a f4 x optical SVR clintons which

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
Kodak a f4 x optical SVR clintons which
means<00:01:12.270> suggests<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.200> zoom<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.560> four

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
means suggests you can zoom in four

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
means suggests you can zoom in four
times<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.369> original<00:01:14.430> size<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> picture

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
times the original size of the picture

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
times the original size of the picture
so<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.460> picture<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.090> here

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so if you have this picture right here

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
so if you have this picture right here
you<00:01:18.869> could<00:01:18.960> try<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> zoom<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.770> they

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you could try to zoom in on this they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.490 
you could try to zoom in on this they
can<00:01:20.040> zoom<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.670> four<00:01:20.880> times<00:01:21.150> size<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.539 

don't<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.770> said<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
don't know if I said that right but I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310 
don't know if I said that right but I
played<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.270> down<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> says<00:01:27.750> 27

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
played it this down here it says 27

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
played it this down here it says 27

million meters to 108 millimeters in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.649 
million meters to 108 millimeters in
parenthesis<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.229> says<00:01:31.259> equal<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.090> not<00:01:33.090> sure

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
parenthesis it says equal if not sure

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.760 
parenthesis it says equal if not sure
exactly<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.200> means<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.439> probably

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
exactly what that means but probably

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.270 
exactly what that means but probably
means<00:01:35.009> equivalent<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
means equivalent I'm not sure and this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
means equivalent I'm not sure and this
is<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.549> here's<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> flash<00:01:39.000> thing<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is right here's the flash thing and I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
is right here's the flash thing and I
don't<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.049> exactly<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> though

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
don't know exactly we want that though

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
don't know exactly we want that though
that's<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.930> for<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.140> charging<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's like for when you're charging it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.149 
that's like for when you're charging it
it<00:01:43.680> blinks<00:01:44.310> red<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:45.000> green<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:46.560> exactly<00:01:46.950> sure

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it blinks red or green not exactly sure

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.200 
it blinks red or green not exactly sure
so<00:01:47.700> I'll<00:01:48.689> let<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> guys<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.439> camera<00:01:49.710> is

back and go to the camera camera is not
very<00:03:46.989> well<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.290> only<00:03:47.409> does<00:03:47.620> 640<00:03:48.519> by<00:03:48.639> 480<00:03:49.319> pixels

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
very well it only does 640 by 480 pixels

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.430 
very well it only does 640 by 480 pixels
so<00:03:51.609> it's<00:03:51.760> not<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.299> best<00:03:52.479> just<00:03:52.810> only<00:03:53.290> for

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
a square to the bottom here you just

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.689 
a square to the bottom here you just
resize<00:03:58.479> it<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.859> can<00:04:00.010> fit<00:04:00.159> it<00:04:00.280> right<00:04:00.340> onto

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
resize it and you can fit it right onto

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.449 
resize it and you can fit it right onto
the<00:04:01.229> screen<00:04:02.229> right<00:04:02.440> there<00:04:02.680> where<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.370> gonna

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
the screen right there where you gonna

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.890 
the screen right there where you gonna
put<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.090> video<00:04:04.359> or<00:04:04.510> something<00:04:04.659> if

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
put it in like a video or something if

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.140 
put it in like a video or something if
you<00:04:04.989> just<00:04:05.019> like<00:04:05.919> playing<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> game<00:04:06.489> play<00:04:06.879> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
you just like playing the game play and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.210 
you just like playing the game play and
then<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.269> can<00:04:07.479> just<00:04:07.629> get<00:04:08.349> like<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.560> 32<00:04:08.979> gigabyte

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
then you can just get like a 32 gigabyte

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.610 
then you can just get like a 32 gigabyte
hard<00:04:09.669> drive<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.120> record<00:04:10.540> for<00:04:10.750> an<00:04:11.409> hour

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
hard drive and just record for an hour

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.430 
hard drive and just record for an hour
or<00:04:12.040> two<00:04:12.069> whatever<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:12.879> just<00:04:13.319> getting<00:04:14.319> this

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
or two whatever it is just getting this

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.259 
or two whatever it is just getting this
hopefully<00:04:14.859> perfectly<00:04:15.430> on<00:04:15.579> you<00:04:15.729> and<00:04:15.940> then<00:04:16.060> you

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
hopefully perfectly on you and then you

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.810 
hopefully perfectly on you and then you
could<00:04:16.389> just<00:04:16.570> record<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.949> then<00:04:18.099> just<00:04:18.489> stick<00:04:18.729> it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
could just record and then just stick it

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.580 
could just record and then just stick it
in<00:04:18.909> there<00:04:18.970> when<00:04:19.209> it's<00:04:19.329> done<00:04:19.479> so<00:04:20.289> that's<00:04:20.409> pretty

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
in there when it's done so that's pretty

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.409 
in there when it's done so that's pretty
cool<00:04:20.769> then<00:04:21.729> you've<00:04:21.909> got

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
cool then you've got

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.029 
cool then you've got
your<00:04:24.430> peregrine<00:04:25.430> which<00:04:25.699> has<00:04:25.879> all<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:27.039> capture

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
your peregrine which has all the capture

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.580 
your peregrine which has all the capture
settings<00:04:28.400> for<00:04:29.240> general<00:04:29.810> picture<00:04:30.020> taking<00:04:30.409> with

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
settings for general picture taking with

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.350 
settings for general picture taking with
access<00:04:31.039> to<00:04:31.159> all<00:04:31.310> capture<00:04:31.610> settings<00:04:31.789> I<00:04:32.150> just

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
access to all capture settings I just

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.999 
access to all capture settings I just
said<00:04:32.509> that<00:04:32.689> over<00:04:33.110> again<00:04:33.319> but<00:04:33.529> it<00:04:33.800> doesn't

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
said that over again but it doesn't

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.980 
said that over again but it doesn't
matter<00:04:34.129> it<00:04:34.279> scenes<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:34.969> then<00:04:35.090> this<00:04:35.659> is<00:04:35.810> like

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
matter it scenes and then this is like

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.649 
matter it scenes and then this is like
if<00:04:36.259> you<00:04:36.289> need<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.159> change<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.729> lighting<00:04:37.969> this

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
if you need to change the lighting this

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.450 
if you need to change the lighting this
helps<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.229> easier<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.919> you<00:04:39.949> don't<00:04:40.249> have<00:04:40.340> to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
helps it easier so you don't have to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.189 
helps it easier so you don't have to
worry<00:04:40.610> about<00:04:40.729> adjusting<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.629> even<00:04:41.960> if<00:04:42.050> there

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
worry about adjusting it even if there

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.390 
worry about adjusting it even if there
it<00:04:42.349> I<00:04:42.379> don't<00:04:42.650> know<00:04:42.740> if<00:04:42.800> there<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:42.949> but<00:04:43.189> I'm<00:04:43.279> not

picture here it'll put them all together

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.580 
picture here it'll put them all together
which<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.960> pretty<00:04:54.110> cool<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:57.110> then<00:04:57.259> you've<00:04:57.439> got

00:04:59.019 --> 00:04:59.029 
this one if you take a pic this is a

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.550 
this one if you take a pic this is a
panoramic<00:04:59.569> right<00:04:59.840> to<00:04:59.960> left<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:00.289> you<00:05:00.379> take<00:05:00.529> a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
panoramic right to left so you take a

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.230 
panoramic right to left so you take a
picture<00:05:00.740> here<00:05:00.979> here<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:01.669> instead<00:05:02.180> of

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
picture here here and here instead of

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240 
picture here here and here instead of
going<00:05:02.330> from<00:05:02.689> here<00:05:02.930> here<00:05:03.199> here<00:05:03.409> so<00:05:03.949> instead<00:05:04.069> of

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
going from here here here so instead of

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.559 
going from here here here so instead of
going<00:05:04.550> from<00:05:04.669> left<00:05:04.909> to<00:05:04.969> right<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.240> go<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.389> right

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
going from left to right you go to right

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.540 
going from left to right you go to right
to<00:05:05.689> left<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.740> takes<00:05:06.949> three<00:05:07.189> pictures

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
to left and it takes three pictures

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.439 
to left and it takes three pictures
three<00:05:08.500> then<00:05:09.500> you've<00:05:09.590> got<00:05:09.800> your<00:05:10.270> blur<00:05:11.270> motion

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
three then you've got your blur motion

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.820 
three then you've got your blur motion
so<00:05:11.870> if<00:05:11.960> you're<00:05:12.139> trying<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.379> take<00:05:12.500> picture<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
so if you're trying to take picture of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.890 
so if you're trying to take picture of
something<00:05:13.129> that's<00:05:13.250> running<00:05:13.430> really<00:05:13.639> fast

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
something that's running really fast

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.959 
something that's running really fast
then<00:05:14.900> you'd<00:05:15.319> use<00:05:15.589> this<00:05:15.919> because<00:05:16.699> it'll

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
then you'd use this because it'll

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.529 
then you'd use this because it'll
eliminate<00:05:17.419> much<00:05:17.930> blur<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:20.060> we<00:05:20.270> don't<00:05:20.449> need

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
eliminate much blur but we don't need

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.029 
eliminate much blur but we don't need
that<00:05:20.719> so<00:05:21.099> now<00:05:22.099> we're<00:05:22.249> gonna<00:05:22.339> go<00:05:22.550> back<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.969> the

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
that so now we're gonna go back to the

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.429 
that so now we're gonna go back to the
smart<00:05:25.039> capture<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.879> we're<00:05:26.089> gonna<00:05:26.379> show<00:05:27.379> you

you scroll down to the first one capture
size<00:05:34.210> 14<00:05:35.210> megapixels<00:05:35.839> is<00:05:35.960> highest<00:05:36.349> so<00:05:36.439> if

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
size 14 megapixels is highest so if

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.490 
size 14 megapixels is highest so if
you're<00:05:36.830> gonna<00:05:36.919> have<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.159> 4<00:05:37.339> by<00:05:37.460> 3<00:05:37.610> ratio<00:05:38.500> it's

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
you're gonna have the 4 by 3 ratio it's

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.100 
you're gonna have the 4 by 3 ratio it's
not<00:05:39.680> very<00:05:39.889> big<00:05:40.129> it's<00:05:41.060> not<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.479> best<00:05:41.779> for

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
not very big it's not the best for

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.249 
not very big it's not the best for
uploading<00:05:42.439> photos<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.279> YouTube<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.110> make

up like video of photos or something

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.219 
up like video of photos or something
it's<00:05:49.399> not<00:05:49.520> gonna<00:05:49.639> be<00:05:50.270> very<00:05:50.300> good<00:05:50.539> but<00:05:51.050> if<00:05:51.139> you

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
it's not gonna be very good but if you

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.399 
it's not gonna be very good but if you
use<00:05:51.439> the<00:05:51.969> 16<00:05:52.969> by<00:05:53.120> 9<00:05:53.149> it<00:05:53.599> just<00:05:53.870> only<00:05:53.960> makes<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.289> on

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
use the 16 by 9 it just only makes it on

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.889 
use the 16 by 9 it just only makes it on
10<00:05:54.680> megapixels<00:05:55.310> it<00:05:55.669> this<00:05:56.240> will<00:05:56.419> be<00:05:56.509> good<00:05:56.659> for

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 
10 megapixels it this will be good for

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.219 
10 megapixels it this will be good for
