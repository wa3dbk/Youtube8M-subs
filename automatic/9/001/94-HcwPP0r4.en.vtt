00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
control but also good coverage fairly

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.670 
control but also good coverage fairly
quickly<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:49.020> basically<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
quickly and you're basically going to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
quickly and you're basically going to
mark<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> eye<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:51.090> follow<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
mark out the eye so you would follow the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.679 
mark out the eye so you would follow the
line<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.390> try<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.540> just

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
line that you have and then try and just

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.880 
line that you have and then try and just
work<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.020> roughly<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.590> you're<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
work out roughly where you're going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.380 
work out roughly where you're going to
go<00:01:56.009> again<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> you'll<00:01:56.820> cover<00:01:57.030> everything

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
go again and you'll cover everything

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
go again and you'll cover everything
doing<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> lid<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.159> close<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
doing the lid and up as close as you can

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
doing the lid and up as close as you can
to<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> lash<00:02:00.420> line<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.979> what<00:02:02.130> I'm

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to the lash line so that's what I'm

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.950 
to the lash line so that's what I'm
going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.460> ahead<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.969> do

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.630 

you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.400 

once<00:02:22.640> you've<00:02:22.819> been<00:02:22.970> done<00:02:23.240> there<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> am<00:02:23.810> part<00:02:24.319> of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
once you've been done there I am part of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.720 
once you've been done there I am part of
the<00:02:24.530> eye<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.100> you're<00:02:25.280> probably<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
the eye then you're probably going to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.600 
the eye then you're probably going to
have<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.090> eight<00:02:26.690> sort<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.830> skin<00:02:28.130> tone<00:02:28.340> on

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
have like eight sort of or skin tone on

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.610 
have like eight sort of or skin tone on
the<00:02:28.670> actual<00:02:29.180> waterline<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.200> take<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the actual waterline so just take a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.340 
the actual waterline so just take a
black<00:02:31.130> eye<00:02:31.400> pencil<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.300> we're<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.080> gonna

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
black eye pencil and we're just gonna

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.800 
black eye pencil and we're just gonna
draw<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.920> along<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:35.270> could<00:02:35.540> do<00:02:35.690> this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
draw that along there you could do this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.080 
draw that along there you could do this
before<00:02:36.020> if<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.220> don't<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> steady<00:02:37.820> hand

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
before if you don't have a steady hand

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.580 
before if you don't have a steady hand
because<00:02:38.450> obviously<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.870> can't<00:02:39.170> go<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.440> and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
because obviously you can't go in and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.560 
because obviously you can't go in and
pull<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.070> eye<00:02:40.190> down<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> paint

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
pull the eye down because of the paint

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.960 
pull the eye down because of the paint
that's<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.959> there<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.400> just<00:02:43.610> want<00:02:43.820> that

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
that's on there but you just want that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.240 
that's on there but you just want that
to<00:02:44.180> be<00:02:44.300> as<00:02:44.480> dark<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:44.990> possible<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.950> may<00:02:46.100> need

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to be as dark as possible you may need

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.410 
to be as dark as possible you may need
to<00:02:46.370> top<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.790> again<00:02:47.060> after<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:49.270> then<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
to top it up again after and then the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.180 
to top it up again after and then the
other<00:02:50.630> little<00:02:51.170> detail<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.920> we're<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.130> to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
other little detail that we're going to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.360 
other little detail that we're going to
do<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.790> your<00:02:52.819> nose<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.770> see<00:02:55.010> I've

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
do is on your nose if you can see I've

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.630 
do is on your nose if you can see I've
already<00:02:55.610> done<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.720> side<00:02:56.989> here<00:02:57.440> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
already done that on this side here and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.009 
already done that on this side here and
so<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.880> going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> repeat<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.840> one

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
so it is going to repeat it on this one

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.650 
so it is going to repeat it on this one
there<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.940> literally<00:03:01.940> just<00:03:02.209> gonna<00:03:02.360> take<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
there and literally just gonna take the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.840 
there and literally just gonna take the
black<00:03:02.840> wall<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.230> paint<00:03:03.350> again<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.040> you're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
black wall to paint again and you're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.320 
black wall to paint again and you're
just<00:03:05.239> gonna<00:03:05.630> more<00:03:06.019> or<00:03:06.170> less<00:03:06.820> trace<00:03:07.820> right<00:03:08.090> into

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
just gonna more or less trace right into

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.540 
just gonna more or less trace right into
the<00:03:08.450> outside<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.350> your<00:03:09.739> nostril

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:28.320 

and<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:17.240> just<00:03:17.450> build<00:03:17.720> outward<00:03:18.320> slightly

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.080 

and<00:03:28.810> again<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.350> quite<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.650> sort<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.190> pointy

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and again is quite a sort of a pointy

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.360 
and again is quite a sort of a pointy
shape<00:03:31.330> here<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.900> take<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.410> right<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.190> very

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
shape here and take it right to the very

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.570 
shape here and take it right to the very
bottom<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.150> nose<00:03:34.720> there

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.400 

so<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.270> would<00:03:43.390> give<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.600> definition<00:03:44.200> there

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
so that would give you definition there

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.580 
so that would give you definition there
and<00:03:44.710> then<00:03:45.160> we're<00:03:45.460> going<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.330> lips<00:03:46.660> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and then we're going to do the lips and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.110 
and then we're going to do the lips and
because<00:03:47.920> obviously<00:03:48.070> we're<00:03:48.460> goal<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.880> Ian's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
because obviously we're goal of Ian's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.400 
because obviously we're goal of Ian's
we're<00:03:49.390> going<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.570> make<00:03:49.690> them<00:03:49.810> pretty<00:03:49.990> rather

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
we're going to make them pretty rather

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.840 
we're going to make them pretty rather
than<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.920> line<00:03:51.100> across<00:03:51.340> which<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.730> what

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
than just the line across which is what

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.480 
than just the line across which is what
you<00:03:51.970> normally<00:03:52.120> see<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:56.380> with<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.860> we're<00:03:57.220> just

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
you normally see so with this we're just

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.550 
you normally see so with this we're just
going<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.700> literally<00:03:58.150> paint<00:03:58.570> on<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.170> shape<00:03:59.410> of

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
going to literally paint on the shape of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:08.220 
going to literally paint on the shape of
our<00:03:59.710> lips<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.330> make<00:04:07.450> them<00:04:07.630> any<00:04:07.870> shape

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
our lips and you can make them any shape

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.480 
our lips and you can make them any shape
you<00:04:08.410> want<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.800> if<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:08.980> want<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.220> really

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
you want so if you want to really

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.790 
you want so if you want to really
accentuate<00:04:09.760> them<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.270> could<00:04:10.480> or<00:04:10.870> make<00:04:11.620> them

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
accentuate them you could or make them

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:56.760 
accentuate them you could or make them
just<00:04:12.010> quite<00:04:12.310> thin<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.820> can

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.409 

and<00:04:57.310> there<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.550> go<00:04:57.669> that's<00:04:57.789> your<00:04:57.910> lips<00:04:58.210> there

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
and there you go that's your lips there

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.150 
and there you go that's your lips there
and<00:04:58.720> then<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.080> final<00:04:59.500> bit<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.830> need<00:05:00.009> to

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
and then the final bit that you need to

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.730 
and then the final bit that you need to
do<00:05:00.340> is<00:05:00.669> where<00:05:01.569> on<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:01.990> side<00:05:02.199> I've<00:05:02.319> done<00:05:02.530> like

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
do is where on this side I've done like

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.830 
do is where on this side I've done like
this<00:05:03.370> black<00:05:03.580> portion<00:05:04.090> it's<00:05:04.330> just<00:05:04.539> basically

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
this black portion it's just basically

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.540 
this black portion it's just basically
to<00:05:04.960> give<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.319> triangular<00:05:05.830> shape<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.400> face

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
to give the triangular shape to the face

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.629 
to give the triangular shape to the face
so<00:05:07.319> the<00:05:08.319> idea<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.710> if<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.949> had<00:05:09.069> your<00:05:09.250> eyes<00:05:09.370> shut

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
so the idea is if you had your eyes shut

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.550 
so the idea is if you had your eyes shut
you<00:05:09.849> would<00:05:10.030> just<00:05:10.270> like<00:05:10.599> this<00:05:10.780> triangle<00:05:11.229> with

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
you would just like this triangle with

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.499 
you would just like this triangle with
the<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:12.069> know<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.370> holes<00:05:12.789> like<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> black

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
the you know the holes like the black

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.790 
the you know the holes like the black
holes<00:05:13.720> that<00:05:13.870> they<00:05:14.020> had<00:05:14.169> for<00:05:14.349> eyes

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
holes that they had for eyes

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.830 
holes that they had for eyes
so<00:05:15.430> with<00:05:15.819> this<00:05:16.030> again<00:05:16.360> you're<00:05:16.479> just<00:05:16.539> going<00:05:16.690> to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
so with this again you're just going to

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.240 
so with this again you're just going to
use<00:05:16.990> your<00:05:17.139> water<00:05:17.259> paint<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.860> you're<00:05:17.949> just

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
use your water paint and you're just

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.589 
use your water paint and you're just
literally<00:05:18.490> going<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.819> draw<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.060> line<00:05:19.360> down

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
literally going to draw the line down

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.900 
literally going to draw the line down
the<00:05:20.590> side<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.009> face<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.699> can

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
the side of the face so that you can

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:32.710 
the side of the face so that you can
narrow<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.509> shape

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.510 

okay<00:05:33.720> so<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.170> your<00:05:34.560> finished<00:05:34.980> tutorial

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
okay so that is your finished tutorial

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.120 
okay so that is your finished tutorial

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
and the only other thing that I've done

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.410 
and the only other thing that I've done
