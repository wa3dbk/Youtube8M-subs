00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
let's talk about some ways that we can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.420 
let's talk about some ways that we can
kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.510> up<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.190> first<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.310> all

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
kind of think this up here first of all

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.240 
kind of think this up here first of all
we're<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.730> to<00:01:17.790> add<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.270> 9<00:01:18.510> notes<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.500> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
we're going to add some 9 notes in it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.469 
we're going to add some 9 notes in it
some<00:01:20.400> 9<00:01:20.550> are<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.000> notes<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
some 9 are some two notes we're going to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.070 
some 9 are some two notes we're going to
use<00:01:21.570> those<00:01:21.720> terms<00:01:21.930> interchangeably<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:24.080> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
use those terms interchangeably so it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.670 
use those terms interchangeably so it's
a<00:01:25.170> Tatooine

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
a Tatooine

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.760 
a Tatooine
so<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.340> now<00:01:27.430> becomes<00:01:27.700> an<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:27.940> court

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so this is now becomes an a to court

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.250 
so this is now becomes an a to court

us<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> de<00:02:15.360> sus<00:02:15.599> chord<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:17.099> we're<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.400> to

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
us as a de sus chord and we're going to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.809 
us as a de sus chord and we're going to
resolve<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:19.079> a<00:02:19.409> major<00:02:20.159> triad

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
resolve it to a major triad

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.850 
resolve it to a major triad
so<00:02:21.000> we've<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.329> 1<00:02:22.250> 4

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
so we've got 1 4

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.800 
so we've got 1 4
five<00:02:25.490> sus<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:27.410> was<00:02:27.560> resolved

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
five sus and then was resolved

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
five sus and then was resolved
ah<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.770> we're<00:02:30.890> sort<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> find<00:02:31.280> some<00:02:31.370> more<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> lot

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
ah so we're sort of find some more a lot

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.430 
ah so we're sort of find some more a lot
more<00:02:31.819> interesting<00:02:32.540> stuff<00:02:33.020> within<00:02:33.319> these

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
more interesting stuff within these

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.010 
more interesting stuff within these
triads<00:02:33.830> here<00:02:34.120> let's<00:02:35.120> talk<00:02:35.330> about<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.750> same

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
triads here let's talk about that same

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.660 
triads here let's talk about that same
thing<00:02:36.050> kind<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.590> dressing<00:02:37.190> these<00:02:37.280> tribes<00:02:37.520> up

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
thing kind of dressing these tribes up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.930 
thing kind of dressing these tribes up
in<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.880> position

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
in this position

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.040 
in this position
so<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:42.150> let's<00:02:43.150> add<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.720> nine<00:02:44.020> in<00:02:44.200> there

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
so this is one let's add a nine in there

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.530 
so this is one let's add a nine in there
biscuit<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.860> gives<00:02:47.040> us<00:02:47.160> what's<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.240> three

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
biscuit that gives us what's this three

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020 
biscuit that gives us what's this three
five<00:02:48.900> nine

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.700 

let's<00:02:51.930> do<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> 4-quart<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.490> 4<00:02:53.700> chord<00:02:54.710> we're

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
let's do a 4-quart for our 4 chord we're

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.200 
let's do a 4-quart for our 4 chord we're
going<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.860> do<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.100> same<00:02:56.370> shape<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.820> did<00:02:57.030> down

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
going to do that same shape we did down

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.699 
going to do that same shape we did down
here

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
here

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.039 
here
we're<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.189> gonna<00:02:59.310> slide<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.840> a

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
we're just gonna slide it up this is a

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.259 
we're just gonna slide it up this is a
four<00:03:01.379> two<00:03:01.620> quarts<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.099> then<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.909> can't<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
four two quarts so then this can't be a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.640 
four two quarts so then this can't be a
d2

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
d2

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.289 
d2
and<00:03:05.769> then<00:03:06.250> we're<00:03:06.340> gonna<00:03:06.459> get<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.640> five<00:03:06.940> suss

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
and then we're gonna get a five suss

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.330 
and then we're gonna get a five suss
again<00:03:07.599> so<00:03:08.140> instead<00:03:08.379> of<00:03:08.440> our<00:03:08.560> major<00:03:09.129> we're

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
again so instead of our major we're

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.690 
again so instead of our major we're
gonna<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.670> mattiece<00:03:10.060> us<00:03:10.480> snow<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.400> gives

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
gonna be mattiece us snow so that gives

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.100 
gonna be mattiece us snow so that gives
us<00:03:12.879> what<00:03:13.629> five<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.620> four<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:16.180> then<00:03:16.930> let's

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
us what five one and four and then let's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.300 
us what five one and four and then let's
resolve<00:03:17.379> this<00:03:17.560> us

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
resolve this us

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.490 
resolve this us
and<00:03:20.300> take<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.690> straight<00:03:20.930> major<00:03:21.140> triad

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
and take it to a straight major triad

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:30.180 
and take it to a straight major triad
and<00:03:21.800> we<00:03:22.490> have<00:03:22.670> one<00:03:24.670> four<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.980> five

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.130 

fine<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:34.600> for

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
fine so what for

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.190 
fine so what for
what

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.949 

so<00:03:45.130> hopefully<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:46.060> gets<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.480> get<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
so hopefully that that gets you get you

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.660 
so hopefully that that gets you get you
started<00:03:47.260> thinking<00:03:47.500> about<00:03:47.830> how<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:47.980> dress<00:03:48.430> up

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
started thinking about how to dress up

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.760 
started thinking about how to dress up
these<00:03:49.080> simple<00:03:50.080> triads

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.470 

it<00:03:54.370> should<00:03:54.640> get<00:03:54.790> your<00:03:54.940> point<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.270> in<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
it should get your point in the in the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.540 
it should get your point in the in the
right<00:03:55.600> direction<00:03:55.780> at<00:03:56.110> least<00:03:56.160> if<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.340> have

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
right direction at least if you have

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.800 
right direction at least if you have
more<00:03:57.790> questions<00:03:57.850> about<00:03:58.420> about<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.740> nine

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
more questions about about the nine

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.210 
more questions about about the nine
adding<00:04:01.810> nines<00:04:02.050> into<00:04:02.560> courts<00:04:02.890> there's<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.070> lot

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
adding nines into courts there's a lot

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.600 
adding nines into courts there's a lot
of<00:04:03.340> stuff<00:04:03.490> on<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.820> site<00:04:04.120> about<00:04:05.020> that<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:06.580> just

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
of stuff on this site about that so just

be sure to search it and check that

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.380 
be sure to search it and check that
category<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.550> reason<00:04:09.760> why<00:04:09.880> we<00:04:10.000> write<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> lot

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
category the reason why we write a lot

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.810 
category the reason why we write a lot
about<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:11.170> because<00:04:11.410> it's<00:04:11.890> important

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
about it is because it's important

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.310 
about it is because it's important
that's<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.030> really<00:04:13.510> easy<00:04:13.660> note<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:14.080> add<00:04:14.200> the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
that's a really easy note to add the

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.930 
that's a really easy note to add the
course<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.590> make<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:15.040> more<00:04:15.220> interesting<00:04:15.640> and

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
course to make it more interesting and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.250 
course to make it more interesting and
again<00:04:16.090> that's<00:04:16.270> what<00:04:16.420> that's<00:04:16.750> what<00:04:16.900> guitar

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
again that's what that's what guitar

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
again that's what that's what guitar
