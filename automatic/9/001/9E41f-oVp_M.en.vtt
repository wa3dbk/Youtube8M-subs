00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.909 

another<00:05:08.720> interesting<00:05:09.050> feature<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.590> this

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
another interesting feature of this

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.040 
another interesting feature of this
guitar<00:05:10.129> is<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.669> I<00:05:11.860> think<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:12.979> with<00:05:13.129> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
guitar is that I think that with the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.990 
guitar is that I think that with the
right<00:05:15.050> type<00:05:15.289> of<00:05:15.319> overdrive<00:05:15.889> box<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.729> really

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
right type of overdrive box and I really

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.570 
right type of overdrive box and I really
like<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:18.020> AC<00:05:18.259> booster<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.800> lot<00:05:19.009> because<00:05:19.190> once

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
like this AC booster a lot because once

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.279 
like this AC booster a lot because once
again<00:05:19.819> it's<00:05:19.940> very<00:05:20.000> organic<00:05:20.750> is<00:05:20.870> very<00:05:21.080> very

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
again it's very organic is very very

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.930 
again it's very organic is very very
touch<00:05:21.530> sensitive<00:05:22.099> but<00:05:22.849> you<00:05:23.000> can<00:05:23.259> really<00:05:24.940> sort

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
touch sensitive but you can really sort

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.330 
touch sensitive but you can really sort
of<00:05:26.000> dig<00:05:26.300> in<00:05:26.539> a<00:05:26.870> lot<00:05:27.289> with<00:05:27.530> these<00:05:27.710> pickups<00:05:28.129> and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
of dig in a lot with these pickups and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.129 
of dig in a lot with these pickups and

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
yet if you just back off of the picking

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.540 
yet if you just back off of the picking
a<00:05:30.229> little<00:05:30.440> bit<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.860> sound<00:05:31.099> just<00:05:31.280> really

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
a little bit the sound just really

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.180
