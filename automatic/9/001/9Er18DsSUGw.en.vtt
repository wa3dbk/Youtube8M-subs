we went down 21 and oh and then we

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.750 
we went down 21 and oh and then we
switched<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.560> spawns<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:57.250> them<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.519> actually

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
switched to spawns on them and actually

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.120 
switched to spawns on them and actually
beat<00:03:58.209> them<00:03:58.419> by<00:03:58.599> eight<00:03:58.900> or<00:03:58.959> nine<00:03:59.380> kills<00:03:59.769> toward

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
like that you know where you pretty much

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.759 
like that you know where you pretty much
can<00:04:06.400> dominate<00:04:06.790> dictating<00:04:07.690> also<00:04:08.530> think<00:04:08.739> that

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
can dominate dictating also think that

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.180 
can dominate dictating also think that
you're<00:04:09.040> used<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:11.470> what<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.829> is<00:04:11.859> you

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
finally get what you used to and you can

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.509 
finally get what you used to and you can

Butthead came out the f2000 wasn't that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.470 
Butthead came out the f2000 wasn't that
bad<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:44.150> wasn't<00:04:44.360> that<00:04:44.570> bad<00:04:44.780> because<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:46.480> it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
bad and it wasn't that bad because it it

bad and it wasn't that bad because it it
was<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.140> FAMAS<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.740> pretty<00:04:49.160> much<00:04:49.280> was

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
was just the FAMAS that pretty much was

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.190 
was just the FAMAS that pretty much was
what<00:04:49.670> it<00:04:49.790> was<00:04:49.820> but<00:04:50.450> compared<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:50.930> shit<00:04:51.170> like

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
what it was but compared to shit like

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.460 
what it was but compared to shit like
the<00:04:51.440> ACR<00:04:51.920> mod<00:04:52.190> war<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:52.490> -<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:53.420> was<00:04:53.540> horrible

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
the ACR mod war for - it was horrible

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.630 
the ACR mod war for - it was horrible
