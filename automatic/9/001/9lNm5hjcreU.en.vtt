00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.920 
these motors what I'm having issues with
I<00:00:33.149> found<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.100> temporary<00:00:35.100> solution<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.660> right

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I found a temporary solution to is right

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
I found a temporary solution to is right
there<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:38.100> usually<00:00:38.309> sit

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
there and they usually sit

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.850 
there and they usually sit
you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.140> beyond<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> manifold<00:00:41.520> there

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
you know just beyond the manifold there

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
you know just beyond the manifold there
so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.960> don't<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.110> y'all<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so I don't know if y'all could see that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
so I don't know if y'all could see that

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
does right here it will go down in there

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.720 
does right here it will go down in there
but<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.880> top<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.389> will<00:02:51.510> cover<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.870> hole<00:02:52.730> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
but the top of it will cover the hole it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.460 
but the top of it will cover the hole it
will<00:02:53.850> still<00:02:54.030> leak<00:02:54.329> just<00:02:54.600> about<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> drop<00:02:55.139> or<00:02:55.319> two
