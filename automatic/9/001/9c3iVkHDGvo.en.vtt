00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.410
 more internationals without just have to come much more 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.119

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.170
 We do not mean that anyone knows something good, but if not yet 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.310
 Okay, but let's assume that Sun Melbourne's first big one 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.940
 Play tournament 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.730
 Opportunities used 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 what do you think of the overall preparation of the team in%? 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.780
 and also from g personally 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.530

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.150
 only rich and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.690

 more and want to be as far as possible and for me to come 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.750
 personally it is a huge chance 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.920
 and yes Violetta I use and be there 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.320
 As the guessers your chances of being a loser they probably go as far as possible 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.350
 that is clearly acquired, how realistic it may be 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 Wallaus Treppchen to come after two fourth places now in 2006 and 2008 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 yes the preliminary round with Sweden Ukraine and the Netherlands 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.780
 St was not quite feasible while not having much luck and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.350
 yes a second round from the Norwegians to Werner possible and France 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.750
 we have to play really well but the chance is there to do so 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 Wanted Cup against Hungary still just lost and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.180
 yes, when we act as a team and um 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.000
 every one fighting for each one he can come a long way 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.620
