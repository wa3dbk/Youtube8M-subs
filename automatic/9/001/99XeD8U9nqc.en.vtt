00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.670
 all I hope you are well 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.200
 today I 'm going to introduce you to my 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.090
 new animals it's two 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.320
 wavy parakeets 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.550
 so we link to the green that's here that 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.140
 isis is called and blue is azure 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.230
 so I really wanted to apologize for 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 the lack of video but I had my 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.690
 second white patent and history of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.220
 arts of football not really make 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.520
 videos or reply to your comments 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.199
 that really excuse me 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.000
 So here is the green and my phone 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:41.059
 I wanted to show are the bars the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.799
 So here it must be a two 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.210
 weeks we have them here we are azure who 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.809
 is mine but good concert that both 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.809
 are still ours 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.329
 so we got them from a breeder in 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.250
 actually they were on the right corner so 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.719
 is not basically you breeders or 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.359
 nothing is a job next to it all 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.159
 he just had that he had some 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.989
 breeding males and females but 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.840
 that's not at all something 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.820
 of intense ifni nothing so here they 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.049
 have put me so and the blue he did not 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 still molted here it is not at all 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.119
 seems definitive and I think the berd 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 will change a little bit too 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.630
 So here it is a couple so here is 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.159
 so I quickly introduce you to the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.250
 cage at the same time so it's a cage 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.610
 we had on the right corner so here we go 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.229
 which is how we are she is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.810
 so composed of a play like that so 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.619
 in fact we are the cage for 60 euros 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.409
 with this accessory there and the sticks 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.119
 talk about records so the big 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.110
 perch is wood against the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.970
 others it's not wood so that's 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.830
 really bad it was sold to us 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.060
 with so there are three small ones 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.000
 books here one who is there is one who there 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.940
 is here so otherwise the bowls that's it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.920
 we who added them the same bone 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.890
 cuttlefish is what we added having 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 played also that we added with a 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 little bell whose golden visa biting 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.099
 above then so that's a 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.500
 candy bar 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.560
 but honestly he does not eat it and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.730
 did we get it as a gift with the bag 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.840
 of seeds so in fact I 'm not going to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.980
 all of them buy them as for the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.690
 guinea pigs I do not want any age 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.190
 and industrial treats but as 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.660
 it's with jelly mimics anyway 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.019
 when you see they have not at all 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.129
 eat then so here we are there is a 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.849
 cover on the front like that and he 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.500
 does not have another below we see we do not 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.480
 lu tiercÃ© of soft corn cobs and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.470
 they have some toys and here actually 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.879
 it's their bath either and that 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.860
 birds do not like to go downstairs because 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.750
 that he does not feel safe at all 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.220
 but we do not have an opening word 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.080
 in fact on the cage you have to hand over 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.090
 a bench in height you can put it 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.340
 downstairs and they 've already banished themselves 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.069
 I am super happy 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 no it's you understood actually open 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.489
 to clean like that so that's so 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.989
 there as it is nice in fact they are at 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.819
 outside then like that they can 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.719
 talk with other birds they 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.720
 can look at what's at 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.920
 outdoors 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.570
 soon we will put them inside 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.210
 so that I can make them fly in 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.040
 a room where we held for us 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.120
 just waiting who were inviting us because 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.540
 that in fact we will put the cage 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.530
 it's near the guest room and the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.820
 blow they will make noise of which 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.590
 the origin is so wrong and just put 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.930
 after but I think we're going to the end 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.150
 is a little summer out in small 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.310
 flap merlin toki enjoy the sun from 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.050
 teor so here's the twitter thread yet 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.180
 that it obliges to the tame to eat there 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.200
 in the hand we can caress them 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.750
 go in our hand is below 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.810
 really happy 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.840
 So here we are, mahut grass at 60 euros 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.940
 and the birds we had we had 20 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.320
 euros for the next shot here I am 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:52.320
 I'm really happy to have seen them play 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:53.670
 the counters or too cute daddy so 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.140
 this is almost surely 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.540
 so videos about Parma birds on 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 feeding all that and also on the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.770
 all I will teach you that I have 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.390
 already started actually learning on 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.890
 will say our cellars xa so with 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 brewed all that he's ready and then the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.100
 remove branches all that so that's 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.930
 great fun to see 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.769
 it's really super cute and so 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.170
 here I think that would do 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.580
 videos about my birds 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.989
 so here is my comment if you 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.380
 want to listen to the first a video 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.380
 kisses
