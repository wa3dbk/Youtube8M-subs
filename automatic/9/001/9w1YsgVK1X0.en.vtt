young<00:00:37.270> mayor<00:00:37.510> which<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.930> did<00:00:38.140> not<00:00:38.170> predict<00:00:38.620> to

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
young mayor which I did not predict to

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.290 
young mayor which I did not predict to
be<00:00:38.829> honest<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.280> thought<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.760> would<00:00:39.879> lead<00:00:40.059> over

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
be honest I thought it would lead over

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.670 
be honest I thought it would lead over
that<00:00:40.449> doctor<00:00:40.809> or<00:00:40.930> something<00:00:41.079> like<00:00:41.260> that<00:00:41.320> I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
that doctor or something like that I

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.340 
that doctor or something like that I
really<00:00:42.430> had<00:00:42.699> some<00:00:43.809> was<00:00:43.960> in<00:00:44.079> mind

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
really had some was in mind

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.439 
really had some was in mind
instead<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.430> Jamaica<00:00:45.789> but<00:00:45.969> I<00:00:46.030> guess<00:00:46.239> it

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
instead of the Jamaica but I guess it

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.910 
instead of the Jamaica but I guess it
makes<00:00:46.600> sense<00:00:46.719> because<00:00:47.050> he<00:00:47.350> just<00:00:47.500> wants<00:00:47.800> to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
makes sense because he just wants to

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.580 
makes sense because he just wants to
push<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.340> sleep<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:49.059> start<00:00:49.930> protecting<00:00:50.320> all

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
push it a sleep and start protecting all

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.840 
push it a sleep and start protecting all
the<00:00:50.710> time<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.250> get<00:00:51.340> his<00:00:51.460> people

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
the time just to get his people

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.759 
the time just to get his people
something<00:00:52.149> like<00:00:52.359> that<00:00:52.570> that's<00:00:53.530> what<00:00:53.680> I<00:00:53.710> that's

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
something like that that's what I that's

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.439 
something like that that's what I that's
what<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.309> was<00:00:54.340> my<00:00:54.640> guess<00:00:54.699> at<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.149> beginning

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
what that was my guess at the beginning

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.819 
what that was my guess at the beginning
of<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.629> game<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:56.019> I'm<00:00:56.170> gonna<00:00:56.350> go<00:00:56.559> ahead<00:00:56.590> and

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
of the game so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.340 
of the game so I'm gonna go ahead and
set<00:00:57.100> up<00:00:57.129> still<00:00:57.399> runs<00:00:57.670> as<00:00:57.850> he<00:00:58.600> tries<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.840> put<00:00:59.199> me

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
set up still runs as he tries to put me

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.860 
set up still runs as he tries to put me
asleep<00:00:59.620> with<00:00:59.890> hypnosis<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:00.489> at<00:01:00.760> mrs.<00:01:01.179> I'm

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the 252 into 121 or something like that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.600 
the 252 into 121 or something like that

i don't even remember how much it was

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.330 
i don't even remember how much it was
but<00:02:52.640> i<00:02:53.000> actually<00:02:53.810> split<00:02:54.200> those<00:02:54.380> v's<00:02:54.950> into<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
but i actually split those v's into the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.740 
but i actually split those v's into the
fans<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.670> special<00:02:55.970> defense<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.420> was<00:02:56.540> very

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
there's if he wasn't faster than my

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.839

taurus<00:04:42.380> which<00:04:42.919> kind<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.220> makes<00:04:43.370> sense<00:04:43.610> because

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
taurus which kind of makes sense because

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.760

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
there is no way in hell that the crawler

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.080 
there is no way in hell that the crawler
can<00:04:46.009> become<00:04:46.370> faster<00:04:46.849> than<00:04:47.229> 350<00:04:48.639> speed<00:04:49.639> out<00:04:50.030> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
can become faster than 350 speed out of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.240 
can become faster than 350 speed out of
nowhere<00:04:50.539> with<00:04:50.900> only<00:04:51.110> one<00:04:51.380> friggin<00:04:51.680> dance<00:04:51.889> so<00:04:52.220> I
