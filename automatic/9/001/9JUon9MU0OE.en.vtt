00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
just touching a part of the body what I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.190 
just touching a part of the body what I
can<00:02:34.579> get<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.940> reaction<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.540> snap<00:02:35.810> out<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.019> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
can get the reaction of snap out of it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.660 
can get the reaction of snap out of it
because<00:02:36.709> most<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.069> time<00:02:37.220> what<00:02:37.340> people<00:02:37.370> do

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
because most of the time what people do

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.280 
because most of the time what people do
is<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:38.000> pull<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.569> dog<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.930> start<00:02:39.110> scream

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
reason why this breed gets in trouble is

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.670 
reason why this breed gets in trouble is
because<00:02:50.269> people<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:51.019> know<00:02:51.079> how<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.319> snap

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
because people don't know how to snap

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.000 
because people don't know how to snap
the<00:02:52.280> breed<00:02:52.549> out<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.879> it
