00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
the jacket this fabric right here like I

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.140 
the jacket this fabric right here like I
said<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.160> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> spandex

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
said it's a little bit of a spandex

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.030 
said it's a little bit of a spandex
property<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.560> there's<00:01:43.860> something

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
property to it and there's something

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.790 
property to it and there's something
different<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.780> ill-informed<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.650> my

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
different here in the ill-informed so my

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.550 
different here in the ill-informed so my
guess<00:01:46.980> is<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.430> more<00:01:47.730> resilient

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
guess is that's just more resilient

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.290 
guess is that's just more resilient
