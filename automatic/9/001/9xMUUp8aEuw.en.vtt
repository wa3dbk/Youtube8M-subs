today to show you what I'm doing with my
original<00:00:07.730> hydroponic<00:00:08.730> system<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.389> had<00:00:09.420> set<00:00:09.870> up

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
original hydroponic system I had set up

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.089 
original hydroponic system I had set up
a<00:00:10.250> flood<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.460> drain<00:00:11.900> table<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.170> originally<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
a flood and drain table and originally I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.599 
a flood and drain table and originally I
was<00:00:14.519> floating<00:00:15.560> styrofoam<00:00:16.560> rafts<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
was floating styrofoam rafts with the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
was floating styrofoam rafts with the
lettuce<00:00:17.940> growing<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.960> wasn't<00:00:19.439> happy

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
lettuce growing in it I wasn't happy

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
lettuce growing in it I wasn't happy
with<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.580> amount<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:21.060> space<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.480> each<00:00:22.080> plant

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
with the amount of space that each plant

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.210 
with the amount of space that each plant
could<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> yields<00:00:25.350> were<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:26.010> too

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
could get and the yields were just too

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.519 
could get and the yields were just too
low<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:27.000> I'm<00:00:27.119> trying<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.810> selling<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
low for what I'm trying to do selling to

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
low for what I'm trying to do selling to
the<00:00:28.650> restaurant<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:30.119> why<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> switched

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the restaurant so that's why I switched

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.290 
the restaurant so that's why I switched
over<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.650> nft<00:00:32.219> system<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> could<00:00:33.120> grow<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
over to the nft system so I could grow a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080 
over to the nft system so I could grow a
lot<00:00:33.480> more<00:00:33.660> plants<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.610> didn't<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
lot more plants but I didn't want the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
lot more plants but I didn't want the
system<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> waste<00:00:37.050> invested<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
system to go to waste invested a lot of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.720 
system to go to waste invested a lot of
money<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.879> time<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.020> built<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.040> by

filtering out the waste from the bed

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.130 
filtering out the waste from the bed
also<00:02:04.510> i'm<00:02:04.810> going<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.590> put<00:02:05.950> worms<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.810> grow

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
also i'm going to put worms in the grow

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.190 
also i'm going to put worms in the grow
bed<00:02:08.350> itself<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.220> they'll<00:02:09.430> actually<00:02:09.640> eat<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
bed itself and they'll actually eat the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.490 
bed itself and they'll actually eat the
expired<00:02:12.090> roots<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.960> i<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.260> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
expired roots so that i don't have to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
expired roots so that i don't have to
spend<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:14.830> much<00:02:15.010> time<00:02:15.070> cleaning<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.940> bed<00:02:16.090> out

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
spend as much time cleaning the bed out

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.100 
spend as much time cleaning the bed out
in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> future<00:02:17.610> i'm<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.210> start<00:02:19.750> with

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
in the future i'm going to start with

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.860 
in the future i'm going to start with
tilapia<00:02:21.390> probably<00:02:22.390> do<00:02:23.370> 20<00:02:24.370> tilapia<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.510> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
tilapia probably do 20 tilapia in this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.440 
tilapia probably do 20 tilapia in this
hundred<00:02:26.440> gallon<00:02:27.190> tank<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:27.760> i<00:02:27.790> don't<00:02:28.120> over

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
hundred gallon tank so i don't over

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110 
hundred gallon tank so i don't over
stress<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.990> fish<00:02:29.230> i<00:02:29.560> need<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.310> really<00:02:30.700> take

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
stress the fish i need to really take

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.790 
stress the fish i need to really take
some<00:02:31.330> time<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.780> figure<00:02:31.930> out<00:02:32.230> what<00:02:32.440> i'm<00:02:32.560> going

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
some time to figure out what i'm going

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.790 
some time to figure out what i'm going
to<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.370> far<00:02:33.640> as<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:35.080> know<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> ratio<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
to do as far as you know the ratio of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.660 
to do as far as you know the ratio of
fish<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.970> plants<00:02:37.720> new<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.010> aquaponics

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
fish to plants new to this aquaponics

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.970 
fish to plants new to this aquaponics
setup<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.390> i'm<00:02:41.080> gonna<00:02:41.230> take<00:02:41.410> some<00:02:41.590> time<00:02:41.650> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
setup so i'm gonna take some time to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.900 
setup so i'm gonna take some time to
learn<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.370> before<00:02:42.550> i<00:02:42.820> try<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:44.070> upscale<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
learn it before i try to upscale it to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.540 
learn it before i try to upscale it to
commercial<00:02:46.510> business<00:02:46.960> right<00:02:47.800> now<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.950> filled

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
commercial business right now I filled

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.840 
commercial business right now I filled
the<00:02:49.480> gap<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.110> reservoir<00:02:50.710> with<00:02:51.100> 100<00:02:51.550> gallons

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the gap the reservoir with 100 gallons

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.450 
the gap the reservoir with 100 gallons
of<00:02:51.970> water<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.450> said<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.590> bubblers

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
of water like I said and the bubblers

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.390 
of water like I said and the bubblers
air<00:02:54.910> stones<00:02:55.330> are<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.720> there<00:02:56.250> providing<00:02:57.250> oxygen

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
air stones are in there providing oxygen

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.570 
air stones are in there providing oxygen
and<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.330> guess<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> wait<00:02:59.020> 30<00:02:59.380> days<00:02:59.590> for

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
and I guess I have to wait 30 days for

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.390 
and I guess I have to wait 30 days for
the<00:03:00.910> nitrates<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.870> convert<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the nitrates to convert all of the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.330 
the nitrates to convert all of the
ammonia<00:03:03.880> out<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.900> water<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:06.130> I'll

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
ammonia out of the water and then I'll

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.820 
ammonia out of the water and then I'll
be<00:03:06.730> able<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.150> put<00:03:07.330> my<00:03:07.510> fish<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.350> they<00:03:08.590> won't

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
be able to put my fish in and they won't

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.020 
be able to put my fish in and they won't
find<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> water<00:03:10.060> toxic<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.850> hoping<00:03:12.850> like

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
find the water toxic and hoping like

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.130 
find the water toxic and hoping like
after<00:03:13.450> about<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.720> week<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.450> fish<00:03:16.660> being<00:03:16.959> in

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
after about a week of the fish being in

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.020 
after about a week of the fish being in
the<00:03:17.230> system<00:03:17.560> i'm<00:03:17.800> going<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.130> start<00:03:18.310> growing

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the system i'm going to start growing

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.360 
the system i'm going to start growing
plants<00:03:19.570> i'll<00:03:20.020> probably<00:03:20.230> start<00:03:20.770> cycling<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
plants i'll probably start cycling the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.770 
plants i'll probably start cycling the
water<00:03:21.550> through<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.850> grow<00:03:22.030> bed<00:03:22.209> before<00:03:22.390> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
water through the grow bed before that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.930 
water through the grow bed before that
just<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.170> fill<00:03:23.440> throughout<00:03:23.709> them<00:03:23.950> waste<00:03:24.640> from

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
just to fill throughout them waste from

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640 
just to fill throughout them waste from
the<00:03:25.000> fish<00:03:25.330> but<00:03:25.959> then<00:03:26.080> i'm<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.380> start<00:03:26.530> my

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
the fish but then i'm going to start my

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.420 
the fish but then i'm going to start my
plants<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.310> i<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.650> thousand-watt<00:03:29.650> grow

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
plants and i have a thousand-watt grow

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.760 
plants and i have a thousand-watt grow
light<00:03:30.700> right<00:03:31.000> now<00:03:31.180> I've<00:03:31.600> got<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:32.140> metal

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
light right now I've got the metal

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.580 
light right now I've got the metal
halide<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:34.390> starting<00:03:34.840> my<00:03:34.870> plants<00:03:35.350> i<00:03:35.410> think

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
halide in for starting my plants i think

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.979 
halide in for starting my plants i think
i'm<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.860> grow<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.400> tomatoes<00:03:36.880> and

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
i'm going to grow some tomatoes and

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.320 
i'm going to grow some tomatoes and
basil<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.860> lettuce<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.400> an<00:03:39.580> arugula<00:03:39.850> but<00:03:40.300> i

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
basil and lettuce is an arugula but i

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.070 
basil and lettuce is an arugula but i
also<00:03:40.600> am<00:03:40.900> really<00:03:40.930> excited<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:42.010> try<00:03:42.040> some

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
also am really excited to try some

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.560 
also am really excited to try some
radishes<00:03:44.080> i<00:03:44.320> love<00:03:44.830> radishes<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:46.120> seen<00:03:46.540> that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
radishes i love radishes and I seen that

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.500 
radishes i love radishes and I seen that
you<00:03:46.840> can<00:03:47.080> grow<00:03:47.380> radishes<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.030> expanded

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
you can grow radishes in the expanded

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.350 
you can grow radishes in the expanded
clay<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.830> grows<00:03:51.010> pretty<00:03:51.280> well<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:51.970> can't

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
clay and it grows pretty well so I can't

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.530 
clay and it grows pretty well so I can't
wait<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.570> see<00:03:52.780> how<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.080> goes<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:54.640> just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
wait to see how that goes but just

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.780 
wait to see how that goes but just
giving<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.930> an<00:03:56.050> update<00:03:56.230> see<00:03:57.220> what's<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.700> on

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
giving you an update see what's going on

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.390 
giving you an update see what's going on
and<00:03:58.180> i'll<00:03:58.870> get<00:03:59.230> back<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.769> when<00:04:00.010> I've<00:04:00.160> got

and i'll get back to you when I've got

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.769 
and i'll get back to you when I've got
plants<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:00.970> system<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.450> fish<00:04:01.690> can't<00:04:02.590> wait
