shaft motor the four-stroke with the CDI
ignition<00:00:09.170> why<00:00:10.170> some<00:00:10.440> parts<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.860> came<00:00:11.010> off

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
ignition why some parts of it came off

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.270 
ignition why some parts of it came off
of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.490> 1983<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.019> basically<00:00:13.590> had<00:00:14.040> two

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of the 1983 so I basically had two

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.910 
of the 1983 so I basically had two
engines<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.330> built<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.680> two

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
engines and I built one out of the two

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.990 
engines and I built one out of the two
had<00:00:17.400> enough<00:00:17.640> parts<00:00:18.439> just<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.939> go<00:00:20.939> ahead

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
had enough parts just to do one go ahead

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
had enough parts just to do one go ahead
and<00:00:21.119> walk<00:00:21.270> around<00:00:21.420> look<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:23.160> four-stroke

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and walk around look at the four-stroke

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.870 
and walk around look at the four-stroke
motor<00:00:23.699> which<00:00:24.570> means<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.960> takes<00:00:25.609> regular<00:00:26.609> fuel

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
motor which means it takes regular fuel

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
motor which means it takes regular fuel
just<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.510> car<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:28.619> forward<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
just like your car got forward and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.280 
just like your car got forward and
reverse<00:00:29.840> it's<00:00:30.840> also<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> 12<00:00:32.040> volt<00:00:33.290> supply

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

new<00:00:58.770> water<00:00:58.949> pump<00:01:00.500> like<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.620> said<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> motors

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
new water pump like I said the motors

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.960 
new water pump like I said the motors
were<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.789> completely<00:01:03.539> apart<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
were in completely apart so I had to

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
were in completely apart so I had to
figure<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> build<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.260> whole<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
figure out and build the whole thing you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
figure out and build the whole thing you
know<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.580> everything's<00:01:09.060> brand<00:01:09.330> new<00:01:09.510> went

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
know so everything's brand new went

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640 
know so everything's brand new went
through<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.619> head<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.750> perfect<00:01:12.750> new

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
through the head so it's all perfect new

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.929 
through the head so it's all perfect new
head<00:01:13.890> gasket<00:01:15.680> reset<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> valves<00:01:17.220> reset

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
head gasket reset all the valves reset

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
head gasket reset all the valves reset
the<00:01:18.060> timing<00:01:18.540> I've<00:01:19.140> got<00:01:19.350> two<00:01:19.560> belts<00:01:19.799> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the timing I've got two belts so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.929 
the timing I've got two belts so
there'll<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.970> extra<00:01:21.299> belt<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
there'll be an extra belt to go with it

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.640 
there'll be an extra belt to go with it
had<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.180> redo<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> carburetor<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.350> clean

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
had to do redo the carburetor we clean

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
had to do redo the carburetor we clean
it<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.009> everything<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:27.570> new

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it out and everything and put new

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.399 
it out and everything and put new
gaskets<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> intake<00:01:28.590> manifold<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:30.409> also

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
gaskets on the intake manifold I also

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.660 
gaskets on the intake manifold I also
want<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> decide<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:33.799> put<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> new<00:01:34.979> gasket<00:01:35.009> on

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
want to decide to put a new gasket on

want to decide to put a new gasket on
this<00:01:37.220> dipstick<00:01:38.220> housing<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.140> cylinder

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this dipstick housing the two cylinder

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
this dipstick housing the two cylinder
motor<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:42.119> 10<00:01:42.329> horsepower<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.140> they

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
motor about 10 horsepower I think they

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
motor about 10 horsepower I think they
rated<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.649> nine<00:01:43.890> point<00:01:44.220> nine<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:45.329> fuel

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rated at nine point nine there's fuel

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
rated at nine point nine there's fuel
pump<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.729> put<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> cover<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> get

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pump there put the cover back on and get

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
pump there put the cover back on and get
it<00:01:48.930> started

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.209 

this<00:01:52.479> is<00:01:52.659> probably<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.320> easiest<00:01:53.350> motor<00:01:54.070> in

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
this is probably the easiest motor in

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.830 
this is probably the easiest motor in
the<00:01:54.310> world<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.789> start<00:01:55.060> because<00:01:55.299> everything<00:01:55.719> is

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the world to start because everything is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.559 
the world to start because everything is
perfect<00:01:56.350> on<00:01:56.530> it<00:02:02.460> girl<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.729> starch<00:02:04.060> assets

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
perfect on it girl in starch assets

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.539 
perfect on it girl in starch assets
because<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.020> just<00:02:05.409> pulled<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:05.860> nicely

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
because it just pulled so nicely

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.240 
because it just pulled so nicely
make<00:02:06.759> sure<00:02:06.939> it's<00:02:07.060> pumped<00:02:08.019> up<00:02:08.170> it's<00:02:09.129> already

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
make sure it's pumped up it's already

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.830 
make sure it's pumped up it's already
warmed<00:02:09.729> up<00:02:09.879> so<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.119> won't<00:02:10.330> need<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.509> use<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
warmed up so I won't need to use the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.250 
warmed up so I won't need to use the
