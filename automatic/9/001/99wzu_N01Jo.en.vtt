00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.899
 hi to all and welcome to the techno scene has come to berlin for a 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.530
 times the big video technology show will talk about Islam now the 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.050
 design is everywhere in this salon besides saint-jerome what I have 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.769
 did it because they understood what we are talking about design and then I say that it 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.139
 who is there I'll see her good morning miss 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.820
 I think I'll come back here 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.660
 what the previous month however this date no it's because I 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.080
 do not understand the mans so it's a little complicated that he was ready for a rate 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 even if little 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.619
 explore new trends in quality design 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.860
 with the horse gears and survivors of the combined dvd recorder 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.650
 hd 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.930
 so yes we will talk about design and we said everywhere in this show must say 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 today 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.089
 design is one of the main shopping motives for consumers 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.920
 long before the technology for builders report efforts 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 for all devices 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 and we see that right away 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.040
 the notion of home integration design and essential televisions 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.909
 in the household 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.059
 it's all the more important now that at a distance 3 2 in couple 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.149
 the man and the woman the consumer does not know to cost him more and more 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.600
 it is to know what he lives in this world 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.659
 very complicated multimedia and mitis connectivity at yamaha la 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.810
 trend has remained on the tradition of the brand since its inception it's from 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.900
 stay on a sober and minimalist German and designer 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.130
 so that they are temporal and we can not get tired of a TV 9 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 hours when you buy it and when the boy has been home for a long time 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.649
 some consumers compared to the multi who can miss 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.939
 will be cooking kids or other places of activities I'm looking to have 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.840
 differentiating products color cost terms while keeping any 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.329
 the technology inside that's why we are launching a range of 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.039
 monitors from 17 to 23 inches which controls this different color a 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.039
 little pasteurized that we can use according to his tastes and interests 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.530
 so yesterday the design that actually buy themselves 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.680
 indeed if the materials m the one you see behind you and that comes out 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.400
 month 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.729
 to a lot of brushed aluminum and glass are more materials yesterday is 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.989
 more difficult to work 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 this set hastily and it will go out full next door in the vicinity 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.049
 from 23000 euros 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.370
 for it is much more expensive than a TV and proclaiming his home theater 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 normal it's really far from having cali design of it 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.119
 so what we also see are TVs its edge anyway 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.999
 TVs with the screen tile that goes all the way to a 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.389
 moment to the brim it's used to what 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.879
 art is first 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.139
 technology content with TVs a new slab and 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.309
 who will fill years 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:47.249
 comma ap centimeters 5 thick so very narrow but 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.519
 it is especially a comfort of aestheticism when the apparatus is extinguished it is a 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.089
 huge mirror 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.549
 or the fact that one does not measure at all and the screen where is the end of 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.629
 the screen and when it's on and the picture is very very close to 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.049
 edges 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.170
 which makes us dive into the environment in the image in the 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.169
 dream edenred the consumption of television 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.959
 other inevitable area of ​​design is obviously all that they 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.829
 are the speakers and I still wanted a little to introduce you the 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.800
 first bling-bling speakers present 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.820
 here in berlin hamburg north of this ifa these are pregnant harman kardon% 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.790
 olivier explain my little bit why these speakers are exceptional and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.440
 already this job she plays already nothing but level of aesthetics 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.490
 actually we can not miss them in a store or even in a 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.219
 inside to get warmer 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.590
 so these harman kardon speakers his small media ease 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.109
 that can be connected to a PC and a multimedia player 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.879
 mp3 including% and that works independently an amplification 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.109
 to integrate 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.120
 and as we can actually see we can talk about a line for them 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.089
 crystal patients one is on polycarbonate for the price can 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.789
 similar to crystal 799 euros but for 799 euros you read me well 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.789
 of him the permanent indeed 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.779
 when we go into the field I would say the emotional aesthetics 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.689
 the price being in the background 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.169
 the ceo always mane abundant quality podium 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.339
 we actually stay on the acoustic quality level harman kardon 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.670
 so we did not have maximum rendering and steering sound up here we would 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.669
 largely surprised 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.389
 good in the face that to add to all that or so told me if you were not a little 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.729
 more divider since that time my type of design 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.729
 but three of them 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.470
 explore the new trends in high tech design with the horse he is 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.900
 hated the regularities of combined dvd recorder added 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 no 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.839
 the first the jacket 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 bonn 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.569
 the dome 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.569
 55th 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.769
 of rock hours tons this malignant tumor 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.080
 in fact the same 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.430
 I think we are not because we are soft
