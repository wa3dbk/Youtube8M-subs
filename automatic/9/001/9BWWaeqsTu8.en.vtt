00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello uto gifted today wanted 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.670
 show it taste you have a dip in the can 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.980
 vary 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.179
 this is an air attack he took down an opponent 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.619
 that star that is involved here 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:23.220
 golem balls and hounds are still a point of tactics 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:26.119
 that is, look, he releases a golem for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 what but do it at the expense of him 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 kill the Queen to lure your frame 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.430
 also kills and demolishes one Ardov 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 there is he collins not released magicians 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.829
 magic protect buildings to after 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 This hero plows for now 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.930
 in the center of the bombers will be able to wall out 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.469
 honkasta comes out dragons two balls 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.320
 that is, after that the king is overlooked and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.550
 I will now throw the hill in order to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 Knee and King lived a little longer 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.739
 i.e. this hill i sure will be released 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.130
 Archer for stripping deceit 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.390
 that is to kill the dragon as it is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.390
 the main problem here 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.900
 potions are poisonous but here she is not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.850
 especially relevant now a little bit 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 changed the comcast composition of the majority 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.930
 players, that is, before it was magic 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.030
 The main witch is now more 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 fat creatures 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 dragons and hounds golems so they last longer 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.710
 lived and it was impossible to kill them with this potion 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:45.780
 that is, king kills the queen in rashka 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.799
 our queen beats the dragon here on 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 verge that is almost shot and then blows 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.950
 but also the ability 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.050
 they use in time and finishes 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 dragon in the end we get 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.660
 that the king is killed yards torn down and the clan 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.330
 castl cleaned up what we do next then 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.210
 have we release 2 hounds 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.130
 and it starts up wider first. 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.980
 ball and therefore hounds but here since 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.320
 rdv close that is maybe started right away 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 beat well a couple of shots hit ex so 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.490
 that is why the hounds are right 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.660
 because balls and deflation ridge with one 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.130
 the parties, too, itself happens another 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.140
 have all beat hounds shary while they live 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.900
 have 1 h burst minionchik appeared 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.430
 less glasses hit the rest of the buildings and with 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 of this side is the absolute 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.490
 the most why one hounds are on top stove 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 here and 2 hounds bursts again 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.100
 minions which is not bad man base then 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 there is 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.670
 hounds fly on the last third of the rds and 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.670
 go shooting balls 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.040
 all the same when the prince 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:11.880
 on the latest rdf since this is the most 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.650
 the problem is still being killed 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.470
 the hound let up honestly 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.870
 will burst and there will be many minions again what 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.489
 when stripping very very well that is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.500
 when exactly it bursts just not 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 dominion is generally excellent that is 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.850
 it is smartly read that is when not 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.340
 so many minions base pretty 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 returns and the heroes are demolished and still 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.590
 minions balls remain 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.070
 it's all defended already building defense 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.440
 no therefore garbage and beat occurred for 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.440
 in the absence too they beat the king 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.830
 well that's why 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.360
 Cartoons were not bad in that beginning 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:07.270
 there will be 16 that is a bit of an account that 4 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:10.960
 hounds occupy 120 places that is and balls 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.470
 there are 16 to 5 well, everything is like this, we get 3 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.740
 stars 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.450
 This tactic is all I wanted for you. 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.400
 show everyone thanks for watching
