alrighty let's move to the back back has
a<00:02:58.820> camera<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.860> kickstand<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:02.550> here<00:03:02.820> so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
a camera and the kickstand over here so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.600 
a camera and the kickstand over here so
they<00:03:03.360> use<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.470> kickstand<00:03:05.190> position

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
they use to have one kickstand position

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.240 
they use to have one kickstand position
on<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> original<00:03:06.239> surface<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:07.160> extended<00:03:08.160> it

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
on the original surface they extended it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.640 
on the original surface they extended it
to<00:03:08.400> two<00:03:08.640> positions<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.269> surface<00:03:09.750> 3<00:03:10.320> has<00:03:11.510> this

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
to two positions and surface 3 has this

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.830 
to two positions and surface 3 has this
friction<00:03:13.650> kickstand<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:14.880> put<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.300> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
friction kickstand so you can put it to

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
it's going to go into the pairing mode

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
it's going to go into the pairing mode
just<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:59.549> this<00:03:59.880> part<00:04:00.480> over<00:04:00.660> here<00:04:01.049> is

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
just like that so this part over here is

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.370 
just like that so this part over here is
the<00:04:01.709> entropy<00:04:02.070> n<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.880> powered<00:04:03.060> by<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.380> quad

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the entropy n and is powered by the quad

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
the entropy n and is powered by the quad
a<00:04:04.590> battery<00:04:05.160> that's<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.489> tiny<00:04:05.910> little<00:04:06.120> battery

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
a battery that's a tiny little battery

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.300 
a battery that's a tiny little battery
that<00:04:06.690> goes<00:04:06.900> over<00:04:07.230> here<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:08.070> are<00:04:08.130> two

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that goes over here and there are two

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
that goes over here and there are two
buttons<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.450> course<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:09.989> write<00:04:10.230> on

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
buttons and of course you can write on

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.580 
buttons and of course you can write on
it<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:11.790> top<00:04:12.390> part<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.959> button<00:04:13.230> part<00:04:13.470> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
it and this top part the button part is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.720 
it and this top part the button part is
connected<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.190> Bluetooth<00:04:14.400> technology

connected with the Bluetooth technology

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.729 
connected with the Bluetooth technology
so<00:04:15.450> thus<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.700> we're<00:04:17.910> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.169> skip<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
so thus that and we're going to skip the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.310 
so thus that and we're going to skip the
connection<00:04:20.729> points<00:04:22.160> Express<00:04:23.160> settings

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.760 

and<00:04:26.700> type<00:04:27.700> in<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.060> username<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.780> give<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and type in the username and give it a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.000 
and type in the username and give it a
few<00:04:29.950> seconds<00:04:30.490> for<00:04:30.730> it<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.850> set<00:04:31.210> up<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.800> there

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
few seconds for it to set up so there

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.710 
few seconds for it to set up so there
were<00:04:33.100> many<00:04:33.340> concerns<00:04:33.700> about<00:04:33.880> changing<00:04:34.540> from

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
were many concerns about changing from

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.290 
were many concerns about changing from
