isn't that good and today I would like
to<00:00:45.030> speak<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.649> about<00:00:46.850> high<00:00:47.850> speed<00:00:48.149> juicers

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to speak to you about high speed juicers

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010 
to speak to you about high speed juicers
versus<00:00:49.649> slow<00:00:50.250> moving<00:00:50.730> juicers<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
versus slow moving juicers because this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
versus slow moving juicers because this
is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> question<00:00:52.590> I've<00:00:52.739> been<00:00:52.770> asked<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.250> know

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
is a question I've been asked you know

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
is a question I've been asked you know
very<00:00:53.699> often<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.809> best<00:00:55.079> juicers<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
very often what are the best juicers to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.029 
very often what are the best juicers to
buy<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.879> affordable<00:00:57.390> ones<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
buy what are affordable ones and do you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
buy what are affordable ones and do you
really<00:00:59.309> lose<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> quality<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.379> use

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
really lose a lot of quality if you use

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.359 
really lose a lot of quality if you use
a<00:01:01.680> high-speed<00:01:02.329> juicer<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.260> here's<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
a high-speed juicer so here's my take on

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.429 
a high-speed juicer so here's my take on
it

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
it

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
it
just<00:01:07.439> plain<00:01:07.680> science<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.030> research<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
just plain science and just research is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.830 
just plain science and just research is
showing<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.799> slow<00:01:11.610> moving<00:01:12.000> juicers<00:01:12.570> are

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
showing that slow moving juicers are

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620 
showing that slow moving juicers are
better<00:01:13.369> because<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.580> extra<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
better because they extra it's a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
better because they extra it's a
different<00:01:16.020> technique<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.860> slow<00:01:17.159> moving

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
different technique you know slow moving

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.630 
different technique you know slow moving
juicers<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.259> crushing<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.890> plants<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
juicers are crushing the plants and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.840 
juicers are crushing the plants and
extracting<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.810> through<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> know

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
extracting them through you know

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
extracting them through you know
crushing<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.659> pressing<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.860> juice

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
crushing them and and pressing the juice

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
crushing them and and pressing the juice
out<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.759> plant<00:01:27.000> fiber<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
out of the plant fiber so that's a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
out of the plant fiber so that's a
different<00:01:29.189> technique<00:01:29.520> than<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> high-speed

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
different technique than the high-speed

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.870 
different technique than the high-speed
juicers<00:01:30.689> where<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.340> fruits

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
juicers where you just put in the fruits

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
juicers where you just put in the fruits
and<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> veggies<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> they're<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.409> by

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and the veggies and they're you know by

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.179 
and the veggies and they're you know by
node<00:01:35.040> thirty<00:01:35.880> forty<00:01:36.270> thousand<00:01:36.890> spins<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
node thirty forty thousand spins a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
node thirty forty thousand spins a
minute<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.790> far<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.780> they

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
minute as far as I know you know they

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.499 
minute as far as I know you know they
just<00:01:40.350> through<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> through<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> forces<00:01:42.360> out

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
just through the through the forces out

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
just through the through the forces out
of<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.250> know

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
of you just going you you just you know

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940 
of you just going you you just you know
all<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> liquids<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.329> fleeing<00:01:45.710> through<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
all the liquids are fleeing through the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649 
all the liquids are fleeing through the
through<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> net<00:01:47.850> through<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> metal<00:01:48.509> net

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
through the net through the metal net

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
through the net through the metal net
outside<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.220> way<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.460> extract

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
outside and this this way you extract

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
outside and this this way you extract
the<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> juice<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.890> different

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the the juice so it's a different

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
the the juice so it's a different
technique<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.360> explaining

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
technique I think I was not explaining

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620 
technique I think I was not explaining
it<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.409> good<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.180> different

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it very very good but it is a different

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.319 
it very very good but it is a different
technique<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.229> slow<00:01:59.100> juicer<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> high<00:02:00.090> speed

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
technique a slow juicer and a high speed

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.030 
technique a slow juicer and a high speed
juicer<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.200> high<00:02:01.320> speed<00:02:01.560> juicer<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
juicer and the high speed juicer this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030 
juicer and the high speed juicer this
way<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.909> extracted<00:02:03.500> not<00:02:04.500> through

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
way because it's extracted not through

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.789 
way because it's extracted not through
just<00:02:05.670> crushing<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.560> through

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
just crushing it but you know through

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.839 
just crushing it but you know through
this<00:02:07.950> different<00:02:08.340> technique

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
this different technique

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.600 
this different technique
you<00:02:09.270> lose<00:02:09.599> nutrients<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:11.009> that's<00:02:11.310> why<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you lose nutrients so that's why the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.600 
you lose nutrients so that's why the
slow-moving<00:02:12.060> juicers<00:02:12.510> are

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
slow-moving juicers are

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.580 
slow-moving juicers are
it's<00:02:14.000> more<00:02:14.210> natural<00:02:14.360> more<00:02:14.840> gentle<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
it's more natural more gentle and the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's more natural more gentle and the
fast<00:02:15.830> fast<00:02:16.340> moving<00:02:16.820> they<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.930> juice<00:02:18.320> does<00:02:18.700> you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
fast fast moving they the juice does you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.420 
fast fast moving they the juice does you
know<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.360> mixed<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:20.750> oxygen<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.920> right

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
know is it's mixed with oxygen so right

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.760 
know is it's mixed with oxygen so right
there<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.090> lose<00:02:23.390> some<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
there you just lose some of the of the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.220 
there you just lose some of the of the
quality<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.460> juice

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
quality of the juice

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.870 
quality of the juice
that's<00:02:27.230> why<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> actually<00:02:28.250> if<00:02:28.370> you're<00:02:28.550> really

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that's why I actually if you're really

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.300 
that's why I actually if you're really

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
high-speed juicer it's still so much

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.590 
high-speed juicer it's still so much
better<00:02:46.220> than<00:02:46.610> any<00:02:46.850> other<00:02:47.090> liquid<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.570> can

better than any other liquid you can
drink<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.890> because<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.370> not<00:02:49.520> as<00:02:49.700> good

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150

moving juicer juicer does not mean that

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.320 
moving juicer juicer does not mean that
it's<00:02:57.110> still<00:02:57.440> super<00:02:57.950> super<00:02:58.280> healthy<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:59.120> see

where<00:02:59.480> I'm<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.570> with<00:02:59.960> this<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.350> before<00:03:01.070> you

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
where I'm going with this so before you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.860 
where I'm going with this so before you
don't<00:03:01.520> buy<00:03:01.700> any<00:03:01.880> juicer<00:03:02.150> because<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.660> thing

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
don't buy any juicer because the thing

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.500 
don't buy any juicer because the thing
is<00:03:02.900> downside<00:03:03.590> is<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.890> those<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:05.150> know<00:03:05.270> as

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
is downside is that those you know as

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.090 
is downside is that those you know as
slow-moving<00:03:05.900> juicers<00:03:06.350> are<00:03:06.530> more<00:03:06.740> expensive

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
slow-moving juicers are more expensive

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.370 
slow-moving juicers are more expensive
than<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.970> high-speed<00:03:08.300> juicers<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.960> you

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
than the high-speed juicers you know you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.590 
than the high-speed juicers you know you
can<00:03:09.530> get<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.650> high-speed<00:03:10.010> juicer<00:03:10.280> for<00:03:10.430> like<00:03:10.600> $50

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
can get a high-speed juicer for like $50

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.720 
can get a high-speed juicer for like $50
$100<00:03:12.230> something<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.830> between<00:03:12.950> there<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.610> know

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
$100 something in between there you know

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.610 
$100 something in between there you know
and<00:03:14.000> those<00:03:14.450> slow-moving<00:03:14.840> juices<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.500> go

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and those slow-moving juices they can go

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.310 
and those slow-moving juices they can go
up<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.980> $1,000<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:16.940> beyond<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.660> even<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.140> see

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
up to $1,000 so beyond that even you see

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.830 
up to $1,000 so beyond that even you see
so<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.280> why<00:03:19.489> before<00:03:19.820> if<00:03:20.270> money<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.660> an

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
so that's why before if money is an

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.470 
so that's why before if money is an
issue<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.200> still<00:03:21.530> can<00:03:21.800> go<00:03:21.980> with<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.480> high-speed

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
issue you still can go with a high-speed

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.600 
issue you still can go with a high-speed
juicer<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:23.989> maybe<00:03:24.500> even<00:03:24.590> better<00:03:24.980> we've<00:03:25.400> been

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
juicer or maybe even better we've been

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.920 
juicer or maybe even better we've been
doing<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:25.880> for<00:03:25.940> years<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.630> that's<00:03:26.810> really

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
doing this for years so that's really

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.080 
doing this for years so that's really
the<00:03:27.050> best<00:03:27.320> tip<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:27.980> people<00:03:28.370> who<00:03:28.550> really<00:03:28.820> want
