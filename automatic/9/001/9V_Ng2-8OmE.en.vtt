behind me is showing fire within a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.380 
behind me is showing fire within a
diamond<00:01:21.950> which<00:01:22.099> of<00:01:22.250> course<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> great<00:01:22.970> thing

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
diamond which of course is a great thing

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.990 
diamond which of course is a great thing
to<00:01:23.569> have<00:01:23.750> within<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.349> diamond<00:01:24.560> but<00:01:25.429> that<00:01:25.729> is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
to have within the diamond but that is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.800 
to have within the diamond but that is
not<00:01:26.300> diamond<00:01:26.990> color<00:01:27.459> okay<00:01:28.459> fire<00:01:29.330> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
not diamond color okay fire and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.900 
not diamond color okay fire and
dispersion<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.069> observance<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.759> the

see<00:01:34.009> within<00:01:34.250> Diamond<00:01:34.880> has<00:01:35.450> nothing<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.020> do

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
see within Diamond has nothing to do

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.449 
see within Diamond has nothing to do
with<00:01:37.849> its<00:01:38.240> color<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:39.530> has<00:01:39.679> everything<00:01:39.920> to

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
with its color but it has everything to

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.169 
with its color but it has everything to
do<00:01:40.640> with<00:01:40.910> its<00:01:41.390> cut<00:01:41.800> okay<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.340> point<00:01:43.700> number<00:01:43.789> one

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
do with its cut okay so point number one

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.320 
do with its cut okay so point number one
here<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.539> what<00:01:44.720> color<00:01:44.989> isn't<00:01:45.459> color<00:01:46.459> is<00:01:46.880> not

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
here of what color isn't color is not

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.779 
here of what color isn't color is not
fire<00:01:48.250> alright<00:01:49.250> because<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.550> can<00:01:49.670> have

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
fire alright because you can have

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.850 
fire alright because you can have
diamonds<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.390> are<00:01:50.509> great<00:01:50.750> colors<00:01:51.020> with<00:01:51.560> poor

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
diamonds that are great colors with poor

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.669 
diamonds that are great colors with poor
fire<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:53.450> means<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.840> are<00:01:53.959> poor<00:01:54.229> Kyle<00:01:54.470> was

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
fire that means that are poor Kyle was

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.479 
fire that means that are poor Kyle was
with<00:01:55.399> great<00:01:55.640> fire<00:01:55.940> also<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:57.649> any<00:01:57.800> case<00:01:58.069> all

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
with great fire also in any case all

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.889 
with great fire also in any case all
right<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:58.849> that's<00:01:59.000> misconception<00:01:59.840> number<00:02:00.110> one

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
right so that's misconception number one

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.620 
right so that's misconception number one
the<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.830> next<00:02:04.220> this<00:02:04.759> next<00:02:04.819> portion<00:02:05.479> here

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the this next this next portion here

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.479 
the this next this next portion here
that<00:02:05.720> we're<00:02:05.810> going<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:05.989> look<00:02:06.170> at<00:02:06.349> is<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
that we're going to look at is a

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.770 
that we're going to look at is a
comparison<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.330> two<00:02:08.390> diamonds<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.480> light

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
comparison of two diamonds as the light

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.680 
comparison of two diamonds as the light
conditions<00:02:12.770> change<00:02:13.220> from<00:02:13.790> diffuse<00:02:14.360> lighting

yellow cast on to the Sun it could make

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.130 
yellow cast on to the Sun it could make
a<00:03:58.350> colorless<00:03:58.950> diamond<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.550> D<00:03:59.940> color<00:04:00.239> of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140

white<00:04:01.440> diamond<00:04:01.920> look<00:04:02.190> yellowish<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.420> your

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
white diamond look yellowish so your

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.240

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.499 
not a good demonstration of color of
what<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.169> how<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> actually<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.430> color

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
what of how to actually see color

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.700 
what of how to actually see color
another<00:04:43.139> thing<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.710> often<00:04:43.979> mistaken<00:04:44.819> for

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
another thing that is often mistaken for

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.740 
another thing that is often mistaken for
color<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:48.810> poor<00:04:49.650> cut<00:04:49.919> quality<00:04:50.460> all<00:04:51.389> right

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
color is a poor cut quality all right

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.960 
color is a poor cut quality all right
when<00:04:52.020> we<00:04:52.199> take<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.470> diamonds<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.580> we're

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
when we take a diamonds and we're

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.020 
when we take a diamonds and we're
looking<00:04:54.300> at<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.539> in<00:04:54.870> diffused<00:04:55.590> lighting<00:04:56.069> for

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
looking at it in diffused lighting for

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.820 
looking at it in diffused lighting for
the<00:04:57.120> optical<00:04:57.539> characteristic<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.349> brightness

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
the optical characteristic of brightness

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.800 
the optical characteristic of brightness
okay<00:04:59.340> right<00:04:59.580> now<00:04:59.759> you<00:04:59.819> see<00:05:00.180> on<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.509> screen

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
okay right now you see on the screen

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.850 
okay right now you see on the screen
behind<00:05:01.050> me<00:05:01.349> a<00:05:02.340> comparison<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.240> two<00:05:03.300> stones<00:05:03.860> now

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
behind me a comparison of two stones now

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.650 
behind me a comparison of two stones now
the<00:05:05.220> two<00:05:05.400> stones<00:05:05.729> that<00:05:05.910> you're<00:05:06.030> looking<00:05:06.360> at<00:05:06.509> in

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
the two stones that you're looking at in

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.189 
the two stones that you're looking at in
that<00:05:06.780> comparison<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:09.449> one<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.840> them<00:05:09.960> looks

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
that comparison the one of them looks

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.170 
that comparison the one of them looks
more<00:05:10.740> dismal<00:05:11.449> and<00:05:12.449> one<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.810> them<00:05:12.960> looks<00:05:13.169> whiter

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
more dismal and one of them looks whiter

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.439 
more dismal and one of them looks whiter
okay<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:17.130> whiter<00:05:17.490> stone<00:05:18.650> happens<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.889> be

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
okay and the whiter stone happens to be

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.870 
okay and the whiter stone happens to be
technically<00:05:21.449> a<00:05:21.810> three<00:05:22.650> shades<00:05:23.070> lower<00:05:23.550> in

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
technically a three shades lower in

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.710 
technically a three shades lower in
color<00:05:25.039> than<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:26.190> diamond<00:05:26.639> on<00:05:26.849> your<00:05:26.880> left<00:05:27.419> in

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
color than the diamond on your left in

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.550 
color than the diamond on your left in
this<00:05:27.870> video

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
this video

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.400 
this video
okay<00:05:29.099> the<00:05:29.250> diamond<00:05:29.580> on<00:05:29.639> your<00:05:29.669> left<00:05:29.970> is<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.810> is<00:05:31.349> a

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
okay the diamond on your left is a is a

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.610 
okay the diamond on your left is a is a
higher<00:05:31.889> color<00:05:32.430> stone<00:05:32.789> but<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.479> is<00:05:33.659> not<00:05:33.870> cut<00:05:34.349> as

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
higher color stone but it is not cut as

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.990 
higher color stone but it is not cut as
nicely<00:05:35.340> as<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:37.199> stone<00:05:37.470> on<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.800> right<00:05:38.009> all

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
nicely as the stone on the right all

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.969 
nicely as the stone on the right all
right<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:39.810> when<00:05:40.139> you're<00:05:40.229> looking<00:05:40.500> at<00:05:40.620> diamonds

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
right so when you're looking at diamonds

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.370 
right so when you're looking at diamonds
and<00:05:41.250> diffuse<00:05:41.639> light<00:05:41.940> even<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> face<00:05:43.110> up

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
and diffuse light even in the face up

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.550 
and diffuse light even in the face up
position<00:05:44.180> that<00:05:45.180> is<00:05:45.389> not<00:05:45.599> going<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.289> be<00:05:46.409> an

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
position that is not going to be an

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.490 
position that is not going to be an
accurate<00:05:47.030> determination<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.210> color<00:05:49.110> in<00:05:49.409> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
accurate determination of color in a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.149 
accurate determination of color in a
diamond<00:05:50.479> alright<00:05:51.479> so<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.380> main<00:05:52.620> points<00:05:53.009> we

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
diamond alright so the main points we

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.070 
diamond alright so the main points we
just<00:05:53.190> want<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.550> drive<00:05:53.729> home<00:05:53.970> here<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.449> that<00:05:54.900> if

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
just want to drive home here is that if

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.930 
just want to drive home here is that if
you're<00:05:55.229> going<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.590> try<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:55.860> see<00:05:56.130> color<00:05:56.490> in<00:05:56.610> a

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
you're going to try to see color in a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.370 
you're going to try to see color in a
diamond<00:05:57.590> looking<00:05:58.590> at<00:05:58.770> them<00:05:59.009> face<00:05:59.460> up<00:05:59.490> in

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
diamond looking at them face up in

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.689 
diamond looking at them face up in
common<00:06:01.380> viewing<00:06:01.710> environments<00:06:02.310> whether<00:06:02.490> it's

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
common viewing environments whether it's

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.700 
common viewing environments whether it's
spot<00:06:03.060> lighting<00:06:03.570> or<00:06:03.719> even<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.229> diffuse

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
spot lighting or even in diffuse

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.370 
spot lighting or even in diffuse
lighting<00:06:04.979> is<00:06:05.340> really<00:06:05.909> not<00:06:06.479> not<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.990> best<00:06:07.199> way

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
lighting is really not not the best way

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.490 
lighting is really not not the best way
to<00:06:07.409> do<00:06:07.770> it<00:06:07.919> it<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.849> possible<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.539> see<00:06:09.930> color<00:06:10.229> and

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
to do it it is possible to see color and

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.939 
to do it it is possible to see color and
diamond<00:06:13.699> in<00:06:14.699> the<00:06:15.030> face<00:06:15.270> up<00:06:15.539> position<00:06:16.139> but

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
diamond in the face up position but

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.469 
diamond in the face up position but
there<00:06:17.159> are<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.310> lot<00:06:17.370> of<00:06:17.550> different<00:06:17.969> letters<00:06:18.300> on

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
there are a lot of different letters on

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:19.520 
there are a lot of different letters on
the<00:06:18.570> color<00:06:18.780> scale<00:06:19.110> we're<00:06:19.259> going<00:06:19.349> to<00:06:19.409> be

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
the color scale we're going to be

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.499 
the color scale we're going to be
covering<00:06:19.770> exactly<00:06:20.490> all<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.610> definitions<00:06:21.330> and

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
covering exactly all the definitions and

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.020 
covering exactly all the definitions and
how<00:06:21.719> those<00:06:22.050> are<00:06:22.280> properly<00:06:23.280> examined<00:06:23.759> in<00:06:23.849> just

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
how those are properly examined in just

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.029 
how those are properly examined in just
a<00:06:24.150> second<00:06:24.630> but<00:06:25.020> if<00:06:25.229> you're<00:06:25.500> looking<00:06:25.830> in<00:06:25.949> the

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
a second but if you're looking in the

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.219 
a second but if you're looking in the
face<00:06:26.250> up<00:06:26.490> position<00:06:26.940> it's<00:06:27.539> not<00:06:27.870> going<00:06:28.050> to<00:06:28.110> be

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
face up position it's not going to be

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.439 
face up position it's not going to be
accurate<00:06:28.639> but<00:06:29.639> when<00:06:29.789> you<00:06:29.880> once<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.180> start

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
accurate but when you once you start

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.810 
accurate but when you once you start
getting<00:06:30.570> to<00:06:30.900> like<00:06:31.080> 4<00:06:31.710> different<00:06:32.070> color<00:06:32.490> grades

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
getting to like 4 different color grades

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.520 
getting to like 4 different color grades
different<00:06:33.090> 3<00:06:33.479> or<00:06:33.570> 4<00:06:33.750> different<00:06:33.870> color<00:06:34.229> grades

different 3 or 4 different color grades
different<00:06:34.770> if<00:06:35.099> you're<00:06:35.550> really<00:06:35.849> if<00:06:35.969> you<00:06:36.060> got<00:06:36.180> to

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
different if you're really if you got to

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.450 
different if you're really if you got to
call<00:06:36.479> a<00:06:36.509> sensitive<00:06:37.050> eyes<00:06:37.259> then<00:06:37.949> you'll<00:06:38.190> start

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
call a sensitive eyes then you'll start

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.560 
call a sensitive eyes then you'll start
noticing<00:06:38.520> ever<00:06:39.419> so<00:06:39.750> faint<00:06:40.110> tints<00:06:40.620> of<00:06:40.740> color

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
noticing ever so faint tints of color

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.390 
noticing ever so faint tints of color
within<00:06:42.570> the<00:06:42.750> diamonds<00:06:43.320> and<00:06:43.620> we're<00:06:44.219> going<00:06:44.340> to

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
within the diamonds and we're going to

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.830 
within the diamonds and we're going to
look<00:06:44.520> at<00:06:44.639> those<00:06:44.820> critically<00:06:45.389> and<00:06:45.630> we're<00:06:45.719> going

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
look at those critically and we're going

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.570 
look at those critically and we're going
