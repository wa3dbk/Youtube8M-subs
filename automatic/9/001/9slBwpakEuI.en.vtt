00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
short chapters maybe you should just

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.440 
short chapters maybe you should just
make<00:03:21.100> bigger<00:03:21.640> larger<00:03:22.299> ones<00:03:24.030> yeah<00:03:25.030> I'm

laughing<00:03:26.200> now<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.859> best<00:03:27.100> example<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.850> is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
laughing now the best example this is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.060 
laughing now the best example this is
when<00:03:28.209> they<00:03:28.390> magically<00:03:28.959> appear<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.470> Russia<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
when they magically appear in Russia and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.370 
when they magically appear in Russia and
arrive<00:03:30.310> at<00:03:30.489> Anastasius<00:03:31.150> house<00:03:31.420> in<00:03:31.660> Moscow<00:03:32.049> it

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
arrive at Anastasius house in Moscow it

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.680 
arrive at Anastasius house in Moscow it
is<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> little<00:03:33.130> unnecessary<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:34.090> include<00:03:34.450> all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
is a little unnecessary to include all

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.449 
is a little unnecessary to include all
the<00:03:34.750> details<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.620> what<00:03:35.769> happened<00:03:35.950> since<00:03:36.280> they

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
the details of what happened since they

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.240 
the details of what happened since they
arrived<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.959> could<00:03:38.109> skim<00:03:38.440> through<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.160> a

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
arrived you could skim through that in a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.930 
arrived you could skim through that in a
couple<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.579> paragraphs<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:41.489> lastly<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.609> lot<00:03:42.850> of

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
couple of paragraphs and lastly a lot of

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.509 
couple of paragraphs and lastly a lot of
chapters<00:03:43.570> seem<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.019> end<00:03:44.140> with<00:03:44.530> Aubrey<00:03:45.010> falling
