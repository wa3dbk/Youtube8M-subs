00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it's pretty obvious when I don't pay

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.940 
it's pretty obvious when I don't pay
attention<00:00:47.600> these<00:00:48.600> M&amp;Ms<00:00:49.050> taste<00:00:49.379> weird

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
attention these M&amp;Ms taste weird

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
attention these M&amp;Ms taste weird
that<00:00:50.100> wasn't<00:00:50.280> an<00:00:50.460> M&amp;M<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> button<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that wasn't an M&amp;M that was a button and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080 
that wasn't an M&amp;M that was a button and
what<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> love<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.770> how<00:00:52.949> desperate<00:00:53.370> people<00:00:53.969> are

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
what I love is how desperate people are

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
what I love is how desperate people are
to<00:00:54.270> keep<00:00:54.510> reading<00:00:54.899> their<00:00:55.260> texts<00:00:55.710> while

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to keep reading their texts while

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.520 
to keep reading their texts while
pretending<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.059> focus<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.289> think

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pretending to focus on you and I think

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
pretending to focus on you and I think
it's<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:58.920> phones<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.760> large<00:01:00.090> these

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it's because phones are so large these

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's because phones are so large these
days<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.870> mean<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.559> phone<00:01:01.859> rings
