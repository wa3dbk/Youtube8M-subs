 happy afternoon again here another 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.899
 Christmas craftsmanship in everything 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.639
 for everyone today we are going to make another 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.380
 decoration for our tree but in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.750
 this opportunity we are going to make a doll 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.089
 of snow we have already done one in phobias 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.550
 we will also continue using 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.010
 our tongue tongues or paddle sticks 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.930
 as we already did the little tree in a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.960
 previous occasion then let's do 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 this time a snowman with sticks 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.900
 of palette what we need for it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 is 5 tongue depressor or paddle sticks what 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.530
 what we say are these are we going 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.750
 to use a brush and with our brush 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 white and black paint are what we're going 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 to use as we need a strip 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.480
 to make the nose and yellow to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.059
 make a decoration our silicone 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.840
 hot red marker and black pencil 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.830
 scissors a pair of eyes 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.730
 crazy for our snowman and the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.250
 golden thread with which we are going to hang 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.740
 our our snowman and a 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.130
 base on which we are going to stick our 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.240
 sticks that can be a white sheet 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.720
 because you will soon have at hand 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.030
 cardboard what they want to use in one 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 of our sticks we are going to make a 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.619
 small line 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 in the corners as a base to remove 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.469
 this circular part then we're going to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.890
 cut and we will leave flat the 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.890
 corners 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.090
 of our 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.509
 we do this side by side when 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.119
 we have already cut the two corners 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.659
 we are going to paint this stick by side and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.579
 side with its neil auto edges 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.039
 used our brush and our 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.110
 black paint on this stick we are going to 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.110
 paint it completely black 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.690
 what we are going to do with the four low 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.000
 remaining languages ​​is that we are going to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.520
 measure more or less you can calculate the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.760
 need to suddenly look at them with 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.569
 ruler calculate more or less the center of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 the sticks and let's make a line 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.170
 in the 4 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.200
 and we're going to start painting that we're going to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.120
 paint let's paint half of black 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 there is no need for it to be painted 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.510
 both sides only on one side and the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.930
 edges then let's paint the half 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.530
 in black and the other half in white we 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.739
 they will stay 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.319
 in this way then here we have the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.970
 who had told them the stick 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.840
 we know that the one we cut the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.519
 corners and here we have the others like 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.610
 you can only realize for a 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.750
 side 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.300
 half black to my table 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.300
 what we are going to happen now is to appeal 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.090
 and then with our hot silicone 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.030
 let's apply 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.030
 in the whole color union 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.360
 final 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.660
 let's stick our stick leaving it 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.500
 central that we have a little corner 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.500
 to face 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.430
 we will stay this way so that 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.130
 would be in this case the little leaf if we want 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 that we are safer than ours - 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.830
 be stronger what we do is that 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.780
 before sticking this stick that skoda the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.230
 base of the hat cup of our 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 snowman we paste on our 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.540
 white sheet the four sticks 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.909
 the hits on the other 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.620
 It can already be with hot silicone or with 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.870
 white glue with what you are 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.590
 say you can paste 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.709
 and we just cut around the edge 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.079
 then when it is already entourage then it is going to 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.130
 remain adhered to our 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.680
 tongue blade the white leaf cut 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.350
 our indicates 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.479
 with which we are going to hang it then 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.620
 like this is our hat we are going to 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.620
 stick on the back 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.980
 a little bit of silicone and we're going to paste 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.840
 our tape 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.840
 which is the one we 're going to hang with 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.970
 there we have it for a moment 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.870
 and we have left 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.500
 we happened to stick our eyes 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.210
 of our doll 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.650
 so 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.650
 we indicate in this way 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.290
 remember that you can use 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.290
 many more things 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.350
 we are staying in this way 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.520
 let's do it 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.520
 two circles 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.790
 what are they going to do as their 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.790
 cheeks 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.200
 and we get this way we're going to 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.200
 trace his mouth 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.870
 and this way 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.270
 what are we going to do with the background and we're going to 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.760
 mark in the yellow the decoration that 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.000
 you wish for the hat in this 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.540
 case I made a star and with the 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.600
 orange let's mark the nose 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.870
 and we will stay this way 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.650
 I have already worked on this in this case 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.390
 place the paper in the back 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.340
 as I told them if they suddenly want it or 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.320
 if they want to leave it only with 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.480
 sticks and paint them complete with 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.580
 you wish but this is another way 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.850
 so what I did was paste them and 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.169
 just cut by its edge the 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.409
 little leaf 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:39.189
 and we are left this way I did the nose 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:41.400
 in orange and a star in color 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.719
 yellow for hat decoration 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.759
 so in this way we can stay 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.499
 something very simple something that children 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.469
 you can do at home you can 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:52.419
 You can put them to help them 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.069
 paint the tongue tongues of the 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.189
 palette sticks like in this case that 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:07:01.120
 my nephew helped me then it's something very 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:03.370
 cool and so very helpful for 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.529
 the decoration of our home so 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.629
 that's one more note I hope you can 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.349
 apply I hope you like acquire 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:10.349
 everything back
