00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 for llamas 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 Amen 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 what's up bars in general I'm in 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.559
 the episode number 7 of the guide 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.330
 call of duty curry plans 2 for the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.130
 zombies mode and in this episode you can 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.010
 teach how to get it the state already 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 that is a little hidden in the wall and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.860
 I'll also show you a shortcut 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 very useful for 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.300
 to get to the mansion of the witches 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 without using the giant anymore 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.040
 you know that to vary the mansion 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 we need to break some debris that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 now I will explain it in the video and we will 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 get to do them without breaking them 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.010
 then to get it sat 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.200
 we have to get out of here and nothing else 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 start and we have to accumulate 2000 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.260
 points once we accumulate 2000 points 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 we have to come to these races 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.580
 jump with double jump jump to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 hold on fast buy the table and the 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.440
 soil is broken because you have to be very very 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.150
 very fast you have to be super rabid if 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.520
 you want this weapon is the only way to 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.420
 have this soul on this map so 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.190
 you see is a good weapon with 100 of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.880
 Charger redemption and 400 gift 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.680
 thing that is very very well I say the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.650
 only way to get it would be that in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.140
 round 1 is nothing else to start you have 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.030
 that will jump and remember that it only falls or 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.490
 is that you have to do it super fast in 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.070
 continue to buy the nothing will go up 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.560
 because only this soul falls also the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.200
 We can keep in the fridge or whether 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.500
 I have kept the fridge 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.350
 I did this and now you will see here in third 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.329
 person I did this to buy from the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.640
 I kept 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.110
 look well at the coal you see is that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.729
 the mind is not very visible to the people 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.439
 tends to pull the double army 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.479
 jump is immediately purchased and the floor is 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.100
 it falls into view not then what 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.189
 save in the fridge and in the game 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.110
 Next it goes to other 2000 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.409
 to buy the you can have in the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.170
 fridge 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.149
 and now we go with the shortcut the shortcut you see 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 where is the mansion of the witches 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.899
 make sure you have some debris to 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.789
 happen that can only be broken 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.590
 thanks to the giant where the alcohol that 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.360
 it is mosquea and it breaks it but if we come 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.519
 here we stick to this column and 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.310
 we jump to the left we 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.450
 we will get a step 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.920
 transparent that what it allows is that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.170
 we can sneak in here without 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.049
 need to use giant and break nothing 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 and then we will be in the mansion 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.099
 you just have to pay for the door 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 is we save ourselves from breaking the rubble 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.910
 so nothing produse I've been this 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.129
