I<00:00:38.610> did<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.720> were<00:00:39.780> back<00:00:40.019> row

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:58.439 
a really pretty dog and I really love

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.710 
a really pretty dog and I really love
the<00:00:58.559> outfit<00:00:58.949> that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.650 

very<00:01:02.380> sparkly<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.460> feels<00:01:03.760> really<00:01:04.090> soft<00:01:04.360> as

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
very sparkly and it feels really soft as

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.600 
very sparkly and it feels really soft as
well<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.680> they've<00:01:05.890> got<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.190> more<00:01:06.370> or<00:01:06.460> less

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
well and they've got it more or less

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.870 
well and they've got it more or less
spot-on<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:08.500> similar<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.580> outfit

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
spot-on I think similar to the outfit

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.050 
spot-on I think similar to the outfit
actually<00:01:10.000> better<00:01:10.420> than<00:01:10.540> metal<00:01:10.840> dead<00:01:12.060> apart

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
actually better than metal dead apart

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually better than metal dead apart
from<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.870> boots<00:01:14.080> which<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.650> don't<00:01:14.800> understand

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
from the boots which I don't understand

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.270 
from the boots which I don't understand
because<00:01:15.520> they<00:01:16.180> recycled<00:01:16.780> believe<00:01:17.320> experts<00:01:17.650> to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
because they recycled believe experts to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.520 
because they recycled believe experts to
do<00:01:18.430> all<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.940> charmix<00:01:19.420> dolls<00:01:19.690> but<00:01:20.260> for<00:01:20.410> some

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
do all the charmix dolls but for some

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.310 
do all the charmix dolls but for some
reason<00:01:20.950> they<00:01:21.190> used<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.790> same<00:01:21.970> ones<00:01:22.300> on<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:23.110> of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
reason they used the same ones on all of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.720 
reason they used the same ones on all of
them<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.850> mean<00:01:24.850> if<00:01:25.030> they<00:01:25.090> used<00:01:25.570> say<00:01:25.990> blooms

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
them I mean if they used say blooms

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.600 
them I mean if they used say blooms
lyrics<00:01:27.730> boots<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.800> recycle<00:01:29.800> them<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.310> turn

them<00:01:30.640> orange<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.530> would<00:01:32.620> have<00:01:32.710> been<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.830> perfect

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
them orange it would have been a perfect

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.270 
them orange it would have been a perfect
for<00:01:33.550> stava<00:01:33.729> because<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.390> goes<00:01:34.570> quite<00:01:34.960> higher

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
for stava because it goes quite higher

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030 
for stava because it goes quite higher
or<00:01:36.280> for<00:01:36.640> us<00:01:36.880> or<00:01:37.330> anyone<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.770> would<00:01:38.920> have<00:01:39.010> been

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
or for us or anyone it would have been

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.280 
or for us or anyone it would have been
much<00:01:39.190> better<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:39.700> no<00:01:40.330> they<00:01:40.660> decided<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.140> get

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
much better but no they decided to get

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
much better but no they decided to get

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and that and also it's a wire so this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
and that and also it's a wire so this
wire<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.620> actually<00:02:08.070> much<00:02:08.160> better<00:02:08.340> than<00:02:08.550> Matins

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
wire is actually much better than Matins

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.440 
wire is actually much better than Matins
wine<00:02:09.180> but<00:02:10.110> yeah<00:02:10.760> metals<00:02:11.760> dolls<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.180> actually

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
wine but yeah metals dolls are actually

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.470 
wine but yeah metals dolls are actually
older<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.530> guess<00:02:13.740> why<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
older so you can guess why and the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.900 
older so you can guess why and the
winners<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.710> Velcro<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.820> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
winners go on with a Velcro but if you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.420 
winners go on with a Velcro but if you
just<00:02:18.180> stick<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.750> Velcro<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.190> did

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just stick in one with Velcro like I did

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.170 
just stick in one with Velcro like I did
they<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.210> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
they kind of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.530 
they kind of
for<00:02:22.900> off<00:02:23.200> quite<00:02:23.739> easily<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.760> added<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.390> bit<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
for off quite easily so I added a bit of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.610 
for off quite easily so I added a bit of
blue<00:02:25.780> tights<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.260> top<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.799> keep<00:02:26.829> it<00:02:27.219> steady

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.890 

face<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.459> actually<00:02:31.610> nice<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:31.940> detailed<00:02:32.569> I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
face is actually nice and detailed I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.809 
face is actually nice and detailed I
don't<00:02:33.709> really<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.250> amount<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.610> makeup

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
don't really like the amount of makeup

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.600 
don't really like the amount of makeup

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
happy Jax doesn't actually put that much

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.110 
happy Jax doesn't actually put that much
makeup<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.769> I've<00:02:40.250> heard<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.519> lot<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.730> people<00:02:41.000> can

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
makeup on I've heard a lot of people can

makeup on I've heard a lot of people can
play<00:02:41.269> no<00:02:42.069> makeup<00:02:43.069> isn't<00:02:43.220> good<00:02:43.519> enough<00:02:43.549> from

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
play no makeup isn't good enough from

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.220 
play no makeup isn't good enough from
the<00:02:43.940> jacks<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.540> stuff<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.019> actually

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the jacks and stuff but I actually

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.640 
the jacks and stuff but I actually
really<00:02:45.680> prefer<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.280> way<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:47.060> clean<00:02:47.329> face

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
really prefer it that way the clean face

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.020 
really prefer it that way the clean face
because<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.069> look<00:02:49.190> at<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> actual<00:02:49.760> weeks

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
because if I look at the actual weeks

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.699 
because if I look at the actual weeks
though<00:02:50.329> they<00:02:50.540> haven't<00:02:50.720> actually<00:02:51.049> got<00:02:51.530> that

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
though they haven't actually got that

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.730 
though they haven't actually got that
much<00:02:51.860> makeup<00:02:52.069> on<00:02:52.340> ever

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
much makeup on ever

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.500

yeah<00:02:59.690> that's<00:03:00.690> things<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.200> don't<00:03:01.410> really

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
yeah that's things that I don't really

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080 
yeah that's things that I don't really
like<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.040> articulation<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> legs

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
like the articulation of the legs

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.000 
like the articulation of the legs
because<00:03:03.690> they<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.290> wire<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.860> they're

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
because they kind of a wire but they're

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.090 
because they kind of a wire but they're
like<00:03:05.130> click<00:03:05.670> quiet<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.319> would<00:03:07.590> prefer<00:03:07.770> if

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
like click quiet so I would prefer if

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.309 
like click quiet so I would prefer if
they<00:03:08.220> did<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.640> why<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> lights<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.290> well

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
they did this why in the lights as well

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.690 
they did this why in the lights as well
we<00:03:11.280> could<00:03:11.959> move<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.170> better<00:03:13.380> because<00:03:14.340> these

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
we could move it better because these

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.880 
we could move it better because these
legs<00:03:15.090> break<00:03:15.480> easily

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
legs break easily

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.610
