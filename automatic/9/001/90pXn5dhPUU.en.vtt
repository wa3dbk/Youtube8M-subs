00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 send in the feeling that 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.660
 somehow nobody noticed that regime 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460

 and you will be linked at the beginning 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.989
 not at the beginning at the beginning because the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.270
 Attention is greater at the beginning 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.890
 video you can subscribe or more

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.720
 so say the clips are synonymous with it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 a little something to do here and there 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.320

 short pants and everything you can 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.899
 briefly mentioned 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.280
 and have fun with the tutorial jojo 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.840
 People use the room again 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 backed out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.460
 it should be really difficult I knew 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.719
 to call the trick 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 I know it easy but I know 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.159
 just have his name 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.560
 called backwards because you have the choice after 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.329
 pulls back and up 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.069
 and as always has more details 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:41.640
 and yes that was ever pure you see 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:43.950
 her the movement in the background like this 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.509
 with low zoomed and majestic 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.859
 so again this movement of names 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.569
 you have to time the industry still behind only 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.939
 pull up it's that easy 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.140
 trick is still in the level 1 area and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.119
 on the badges in several steps 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.039
 as always the old lyre 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.719
 zoomed in here and we come here 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.610
 now to the royal requirements 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.289
 and yes you do not already have it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 this is the fund should be without 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.709
 he does not need that trick 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.129
 to look at everything here because you have to 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.129
 can 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.739
 now comes to the first step and indeed 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.989
 that it will take the ball in the foot 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.250
 You have to have the ball in the field as 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.019
 First next to the back 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.389
 perform and here at exercises forward 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.330
 Back around the world safely in there 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.100
 to have and you have to 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.950
 thus the second step and that 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.890
 The main time is to pull back 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 movement and yes here we see it now 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.490
 normal time around again to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.860
 clarify according to normal backwards 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.470
 and again purely in the slow motion 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.420
 but now it starts pulling me soon 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 rearwardly and then upwardly 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.890
 everything is turned putzig there already 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.540
 my start and take the ball again 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.430
 so that's it now quickly back to normal 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.580
 back now you're pulling back soon 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.040
 up 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.040
 Turn 90 degrees and accept that's it 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 yes that the best exercise will be safe soon 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.720
 to have a foot and a gentleman 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 dodging rolling ball then works out 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.640
 This trick is also very good after these 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.640
 dangerous can bolt on without his 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.620
 we come to the conclusion and yes my field to 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.160
 trick is that you are just the tip of the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.980
 day 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.480
 must keep in mind the tip 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.459
 of the day or that you will be sure soon 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.170
 in the plaster keeps every situation 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.190
 also in cannon shots on us and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.680
 Just keep that in mind as we can 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.209
 Carry out your trick and do it today 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.739
 until next time send me clips 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.200
 As always, you are nothing 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.180
 more goes with it and until the next one 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.190
