this<00:06:42.080> weekend<00:06:42.440> definitely<00:06:43.130> seeing<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.240> track

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
this weekend definitely seeing the track

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:45.550 
this weekend definitely seeing the track
this<00:06:44.570> weekend<00:06:44.930> i<00:06:44.990> can<00:06:45.139> see<00:06:45.259> that<00:06:45.290> they've<00:06:45.530> made

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
this weekend i can see that they've made

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.560 
this weekend i can see that they've made
some<00:06:45.710> some<00:06:46.190> changes<00:06:46.550> to<00:06:46.580> it<00:06:46.850> down<00:06:47.360> at<00:06:47.479> the

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
some some changes to it down at the

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.640 
some some changes to it down at the
bottom<00:06:47.720> of<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:47.960> hill<00:06:48.050> i<00:06:48.110> got<00:06:48.320> a<00:06:48.350> little<00:06:48.470> bit

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
bottom of the hill i got a little bit

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.580 
bottom of the hill i got a little bit
more<00:06:48.770> s<00:06:48.949> corners<00:06:49.370> instead<00:06:49.639> of<00:06:49.729> so<00:06:50.180> fast<00:06:50.590> sweepy

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
more s corners instead of so fast sweepy

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.740 
more s corners instead of so fast sweepy
stuff<00:06:51.860> but<00:06:52.100> i<00:06:52.550> think<00:06:53.120> it'll<00:06:53.240> be<00:06:53.300> good<00:06:53.509> that

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
stuff but i think it'll be good that

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.120 
stuff but i think it'll be good that
definitely<00:06:54.229> slowed<00:06:54.500> the<00:06:54.650> speeds<00:06:54.919> down<00:06:55.070> a

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
definitely slowed the speeds down a

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.350 
definitely slowed the speeds down a
little<00:06:55.310> bit<00:06:55.490> maybe<00:06:55.669> be<00:06:55.880> a<00:06:55.910> little<00:06:55.970> bit<00:06:56.270> more

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
little bit maybe be a little bit more

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.490 
little bit maybe be a little bit more
technical<00:06:56.630> because<00:06:56.990> i<00:06:57.080> think<00:06:57.139> we're<00:06:57.320> going<00:06:57.410> to

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
technical because i think we're going to

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.840 
technical because i think we're going to
see<00:06:57.560> a<00:06:57.680> lot<00:06:57.740> of<00:06:57.889> deep<00:06:58.070> ruts<00:06:58.340> in<00:06:58.460> these<00:06:58.580> tighter

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
see a lot of deep ruts in these tighter

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.600 
see a lot of deep ruts in these tighter
corners<00:06:59.169> as<00:07:00.169> well<00:07:00.410> as<00:07:00.560> i<00:07:00.590> think<00:07:00.949> we<00:07:01.039> got<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.160> 180

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
corners as well as i think we got a 180

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.890 
corners as well as i think we got a 180
down<00:07:01.789> here<00:07:01.940> before<00:07:02.090> the<00:07:02.330> rock<00:07:02.539> was<00:07:02.690> leaked

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
down here before the rock was leaked

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.570 
down here before the rock was leaked
which<00:07:03.050> is<00:07:03.199> a<00:07:03.229> bit<00:07:03.410> different<00:07:03.590> but<00:07:03.919> that<00:07:04.310> part

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
which is a bit different but that part

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.129 
which is a bit different but that part
used<00:07:05.060> to<00:07:05.180> be<00:07:05.300> in<00:07:05.419> the<00:07:05.509> track<00:07:05.750> and<00:07:05.930> it<00:07:05.990> was

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
used to be in the track and it was

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.830 
used to be in the track and it was
really<00:07:06.350> sandy<00:07:06.740> so<00:07:07.039> I<00:07:07.280> think<00:07:07.639> that<00:07:08.270> will<00:07:08.630> add<00:07:08.810> to

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
really sandy so I think that will add to

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.510 
really sandy so I think that will add to
maybe<00:07:09.380> a<00:07:09.440> little<00:07:09.590> bit<00:07:09.740> of<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:09.919> roughness<00:07:10.310> and

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
maybe a little bit of the roughness and

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.580 
maybe a little bit of the roughness and
a<00:07:10.610> little<00:07:11.150> bit<00:07:11.240> less<00:07:11.479> flow<00:07:11.810> so<00:07:12.020> it<00:07:12.110> should<00:07:12.260> be<00:07:12.289> a

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
a little bit less flow so it should be a

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.260 
a little bit less flow so it should be a
little<00:07:13.010> bit<00:07:13.160> more<00:07:13.280> physically<00:07:13.669> demanding<00:07:13.699> if

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
little bit more physically demanding if

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.480 
little bit more physically demanding if
possible<00:07:14.750> that<00:07:15.289> then<00:07:15.500> it<00:07:15.620> used<00:07:15.800> to<00:07:15.919> be<00:07:16.010> so<00:07:16.250> I

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
possible that then it used to be so I

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.490 
possible that then it used to be so I
look<00:07:17.150> forward<00:07:17.180> to<00:07:17.570> it<00:07:17.690> because<00:07:17.720> I<00:07:17.870> feel<00:07:18.470> like

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
look forward to it because I feel like

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:27.500 
look forward to it because I feel like
I'm<00:07:18.710> ready<00:07:18.740> to<00:07:18.949> go<00:07:19.070> here<00:07:19.220> this<00:07:19.310> weekend

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.570 

you
