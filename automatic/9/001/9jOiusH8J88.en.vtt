00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 for the team to listen to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.060
 statements of July César Uribe 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.589
 when I finish this game for me it is 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.519
 the most orderly team what I can 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:19.140
 deny that you have to have this every time 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:23.100
 improving I know him very well still 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.369
 being strong draw points out and going to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.369
 arrive 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.960
 this move 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.760
 the other is not to say and there is not a push 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.230
 they are feeling the contact they stretch 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.670
 the trickle message I think they have 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.950
 injured 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.939
 about what my dad said he told me when 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.350
 I feel a contact 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.189
 54 penalties per date 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.630
 the opposite bernardo criminal or failure to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.640
 apply was not quite late and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 after the rematch to mediate a 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 play that was evidently the great 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 option must arrive and you can only have one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.539
 center and appears June from the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.890
 experience in cheeks not because he knows 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.340
 perfectly that the neutrals are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340
 unemployed 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.119
 I think that your domain from 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.470
 win the sides because it has the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.580
 take care not the riva and always ends 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 Deriving the sides week 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.640
 but it is not reflected in the rostrum 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.640
 he spoke hurt 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.289
 Cordoba fully consecrated and much 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.289
 best 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.400
 because now yes no 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:22.140
 the criminal transformed by an instructive 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.380
 and the limit with chub by auto order of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.240
 10 a martín 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.340
 now they are king they are as best of 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.740
 back in the middle and does not have the ball 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.220
 it's like an incomplete 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.680
 maribel montaño where they hang a lot but 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.440
 it does not have san martín perea had to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.060
 go back to find specials to martín and go 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.100
 and is going to get the melgar ball that was going 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.430
 to have san martín oeste this is a 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.550
 party I think false has always 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.630
 cost to martín guirado team no 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.490
 let's analyze the san martín for this 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.780
 match 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.420
 because it was coming from the most teams 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.030
 regular tournament what to fight 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.470
 you get one and very difficult to enter but 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.640
 perea had two very clear situations 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.160
 how are you that we see that they did not arrive 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.160
 when the match is 2-0 with 2-0 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.019
 and no one has passed us up 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.760
 even more and today eleven against eleven of 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.760
 local 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 today 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.120
 can you argue 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.120
 because I have to give the answers 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.109
 no sport is promoted
