00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 your mind software programs your body 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.110
 it's a cascade change it death is a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.849
 urola disease the extinction is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.849
 approach combat what 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.820
 Hello and welcome again to another new 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.240
 a2 time edition today we are going to 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.380
 treat eclipses face eclipses face is a 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.200
 role play set in an era 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.510
 future in which humanity has been 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.040
 practically devastated by some 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.920
 artificial intelligences called 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.770
 They cite that they have destroyed the earth 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.480
 few survivors who have stayed 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.480
 have broken up throughout the solar system 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.170
 resorting to all kinds of technologies 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 that will allow them to live in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.659
 environment is complete and complete and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.269
 absolutely useful is one of the themes 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.860
 that has six that makes it different from 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.920
 other futuristic games 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.330
 and that encompass enough of everything 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.070
 that would be the faithful subject I check a 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.260
 little beyond is the subject of 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.750
 transhumanism the theme of 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.370
 transhumanism is that taking into account 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.100
 that humanity is practically 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.460
 destroyed humans are being 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.460
 starting to transform into something more in 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.050
 what what would be one was almost post 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.590
 human 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.850
 in the dif is one of the things that has 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 is that both your mind and your body are 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.560
 modifiable due to the technology that 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.320
 you have already developed you are able to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 copy your own consciousness and put it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 in other bodies that can be both 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.350
 biological and artificial yet 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.140
 type of combinations that those can 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.170
 happen in addition to it you are capable 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.330
 also because you have converted your 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.420
 mind in something resembling a kind of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.550
 software that is transferable is also 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.620
 for example copiable is also editable 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.750
 you can have several copies of yourself 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.960
 hanging around you can have you can modify 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 you yourself in a way is pretty 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.870
 pretty incredible besides all that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.600
 one of the things that x face offers 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.830
 they separate it from the rest of the games 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:26.080
 is the amount of economic philosophies 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.400
 policies practically like the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.319
 humanity is broken up by all the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.490
 solar system and there is a quantity of 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.980
 space between colÃ³n and incredible colony 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.080
 that allows the various human groups 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.180
 develop your society as you want with 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.100
 which in this book for example os 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.340
 you can find things of the most 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.290
 colorful not only treats of beings 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.660
 human beings but there is also another kind of 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 non-human characters as much as 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.480
 human characters are like for example 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.120
 elevated animals roll or the planet of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.660
 the apes 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.570
 or of ends between people for example 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.130
 and all kinds of other creatures that 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.320
 by genetic engineering they have been 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.000
 endowed with consciousness you can carry 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.760
 also a guide you can take a 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.580
 person who has escaped from the earth 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.650
 but that has not had the luck to be able 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.390
 having a body with which you enter 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.730
 debt with corporations with 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.250
 organizations which are the ones 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.000
 They have paid your body and you need to be 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.620
 a whole series a whole series of time 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.660
 practically being slaves of it from 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.570
 them by contract issues and such 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.980
 this game contains a cornucopia of 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.700
 knowledge more than anything because in addition 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.120
 of evidently having many civil and 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.400
 Implants treats a lot of issues though 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.900
 one of the subjects that maybe major 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.819
 of the game is in addition to science topics 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.749
 very hard fiction 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:58.020
 this game all the issues that it deals with 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:04:01.080
 they are space opera precisely though 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.630
 I have made some concession and admitted 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.900
 some little thing that is not all hard 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.340
 as an example for version and things like that 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 but good is something quite minimal to 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.270
 level of background that does not affect 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.790
 besides all this 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.709
 there is a theme that is terror because 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.220
 the titans and the intelligences 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.040
 artificial that destroyed the earth 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.110
 besides having immense power 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.710
 they disappeared suddenly but they left 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.180
 several things behind many of them 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.190
 quite a lot of them quite 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.410
 lethal the earth is for example a 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.870
 wasteland in which it is almost impossible to go down 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.020
 because you can find out what there is 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.730
 a nano plague that you give yourself that you 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 shred your muscles and start them 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.200
 of the bones or war machines that 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.380
 they make the terminator look like 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.290
 toys 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.680
 and not only that but also one of the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.370
 issues of crisis page is the theme of the 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 mutation the subject of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:08.100
 not not realize that really something 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:12.040
 has changed and there really is something that 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:16.060
 is underlying and that something is rotten 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.220
 inside this is a game in part 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.290
 besides conspiracies because there are 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.630
 secret organizations of all kinds is 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.400
 a game also of terror more than anything 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.900
 because there are many of those horrors of 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.380
 that we have are similar to those 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.790
 horrors your videos is something I can not 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.610
 do too spoiler because this 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.030
 game will be much that you do big 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.760
 spoilers 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.870
 but well I have already passed the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.190
 setting already happening of the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.750
 environment that food is 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.630
 fabulous and scarce the best of the game of 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.320
 system the percentage system 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.820
 Virtually no it complicated much 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.490
 life although the truth is that everything 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.160
 you read it is quite logical the day it is a 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.150
 housing system is a percentage 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.280
 adapted 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.400
 has some modern things like 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.860
 example 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:06.350
 to features such as actions in the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.289
 combat system and the truth is that it is 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.039
 quite pretty flexible enough or 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.380
 be I mainly recommend you if 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.000
 that 's efficiency and direction have it in 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.950
 the only disadvantage is that only 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.800
 is in English 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.140
 there is virtually no company that 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.480
 I know that he has been encouraged to publish 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.970
 one does not flash and it's an authentic 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.370
 pity because the inside of this book 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.060
 it's wonderful it's been sounded from my 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.260
 my favorite RPGs from my collection 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.450
 since I have it there are practically 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.130
 some there are more supplements almost all 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.280
 they cover almost the entire solar system and 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.060
 some and some of them extra there 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.890
 extra solar organization pri through 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.580
 a kind of doors similar to the 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.800
 of stargate but that's one more topic 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.140
 Pretty friend this super supplement 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.580
 anyway one of my games x6 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.550
 I recommend you favorites 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.200
 If you are looking for a game of 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.280
 movie role but if you want to 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.280
 follow me and see you next time
