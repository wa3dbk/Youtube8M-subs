00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so and now we have two possible

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.550 
so and now we have two possible
orientations<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.600> put<00:02:24.780> our<00:02:24.900> hi<00:02:25.020> pad<00:02:25.290> mini

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
first orientation is going to be for

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
first orientation is going to be for
viewing<00:02:28.650> movies<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.790> flip<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.240> stand

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
viewing movies we can flip the stand

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
around then we can see here that this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.340 
around then we can see here that this
orientation<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.630> be<00:02:33.810> perfect<00:02:34.290> for

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
orientation is going to be perfect for

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.430 
orientation is going to be perfect for
typing<00:02:35.300> taking<00:02:36.300> notes<00:02:36.570> if<00:02:36.810> you're<00:02:36.990> possibly
