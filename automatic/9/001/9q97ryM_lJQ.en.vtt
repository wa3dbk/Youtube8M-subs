00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello my name is call me an artist 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.160
 plastic decorator from today I'm going 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 present the blood of the talking about 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 some of my handicraft techniques 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.370
 I work here on my team. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.599
 to start I choose without doubt and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.430
 collective 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.029
 I'm going to teach a patna recipe. 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.369
 province where the head of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.390
 material and then we already start 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 couple is buried 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.340
 the police, so here I am going to use a 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.630
 mps wooden plaque 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.730
 but in the case of eggs the piece I advise 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:01:45.619
 Whenever it passes shows before you start 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:50.690
 work now and goes two hands away 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:54.069
 and 200 and the higher the number of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.069
 finest list 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.230
 because it is nearby and this helps in 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.989
 time to escape 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:50.910
 in the case of this page there are other 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:53.390
 ways to do it today is the page to 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390
 page 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:08.430
 now Pat did not come here some 30 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:13.620
 for you to see the size is for 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.810
 inch per inch and 6 3 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.150
 an idea exist larger and smaller 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.720
 thinner chances 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.829
 You see here when asking is more 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.780
 full of feathers 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:37.650
 I like this one because the most 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.730
 beautiful and best regular here for you 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.519
 see 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.880
 I'll take the hydrometer, no one can be 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.609
 bitumen also points out that the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.680
 bitumen it tar pit so it is 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.030
 super strong even without the water-based 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.489
 it is flammable 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.549
 the smell is strong so never indoors 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.130
 from home in a closed place always places 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.630
 airy and can not put it on 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.970
 because he's going to 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.540
 cat will make a hole will get very 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.769
 Good, then, pick up your board. 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.900
 Hydrometer gives me a little time in high 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.000
 catching just a little bit here 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.250
 I'm not going there straight in the ink, only 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.320
 they are getting dirty because they are part of the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.820
 dry 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 Why are you going to clean the stain? 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.580
 then I'll make the first test 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.760
 control in the hand I do it for me is 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:41.150
 lighter than the move painted in white and 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.460
 worn so that's why he is 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.970
 appearing that brown part that would be the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.880
 right way 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.470
 it is always this effect is to seem that 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.540
 the wood is weather-worn 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.140
 like a man below 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:04.610
 the painting is going out we make the 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:08.000
 new and old painting so it's super easy 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.900
 of course it is much simpler than 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.210
 Do you want to work on the mobile doing 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.320
 some tests before for sure you 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.740
 will achieve 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.740
 fine 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:44.160
 Good people, that's it, I hope you 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.520
 You took the technique and you can stay. 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.980
 said wood plastic iron video only 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.400
 need of a preparation before staying 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:58.410
 plus the flag that I have spoken and reform 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.090
 furniture and objects if you have 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.240
 dropped in your house 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.150
 okay all any recent writes 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:10.200
 below the song who com.br 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:13.340
 but I'm going to leave you, it's okay to 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.340
 next champions
