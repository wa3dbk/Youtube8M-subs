I'm<00:00:01.920> only<00:00:02.220> looking<00:00:02.340> for<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.730> story<00:00:03.030> behind

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
I'm only looking for the story behind

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.470 
I'm only looking for the story behind
the<00:00:03.510> issue

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.850 

and<00:00:07.480> they're<00:00:07.660> not<00:00:07.690> things<00:00:08.020> that<00:00:08.110> i<00:00:08.320> can<00:00:08.530> assume

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
and they're not things that i can assume

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.560 
and they're not things that i can assume
just<00:00:09.400> by<00:00:09.550> looking<00:00:09.850> at<00:00:09.910> somebody<00:00:10.240> there<00:00:10.389> things

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
just by looking at somebody there things

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.840 
just by looking at somebody there things
i<00:00:10.720> need<00:00:10.900> to<00:00:10.930> discover<00:00:11.440> by<00:00:11.830> getting<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:12.820> know

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
i need to discover by getting to know

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.690 
i need to discover by getting to know
them<00:00:16.260> respect<00:00:17.260> is<00:00:17.470> critical<00:00:18.100> because<00:00:18.220> i<00:00:18.490> think

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
them respect is critical because i think

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.120 
them respect is critical because i think
that's<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.119> foundation<00:00:19.360> of<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:20.380> therapeutic

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
that's the foundation of a therapeutic

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.280 
that's the foundation of a therapeutic
relationship<00:00:21.279> I<00:00:21.880> need<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.720> make<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:22.990> really

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
relationship I need to make it really

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.350 
relationship I need to make it really
clear<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:23.860> respect<00:00:24.759> where<00:00:25.000> people<00:00:25.270> are

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
clear that I respect where people are

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.729 
clear that I respect where people are
coming<00:00:25.390> from<00:00:25.689> even<00:00:26.230> if<00:00:26.320> they<00:00:26.410> have<00:00:26.500> very

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
coming from even if they have very

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.010 
coming from even if they have very
different<00:00:27.220> ideas<00:00:27.400> or<00:00:28.090> values<00:00:28.119> in<00:00:28.570> what<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:28.750> have

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
different ideas or values in what I have

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.749 
different ideas or values in what I have
and<00:00:29.259> that's<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.009> basis<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.460> our<00:00:30.579> work

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
and that's the basis of our work

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
and that's the basis of our work
together

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.349 

the<00:00:35.320> importance<00:00:35.949> of<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.399> doctor-patient

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
the importance of the doctor-patient

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.049 
the importance of the doctor-patient
communication<00:00:37.510> is<00:00:38.260> really<00:00:38.800> about<00:00:39.129> creating<00:00:39.910> a

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
communication is really about creating a

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.479 
communication is really about creating a
treatment<00:00:40.570> alliance<00:00:41.199> and<00:00:41.410> creating<00:00:42.159> a<00:00:42.219> plan

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
treatment alliance and creating a plan

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.009 
treatment alliance and creating a plan
that<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.789> can<00:00:42.969> both<00:00:43.149> move<00:00:43.420> forward<00:00:43.839> together

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
that you can both move forward together

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.560 
that you can both move forward together
on<00:00:44.440> it's<00:00:45.280> not<00:00:45.519> just<00:00:45.850> about<00:00:45.969> getting<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.449> right

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
on it's not just about getting the right

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.290 
on it's not just about getting the right
drug<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:48.280> people<00:00:48.609> are<00:00:48.699> involved<00:00:48.940> in<00:00:49.120> their

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
drug when people are involved in their

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.270 
drug when people are involved in their
care<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.870> whole<00:00:50.320> bunch<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.649> things<00:00:50.710> happen<00:00:51.190> I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
care a whole bunch of things happen I

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.490 
care a whole bunch of things happen I
think<00:00:51.549> they<00:00:51.879> follow<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.930> treatments<00:00:53.320> better

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
think they follow the treatments better

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.779 
think they follow the treatments better
because<00:00:53.769> they're<00:00:53.890> committed<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.339> them<00:00:54.549> I

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
because they're committed to them I

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.609 
because they're committed to them I
think<00:00:55.089> they<00:00:55.299> cope<00:00:55.870> with<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.170> treatments

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
think they cope with the treatments

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:57.899 
think they cope with the treatments
better<00:00:56.799> because<00:00:57.070> they<00:00:57.159> understand<00:00:57.699> what's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
better because they understand what's

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.689 
better because they understand what's
happening<00:00:58.360> I<00:00:58.570> think<00:00:59.140> they<00:00:59.500> are<00:00:59.769> able<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.399> live

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
happening I think they are able to live

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160 
happening I think they are able to live
with<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.030> treatments<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.659> different<00:01:02.019> way

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
with the treatments in a different way

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.779 
with the treatments in a different way
because<00:01:02.379> they<00:01:02.710> know<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:02.920> they<00:01:03.280> have<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.489> role

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
because they know that they have a role

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.910 
because they know that they have a role
in<00:01:04.089> determining<00:01:04.600> them<00:01:05.140> so<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.530> think<00:01:05.649> they're<00:01:05.890> a

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
in determining them so I think they're a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.830 
in determining them so I think they're a
whole<00:01:06.039> bunch<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.340> positive<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:10.300> reality<00:01:10.810> is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
whole bunch of positive the reality is

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.899 
whole bunch of positive the reality is
as<00:01:11.200> your<00:01:11.470> best<00:01:11.619> shot<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.009> if<00:01:12.159> you<00:01:12.520> go<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.759> the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
as your best shot is if you go to the

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.680 
as your best shot is if you go to the
place<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.179> has<00:01:13.479> all<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.869> resources<00:01:13.990> first

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
place that has all the resources first

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.480 
place that has all the resources first
patients<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:16.810> think<00:01:16.840> often<00:01:17.200> assume<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:18.009> they

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
patients I think often assume that they

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.520 
patients I think often assume that they
will<00:01:19.119> have<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.450> compromise<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.350> they

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
will have to compromise and that they

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.840 
will have to compromise and that they
should<00:01:20.560> go<00:01:21.159> for<00:01:21.429> somebody<00:01:21.580> who's<00:01:21.819> really

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
should go for somebody who's really

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.540 
should go for somebody who's really
technically<00:01:22.539> sophisticated<00:01:23.380> but<00:01:24.159> not<00:01:24.340> that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
technically sophisticated but not that

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.520 
technically sophisticated but not that
great<00:01:24.789> humanistic<00:01:25.270> alee<00:01:25.600> or<00:01:25.750> vice<00:01:25.960> versa<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
great humanistic alee or vice versa and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.740 
great humanistic alee or vice versa and
the<00:01:26.950> reality<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.429> not<00:01:27.670> true<00:01:27.909> at<00:01:28.030> all<00:01:28.090> patients

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the reality is not true at all patients

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.210 
the reality is not true at all patients
should<00:01:28.840> not<00:01:28.990> settle<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.350> them<00:01:29.619> they<00:01:30.159> should

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
should not settle for them they should

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.550 
should not settle for them they should
be<00:01:30.580> looking<00:01:30.759> for<00:01:31.090> at<00:01:31.149> all<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.929> best<00:01:32.140> work<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.500> do

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
be looking for at all the best work I do

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.260 
be looking for at all the best work I do
is<00:01:32.649> really<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.979> combination<00:01:33.220> about<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.090> feel

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
is really a combination about and I feel

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.719 
is really a combination about and I feel
like<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.110> challenge<00:01:35.770> for<00:01:35.979> physicians<00:01:36.610> in

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
like the the challenge for physicians in

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
like the the challenge for physicians in
our<00:01:36.850> time<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.720> integrate<00:01:38.140> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
our time is really to integrate the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.069 
our time is really to integrate the
humanistic<00:01:39.700> sides<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.270> care<00:01:40.539> with<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
humanistic sides of care with the

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.370 
humanistic sides of care with the
technical<00:01:41.439> side<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.829> care

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.630 

the<00:01:45.380> conversations<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:46.430> with

the conversations that I have with

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.940 
the conversations that I have with
people<00:01:46.760> are<00:01:47.090> as<00:01:47.270> important<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.410> treatment

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
people are as important to the treatment

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.190 
people are as important to the treatment
as<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.400> chemotherapy<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.060> we<00:01:50.330> get<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.690> for
