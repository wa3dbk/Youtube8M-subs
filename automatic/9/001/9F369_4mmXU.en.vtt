00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.110
 where 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.730
 Y 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.410
 no no no 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.380
 the following is the explanation of a 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.599
 real game session so you can 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.320
 contain incomplete instructions and 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.320
 some mistakes 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.689
 in this game we are beat wings doing 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.010
 caravans and the idea is to cross the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.420
 desert getting the most amount 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.489
 victory points and trying to 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.890
 block the others as they are the three 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.379
 players only I love playing in the area 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.570
 from here of the board its time in 45 it 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.450
 they also occupy the complete 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.250
 How do I know about story points? 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:55.460
 every time you and your caravan go to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 have the caravans and in your turn you go 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.780
 everything is to catch two camels 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.780
 of those available then by 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.700
 example if you choose one of these I have to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 put it attached to my caravan the same 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 color and so I'm doing the caravans 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 when I put a camel on a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.440
 water tab I got that tab what 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.120
 placed face down in front of me and it's just 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 point of interest that gives me or is 1 to 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.260
 3 another way to get a point 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.490
 success victory caravan touches 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.409
 an oasis 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.710
 you receive 5 points immediately 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.110
 history if the same caravan touches the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.700
 same so again they did not give you points 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.009
 again but if that face can not touch 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.170
 another so receive another 5 points you can 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.850
 touch that same ass with another of your 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.510
 caravans for example I could touch it 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.990
 with as a caravan nothing more than that for 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.250
 and those are the points immediately 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.500
 also 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 if I can make a circle 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.930
 so for example I do 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.750
 and I give an example 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.420
 I have absolutely surrounded this sector 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 without there being any camels in 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.050
 then I immediately take the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.120
 chips that are there and if I had not touched 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 this palm tree with that caravan also 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.020
 received five points and also at the end 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.390
 of the judgment a point for each space 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.709
 empty that there is in the sectors that I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.709
 have completely surrounded 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.950
 the wall of the board and on the mountain 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.450
 not because that would not be surrounded 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.080
 what things are important that obviously 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550
 If you have your caravan here, you can not 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.260
 put a camel of its value here because 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.600
 you can not touch two caravans of the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.160
 same color of different players 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.940
 because it would not be known to whom they belong 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.060
 horses 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.440
 if you can touch yourself with a caravan 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.050
 same color 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.569
 from another player but with one 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.760
 because there will not be confusion 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.620
 there is also a fund at the end of the game 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.290
 for the one with the largest caravan 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.730
 of each color are 10 points and the load 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.340
 larger is constituted by the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.820
 amount of camels that you have 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.820
 I could do this 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.780
 and in case of a tie in the amount of 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.780
 Most hair are 5 points 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.130
 and how the game gets the face 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.400
 party starting by placing each one in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.400
 the caravans 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.110
 but there is an additional rule and it is that 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.870
 you can place it on the water you can not 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.730
 place the points not like this and can not 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 place it next to other riders that is 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.030
 own 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.040
 and it's the nice miss 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.840
 is a fichita of the trees that do not 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.319
 they are complete are physical 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.319
 and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.459
 that is the humanist of the hair 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.769
 free except the first two 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.269
 players who put one's memory 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.440
 when the games start when the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.900
 forum 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.410
 the game is over when one is finished 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.150
 colors camel reserve 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.870
 and although 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.870
 so so
