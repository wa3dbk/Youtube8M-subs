00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.460
 andy via 68 today we are here to talk 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 of how to hack the firmware on the gf 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 between lumix we go to the personal site 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 we have to log you in and log you in then 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 sign up for the site go to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 top settings in that case like 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.149
 you can see from the window we have 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.010
 different setting options 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.790
 let's go over the flow motion which is that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.250
 that best suits the gf3 and let's go 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.300
 on page 1 where there will then be the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 various configurations here they are the powell e 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.730
 let's choose for example one of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.500
 these three configurations by clicking 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 you see that below in the bar will appear 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 let's say the start of the download 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.119
 and at that point we go for example here 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 on search and write pictures subi'to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.240
 if we go then on google 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.939
 we click on one of these two terms 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 and the page will automatically open 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.360
 having to do the painting download 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 colors 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.049
 we click and even started below 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.150
 the download of the people's good started 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 at this point the first a new tab 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.350
 go on google and look on google 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 the original lumix firmware 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 the last then the 1.2 schiano then 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:46.640
 lumix download gf tram firmware 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 let's go to research then click 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 in one of the let's say sites where yes 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.649
 then manages to view and download the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.310
 firmware to originate we sell on 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.310
 download 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.070
 at this point we can click 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.020
 see different types 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.090
 let's say machines we go to choose 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.780
 our gf3 we accept the discharge of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.910
 download 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.730
 at that point we go on the model that the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.890
 our gf3 and click on the page of 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.750
 download automatically there will be yes 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.240
 will open a mini screen where you can 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.370
 choose between windows and macintosh e 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.220
 We choose clearly depending on the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.209
 our machines in this case windows 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.100
 so I'll download for windows 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.470
 automatically down then in the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.959
 download page anyway and see i 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 our our downloads and ravenna 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.989
 this page inaccurately there are others 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
 from one I had done previously 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.080
 let's create a folder for example 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.410
 we write gf3 hack 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.590
 at that point we go and get ours 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.910
 file this will get that file where 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.989
 written if tg where there is the how it can be 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:11.600
 tell the firmware cracked at that 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:17.630
 point let's get the tools you will see 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.220
 that here are pictures we open it and there it is 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.130
 the little program instead to be able to 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.140
 deploy our gf3 then run 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.600
 as you can see the fencing appears 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.870
 tina where then they will go up i 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.630
 however we open different parameters 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.430
 another folder where you can then do a 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.070
 drag and drop 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.620
 so now let's go on 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.510
 our folder that made gf3 h 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.230
 let's put in the pitu we have 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.890
 downloaded our program then there 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.320
 we throw in the setting what 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.079
 identifies the crack we have 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.310
 downloaded 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.140
 let's get the movie of the operating system 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.500
 original 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.700
 then we run the original firmware 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.760
 unpack you see it is put a 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.209
 another another make a bean point and col 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.150
 our say with our original film 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.250
 open alpi tools load it at al 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.550
 firmware so let's look for the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.330
 our folder gf3 h 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.540
 in this case it is in I created it 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.850
 directly in download 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.500
 we load the original firmware and at that 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.600
 point below as you can see I am a 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.169
 lot of red dots and 1 green one 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.060
 green is let's say the movie we have 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.310
 installed that we put in the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.290
 folder by clicking the one as you can 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.050
 see there are changed parameters 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.060
 that will change ours ours 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.710
 gf3 not definitively but 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.199
 anyway so that they can be obtained 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:04.520
 results as very high bitrates 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.020
 at this point it will be enough to do save 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.510
 firmware 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.990
 as you see if written of f3 gf between 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.490
 bar v12 from oar for example gf3 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.560
 baretta v13 we save it and as you see 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.740
 will appear inside our folder 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.630
 it must be created already 3 hours later 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.550
 on subsequent we say changes yes 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.830
 will put you will save with the gf3 bar v 13 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.300
 14 15 etc. etc. in the way of 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.000
 to go 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.389
 let's say this progressively 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.949
 we say is the way to succeed 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.810
 grab our car 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.669
 at this point we will then put everything 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.389
 inside ours 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:51.800
 as you can see now I have inserted the card 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:54.830
 so a sd card we will put ours 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.479
 firmware accepted then the gf 3 bar 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:03.889
 v13 and insert it then the copy e 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:08.630
 we paste right on the initial part 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:12.250
 of our of our card well a 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.800
 let's go to our point 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.710
 machine on our gf tram 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.449
 we press we keep clearly put 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.110
 sd inside our car 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.800
 we press the play button until we do 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.409
 is displayed update 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.080
 start updating yes at that point 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.030
 will start the update and update the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.220
 firmware instead of the original one 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.629
 will put the one accepted here in 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.400
 configuration we downloaded 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.349
 with the features that we have 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 interested in us 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:48.340
 well at that point he finished the car 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.409
 will remain exactly as it was then not 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.970
 will change nothing the settings will remain 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.860
 always the same the only thing that 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.409
 it was clearly the quality of the 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.830
 filmed the cards I use that 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.599
 use we say for this kind of 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.580
 shootings that are much more we say a lot 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.949
 heavier than this the sun discs from 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.550
 32 gb and this is the site where I have it 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.500
 purchased and must at the lowest price e 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.129
 nothing this is all I thank you and 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.129
 to the next
