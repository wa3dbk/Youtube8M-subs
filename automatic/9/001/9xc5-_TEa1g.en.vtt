right<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.460> that's<00:01:51.880> because<00:01:52.090> he<00:01:52.660> bumped<00:01:53.020> into

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
right but that's because he bumped into

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.469 
right but that's because he bumped into
the<00:01:53.920> r-mo<00:01:54.220> statue<00:01:54.550> which<00:01:54.820> didn't<00:01:55.270> want<00:01:55.360> to

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
the r-mo statue which didn't want to

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.469 
the r-mo statue which didn't want to
move<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:57.430> clipped<00:01:57.640> him<00:01:57.789> out<00:01:57.910> of<00:01:58.000> bounds<00:01:58.090> it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
move and it clipped him out of bounds it

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.760 
move and it clipped him out of bounds it
should<00:01:58.780> have<00:01:58.960> clipped<00:01:59.229> him<00:01:59.380> out<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.649> bounds

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
should have clipped him out of bounds

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.650 
should have clipped him out of bounds
and<00:02:00.070> clipped<00:02:00.250> back<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:00.580> okay<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.360> we'll<00:02:01.479> do<00:02:01.570> it

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
and clipped back in okay so we'll do it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.870 
and clipped back in okay so we'll do it
one<00:02:01.780> more<00:02:01.810> time<00:02:01.960> press<00:02:02.890> left<00:02:03.160> moves<00:02:03.640> right

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.450 

that's<00:02:34.410> one<00:02:34.650> thing<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.280> been

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
that's one thing that I have been

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.430 
that's one thing that I have been
finding<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.060> really<00:02:36.420> dislike<00:02:36.660> about<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
finding that I really dislike about the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.860 
finding that I really dislike about the
Wii<00:02:37.590> U<00:02:37.770> version<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:39.030> order<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.750> be

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
Wii U version is that in order to be

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200 
Wii U version is that in order to be
ready<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.410> play<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.950> game<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.610> was<00:02:41.910> playing

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
ready to play this game I was playing

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.520 
ready to play this game I was playing
the<00:02:42.330> Wind<00:02:42.540> Waker<00:02:42.750> GameCube<00:02:43.680> version<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.940> ton

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the Wind Waker GameCube version of ton

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.080 
the Wind Waker GameCube version of ton
which<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:48.360> made<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:50.340> used<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
which just made it so I'm used to the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.120 
which just made it so I'm used to the
control<00:02:51.630> scheme<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> GameCube<00:02:53.100> version

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
control scheme on the GameCube version

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:21.670 
control scheme on the GameCube version
and<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:55.350> been<00:02:55.620> confusing

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.679

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.809 
 don't hit that pillar if I go in
the<00:03:32.120> water<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:32.540> not<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.840> end<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.260> world

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
the water it's not the end of the world

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.119 
the water it's not the end of the world
as<00:03:34.819> long<00:03:35.000> as<00:03:35.180> them<00:03:35.319> as<00:03:36.319> long<00:03:36.439> as<00:03:36.500> I'm<00:03:36.680> still<00:03:36.950> in

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
as long as them as long as I'm still in

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.750 
as long as them as long as I'm still in
the<00:03:37.310> water

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
the water

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.039 
the water
so<00:03:37.879> you<00:03:37.939> swim<00:03:38.269> right<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.569> where<00:03:38.689> the<00:03:38.720> stairs

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
so you swim right to where the stairs

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.009 
so you swim right to where the stairs
would<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:39.409> clip<00:03:40.340> through<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.640> stairs<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
would be clip through the stairs and

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.979 
would be clip through the stairs and
you're<00:03:42.319> done<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.819> can<00:03:43.909> continue<00:03:44.329> onward<00:03:44.720> with

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
you're done you can continue onward with

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.009 
you're done you can continue onward with
the<00:03:45.200> dungeon<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.220> that's<00:03:46.370> pretty<00:03:46.549> much<00:03:46.640> it

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
the dungeon so that's pretty much it
