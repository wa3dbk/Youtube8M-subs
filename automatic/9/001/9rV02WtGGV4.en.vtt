00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.859 
you probably saw my little cup battle
there<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.740> usually<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.420> low<00:00:21.660> cut

Fowler<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.590> today<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.310> bringing

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Fowler so today I'm going to be bringing

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.570 
Fowler so today I'm going to be bringing
you<00:00:23.730> loca<00:00:24.180> battle<00:00:24.510> against<00:00:24.840> eb<00:00:25.140> girl<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you loca battle against eb girl and in

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.009 
you loca battle against eb girl and in
the<00:00:26.699> team<00:00:26.910> preview<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.750> she<00:00:27.900> has<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the team preview I see that she has a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.200 
the team preview I see that she has a
pharaoh<00:00:28.320> seed<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> figure<00:00:29.369> that's<00:00:29.490> probably

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pharaoh seed so I figure that's probably

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.830 
pharaoh seed so I figure that's probably
the<00:00:30.420> most<00:00:30.599> viable<00:00:31.140> lead<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.130> um<00:00:32.579> team<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the most viable lead in this um team so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.709 
the most viable lead in this um team so
I<00:00:33.870> figured<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.500> best<00:00:34.950> bet<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.489> now<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> my

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
I figured my best bet right now is my

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
I figured my best bet right now is my
snouffer<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.710> I've<00:00:37.860> hidden<00:00:38.160> power<00:00:38.460> fire

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
snouffer because I've hidden power fire

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
snouffer because I've hidden power fire
on<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.960> also<00:00:40.140> scarf<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.280> case

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
on it and I'm also scarf just in case

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.760 
on it and I'm also scarf just in case
she<00:00:41.879> brings<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.690> something<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
she brings in something other than that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
she brings in something other than that
I'm<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.430> speed<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> hit<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
I'm my out speed and you know hit it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
I'm my out speed and you know hit it
with<00:00:46.620> super<00:00:47.010> effective<00:00:47.219> move<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.760> she<00:00:47.850> goes

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with super effective move so she goes

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
with super effective move so she goes
into<00:00:48.360> blitz<00:00:48.780> oh<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> figure<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.710> go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
into blitz oh and I figure out just go

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.000 
into blitz oh and I figure out just go
for<00:00:50.750> blizzard<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:52.020> off<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> bat<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> guess

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
for blizzard right off the bat I guess

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
for blizzard right off the bat I guess
she<00:00:53.160> wasn't<00:00:53.340> expecting<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.360> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
she wasn't expecting that because I just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
she wasn't expecting that because I just
took<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.989> thing<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
took that thing right out and here I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
took that thing right out and here I
switching<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.570> my<00:00:57.690> bronzer<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.859> I'm

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
switching to my bronzer because I'm

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.880 
switching to my bronzer because I'm
expecting<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> fake-out<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
expecting the fake-out and you know I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
expecting the fake-out and you know I
didn't<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.850> faked<00:01:03.210> out

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
didn't really want to get faked out

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
didn't really want to get faked out
because<00:01:03.960> snow<00:01:04.260> her<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:04.890> frail<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because snow her is pretty frail so I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
because snow her is pretty frail so I
want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> save<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.180> snow<00:01:06.570> over<00:01:06.720> flater<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> think

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
want to save my snow over flater I think

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's my only scarfed pokemon on this
team<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.869> she<00:01:10.619> ends<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:10.950> switching<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
team so she ends up switching and I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700 
team so she ends up switching and I
think<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.750> his<00:01:12.869> psychic<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.470> no

think I just go for his psychic here no

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
think I just go for his psychic here no
I'd<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> stealth<00:01:14.909> frog<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'd go for the stealth frog this is my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.219 
I'd go for the stealth frog this is my
stealth<00:01:16.140> rocker<00:01:16.500> instead<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.430> um<00:01:18.229> would

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
stealth rocker instead of my um would

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
stealth rocker instead of my um would
you<00:01:19.259> McCall<00:01:19.619> instead<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.369> setup<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.210> i<00:01:21.330> do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you McCall instead of my setup but i do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
you McCall instead of my setup but i do
have<00:01:21.750> psychic<00:01:22.259> though<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> she<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.890> probably

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
have psychic though so she was probably

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
have psychic though so she was probably
scared<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> psychic<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.479> i<00:01:24.509> did<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.990> my

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

stayed<00:01:40.020> another<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.560> set<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.159> spikes

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
stayed another way set up more spikes

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.330 
stayed another way set up more spikes
but<00:01:42.079> I'm<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.259> too<00:01:43.470> worried<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.009> right

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
but I'm not too worried about that right

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850 
but I'm not too worried about that right
now<00:01:44.399> especially<00:01:45.049> since<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.290> carry<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> fire

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
now especially since I carry the fire

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
now especially since I carry the fire
blast<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.399> she<00:01:47.579> predicts<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.390> she<00:01:48.540> goes

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
blast but she predicts that and she goes

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
blast but she predicts that and she goes
into<00:01:48.899> her<00:01:49.079> ponyta<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:50.070> has<00:01:50.280> flash<00:01:50.610> fire<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
into her ponyta which has flash fire so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.760 
into her ponyta which has flash fire so
that's<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.049> good<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.439> me<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.560> now

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that's really not good for me right now

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.910 
that's really not good for me right now
and<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:54.240> figure<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and I figure I'm just gonna go for the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.270 
and I figure I'm just gonna go for the
earthquake<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.079> order<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> kill<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.950> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
earthquake now in order to kill it so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.950 
earthquake now in order to kill it so
even<00:01:59.670> though<00:01:59.700> she<00:01:59.850> breaks<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.479> sub<00:02:00.750> I'm

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
even though she breaks my sub I'm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740 
even though she breaks my sub I'm
definitely<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.920> able<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.420> out

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
definitely going to be able to take out

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.470 
definitely going to be able to take out
the<00:02:04.469> ponyta<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.700> an<00:02:06.000> earthquake

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
the ponyta with an earthquake

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.220 
the ponyta with an earthquake
so<00:02:07.700> uh<00:02:08.700> gibbehhhh<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.510> doing<00:02:09.810> work<00:02:09.960> right<00:02:10.200> now

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
so uh gibbehhhh was doing work right now

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.550 
so uh gibbehhhh was doing work right now
but<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.650> still<00:02:10.680> need<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.070> save<00:02:11.370> gibble<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.780> my

but I still need to save gibble and my

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
but I still need to save gibble and my

Pharaoh seed so I go into micro gun care
i<00:04:05.940> figure<00:04:06.450> i<00:04:06.480> think<00:04:06.989> i'm<00:04:07.170> gonna<00:04:07.320> fake<00:04:07.709> out

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
i figure i think i'm gonna fake out

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.080 
i figure i think i'm gonna fake out
and<00:04:09.110> if<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.860> doesn't<00:04:10.250> kill<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.700> it's

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
and if that doesn't kill I it's

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.480 
and if that doesn't kill I it's
definitely<00:04:11.690> not<00:04:11.840> going<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.110> kill<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:12.590> it's

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
definitely not going to kill but it's

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.340 
definitely not going to kill but it's
going<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.970> enough<00:04:14.300> damage<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.110> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
going to do enough damage so that the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.910 
going to do enough damage so that the
hail<00:04:15.910> plus<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.300> vacuum<00:04:17.959> wave<00:04:18.230> is<00:04:18.560> going<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.800> be

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
hail plus a vacuum wave is going to be

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.260 
hail plus a vacuum wave is going to be
able<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.190> kill<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.610> didn't<00:04:19.850> want<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.090> risk

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
able to kill it I didn't want to risk

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.880 
able to kill it I didn't want to risk
going<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.780> sucker<00:04:21.020> punch<00:04:21.170> now<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.739> she's

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
going for the sucker punch now and she's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.500 
going for the sucker punch now and she's
still<00:04:22.040> had<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> substitute<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:23.180> she<00:04:23.330> could

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
still had a substitute that she could

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.110 
still had a substitute that she could
have<00:04:23.600> used<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.290> she<00:04:25.010> goes<00:04:25.160> into<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.760> British

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
have used so she goes into this British

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.500 
have used so she goes into this British
and<00:04:27.220> British<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.370> just<00:04:28.520> go<00:04:28.640> for<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.880> dark<00:04:29.240> pulse

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
and British I just go for the dark pulse

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.580 
and British I just go for the dark pulse
I<00:04:30.470> expected<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.460> do<00:04:31.730> more<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.590> it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
I expected that to do more and it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.860 
I expected that to do more and it
doesn't<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:34.310> she<00:04:34.730> goes<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.150> recovery<00:04:35.480> I

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
doesn't but she goes for the recovery I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.360 
doesn't but she goes for the recovery I
guess<00:04:36.170> she<00:04:36.320> was<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:36.440> gauging<00:04:36.860> how<00:04:37.130> much

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
guess she was just gauging how much

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.720 
guess she was just gauging how much
damage<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.390> going<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.600> do<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.640> kind<00:04:40.640> of

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
damage it was going to do and kind of

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.230 
damage it was going to do and kind of
stalling<00:04:41.180> in<00:04:41.540> a<00:04:41.630> way<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.840> because<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:43.490> hail<00:04:43.790> is

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
stalling in a way to because the hail is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.380 
stalling in a way to because the hail is
um<00:04:44.780> taking<00:04:45.530> damage<00:04:46.190> on<00:04:46.550> both<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.760> us<00:04:46.970> but<00:04:47.030> she

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
um taking damage on both of us but she

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.560 
um taking damage on both of us but she
could<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:47.690> probably<00:04:48.140> stalled<00:04:48.980> me<00:04:49.250> out<00:04:49.570> but

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
could have probably stalled me out but

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.570 
could have probably stalled me out but
in<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:50.960> case<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.590> guess<00:04:51.770> she<00:04:51.980> felt<00:04:52.190> was<00:04:52.280> safe

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
in this case I guess she felt was safe

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.190 
in this case I guess she felt was safe
enough<00:04:52.700> for<00:04:52.850> her<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.210> go<00:04:53.300> for<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.510> hex<00:04:53.810> and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
enough for her to go for the hex and

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.890 
enough for her to go for the hex and
take<00:04:54.470> me<00:04:54.650> out<00:04:54.680> however<00:04:55.130> since<00:04:56.060> she's<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.420> very

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
take me out however since she's a very

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.270 
take me out however since she's a very
little<00:04:57.260> hip<00:04:57.410> points<00:04:57.800> it's<00:04:57.980> going<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.160> be

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
little hip points it's going to be

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.220 
little hip points it's going to be
enough<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.760> my<00:04:58.880> gibble<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.570> be<00:04:59.690> able<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.020> take

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.050
