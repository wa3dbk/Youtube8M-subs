00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 before starting the video I wanted to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.200
 wish you a happy 2013 and that the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.599
 next Sunday a video and also 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.599
 I will make a gift video for all my 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 Subscribers and visitors supposed 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.750
 decreased its performance if that is your 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.750
 problem here is the solution 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 now all of youtube lie in these 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 tutorials I will teach why for the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.090
 pc performance some solutions 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 and possible causes the possible causes 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is the most common problem between 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 users can have many reasons 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.199
 that explain a drop in performance 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 of the pc fragmented data presence of 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.629
 speed guard corrupt registry and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 unnecessary programs 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.430
 the solution checks the programs that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.860
 we have installed and uninstalled those that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.129
 do not use delete unnecessary files 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.019
 and gain speed and performance either 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.780
 of fragmenting the disk or 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.549
 adding memory to the machine to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 I'm going to show you how to see 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.350
 the programs that we have installed in 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 the pc how to uninstall them and how 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 Defragment the good disc and leave them 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:24.510
 as forget hello everyone below 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 I will show you how to watch the programs 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.280
 that are installed on the pc and how is it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 install them the first thing we have to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.140
 to do is go to janis 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.969
 control panel and then add or 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.179
 remove programs will show a 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.119
 window which we have to wait for 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:46.179
 that you charge if you want that fast karel of 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.060
 you remove the check mark to show 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.850
 updates like this will only search and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 will read the programs and return the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 will display faster 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.850
 ok do not get out of this you'll see 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.660
 all the programs that have also 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.090
 the good pc here you can see it for 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.450
 remove a program you just have to do 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.570
 click on the kit ar and now I'm going 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 to teach how to fragment the disc what 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.070
 first is that the first thing we have 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 what to do is the irish and all 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.910
 accessory programs system sheets 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.230
 and from disk fragmenter we click on 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.230
 a screen will open 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.050
 a call window commented on ready 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.200
 what we are going to do is analyze the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.760
 disk 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.159
 It may take a while depending 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.200
 which sees how much time they have 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.819
 measurements fragment it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.460
 look, I finished the analysis 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.060
 when the analysis ends 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.020
 you click on three fragment will begin 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.020
 to fragment 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.380
 automatically 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.250
 and we must wait 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.610
 when it's over and that's all after returning 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 the video
