00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
nice own world and not like that but I

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.260 
nice own world and not like that but I
think<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.690> mean<00:01:40.869> it's<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.460> classic

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
think I mean it's it's like classic

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.359 
think I mean it's it's like classic
which<00:01:43.750> suits<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.229> place<00:01:44.560> but<00:01:45.039> then<00:01:45.220> also

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
which suits the place but then also

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.029 
which suits the place but then also
modern<00:01:45.880> which<00:01:46.060> creates<00:01:46.630> like<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.929> contrast<00:01:47.590> so

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
modern which creates like a contrast so

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.460 
modern which creates like a contrast so
i<00:01:48.070> think<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.570> fantastic

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470

by the 360 degrees class and blast turns

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.940 
by the 360 degrees class and blast turns
to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> mirror<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.740> see

to be kind of like a mirror so we see

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.220 
to be kind of like a mirror so we see
the<00:02:35.100> light<00:02:35.250> everywhere<00:02:35.820> sighs<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> light<00:02:36.960> we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the light everywhere sighs the light we

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.480 
the light everywhere sighs the light we
have<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> smoke<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.950> everything<00:02:38.010> everything

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
have the smoke and everything everything

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.940 
have the smoke and everything everything
has<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.760> time<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:40.050> really<00:02:40.350> worst

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
has to be time so this is a really worst

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.040 
has to be time so this is a really worst
case<00:02:41.220> location<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.300> beautiful<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.990> it's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
case location it's beautiful but it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.900 
case location it's beautiful but it's
going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.590> tricky<00:02:49.400> three<00:02:50.400> very<00:02:50.610> powerful

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
going to be tricky three very powerful

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390 
going to be tricky three very powerful
yeah<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.650> think<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.100> be<00:02:53.130> something

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
yeah and I think it would be something

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.950 
yeah and I think it would be something
that<00:02:53.550> actually<00:02:53.910> we've<00:02:54.300> never<00:02:54.570> done<00:02:54.750> before

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
that actually we've never done before

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.130 
that actually we've never done before
either<00:02:55.440> no<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.610> motion<00:02:56.970> picture<00:02:57.660> vs

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
either no this is like motion picture vs

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.020 
either no this is like motion picture vs
fashion<00:02:58.410> video<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> think<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.820> is<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
fashion video so I think this is the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.160 
fashion video so I think this is the
most<00:03:00.150> cinematic<00:03:00.840> we've<00:03:01.290> gone

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.230
