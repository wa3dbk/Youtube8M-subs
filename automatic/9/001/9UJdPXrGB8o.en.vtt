00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.200 
because failure makes you want to work
harder<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:34.189> could<00:06:34.430> make<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.610> want<00:06:34.909> to<00:06:34.939> give<00:06:35.089> up

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
harder it could make you want to give up

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.579 
harder it could make you want to give up
but<00:06:35.240> it<00:06:35.419> can<00:06:35.569> make<00:06:35.750> you<00:06:35.930> realize<00:06:36.229> what<00:06:36.439> is

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
but it can make you realize what is

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.409 
but it can make you realize what is
important<00:06:37.129> and<00:06:37.279> what<00:06:37.370> are<00:06:37.939> things<00:06:38.060> that<00:06:38.270> you

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
important and what are things that you

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.689 
important and what are things that you
really<00:06:38.449> do<00:06:39.050> want<00:06:39.469> and<00:06:39.770> things<00:06:40.460> that<00:06:40.580> you

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
really do want and things that you
