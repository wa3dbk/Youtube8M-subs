00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello youtube welcome to a short 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.820
 comparison video between the old one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.519
 iphone 4s and the brand new apple 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.870
 iphone 5 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 I will not at all large rum laber only 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.430
 so what am I after after the first 24 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.109
 hours with the device is noticed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.590
 as for me, the conversion was short 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.630
 I just believe me 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.189
 get along with it very well the first 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 What strikes you when you get the new one 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.349
 iphone gets boah is that easily the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 screen this elongated puzzled 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.120
 One in the first moment one thinks oneself 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 not really a bit too 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 have to broaden 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 the answer to that is no I can 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 wonderful I have one again and again 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.079
 the whole video and and videos 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 Suppress that praised as everywhere 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.620
 here easily turn get on the iphone 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 this is true only here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 Difference is if I'm with now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 right , it's a bit 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 become awkward denon on switch 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 in between, well maybe I have to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 then just a little more agile 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.549
 so it will be fit for me 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.830
 would make the difference directly again 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 remember and yes I can definitely say 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.020
 the old iPhone is a now a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.979
 whole corner heavier so euro only 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 muscles will continue to degenerate 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.220
 of the division button or so must 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 I was not tall because that says 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 clearly equal if you now the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 all the time people are coming towards you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 iphone iso where show up here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 but then it is people who 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.390
 want to show you the new backside around 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.159
 to show clearly 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.960
 yes i have a new iphone also there 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.360
 it's a funny trick if you think 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.860
 but I have to keep up with that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 just in that your your old iphone 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.090
 just keep up or still 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.570
 further from this I already have the iphone 7 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.820
 with 28 inches no matter front camera is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 this is changed now 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.240
 sensor is no longer strictly the as 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.610
 laage has become a circle to the side 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.469
 everything has always made sense 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.320
 not really a difference 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.299
 for me if i'm around so face time 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.920
 I always look that face time anyway 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.180
 then because you are not in the camera 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.740
 looks but on the screen to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.959
 opposite and actually looks 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.370
 So clever is going to be right 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.520
 the problem is probably solved 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.770
 first 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.410
 if there are either multiple cameras 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.820
 or the front camera under the display 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.770
 it hides because back pages 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.420
 buttons, we then have the advantages 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.040
 of course , it's obvious I got it 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.710
 said from the outset for me was the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.560
 Buying reason of the new iphones a row 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.150
 more buttons and that turns out to be true 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.220
 now here with me also spotify or 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.020
 wants instagram are advanced and now 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.490
 just google maps just know 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.580
 just always a lot of nice comparison 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.890
 and always switch back and forth 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.720
 so how is the bigger one ? 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.860
 screen concrete notes example 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.950
 Just look at both safari browsers 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.320
 technology loaded the side and see 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.870
 you already clear the main difference 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.120
 the width remains the same but down 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.100
 There is more space now means you 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 can here that the thumbnail and the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 completely see the article and even more 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.170
 the title of the next article 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.780
 then for comparison times twitter here 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.730
 last mentioned 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.490
 same game I'll get him there 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.010
 Here I have the third gmbh the 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.630
 direct interaction so a bit 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.430
 on it or the filter pieces have it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.470
 on top of it and a whole corner of 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.310
 Next, at least I have the text 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.400
 can see so that's who I'm 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.330
 just look at the latest tweets 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.670
 and so he got lucky now 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.080
 to watch TV 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.880
 same games here the third offender 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.880
 cut off here is completely there 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.370
 and the next one too 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.580
 Overview gets here a tweet for free 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.680
 I want it longer now , so to speak 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.240
 Also do not tell big that's easy 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.220
 only the first overview with the 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.140
 Akkulaufzeit I am very satisfied there 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.900
 I think clearly now something to remember 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.060
 well maybe that's just the reason 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.680
 now after a year again a new one 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.450
 to have a battery and by that maybe 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.660
 again a few minutes more 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.709
 rauszuholen 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.810
 Otherwise, the conversion is still for me 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.250
 nothing noticed the rest of me 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.190
 it is noticeable that they are more google 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.620
 Maps so rather an apple maps so 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.479
 rather ios six things 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.030
 yes, that was it, too 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.130
 So first, it makes a lot of iphone 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.169
 5 videos corp still follow i torture you 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.210
 but also do not worry ios 67 videos 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.400
 the days will continue to follow 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.320
 and a few others 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.620
 videos make it good and see you next 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.620
 times
