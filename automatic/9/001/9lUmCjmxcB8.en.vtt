00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
and then you raise the body up as much

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.979 
and then you raise the body up as much
as<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.130> get<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.550> then<00:02:25.300> you're<00:02:25.870> going

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
as you can get it and then you're going

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.900 
as you can get it and then you're going
to<00:02:26.050> want<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.290> drop<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.890> down<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.400> low<00:02:27.610> as<00:02:27.640> you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
to want to drop this down as low as you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.729 
to want to drop this down as low as you
can<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.300> basically<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.620> it's

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
can get it basically so that it's

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.820 
can get it basically so that it's
sitting<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.250> ground<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.530> that's<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.739> to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
sitting on the ground so that's going to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.040 
sitting on the ground so that's going to
bring<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.220> off<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.790> be<00:02:34.239> careful<00:02:34.630> not<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.930> be

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
bring this off and be careful not to be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.400 
bring this off and be careful not to be
too<00:02:35.080> close<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:36.100> case<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.580> flies<00:02:36.850> out<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
too close just in case it flies out and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.650 
too close just in case it flies out and
to<00:02:39.069> remind<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.519> again<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:40.000> would<00:02:40.510> not

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
to remind you again I would not

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.259 
to remind you again I would not
recommend<00:02:40.989> doing<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.680> way<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.910> for

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
recommend doing it this way but for

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.600 
recommend doing it this way but for
people<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.630> don't<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:45.010> know<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
people that don't have you know one to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.640 
people that don't have you know one to
three<00:02:45.910> hundred<00:02:46.030> dollars<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:47.110> go<00:02:47.230> spend<00:02:47.530> on

three hundred dollars to to go spend on

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.759 
three hundred dollars to to go spend on
a<00:02:47.680> one-time-use<00:02:48.190> compressor<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
a one-time-use compressor this is the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.070 
a one-time-use compressor this is the
best<00:02:50.980> way<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:53.880> raise<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.330> lower

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
best way to do it so raise this up lower

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.259 
best way to do it so raise this up lower
this<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:58.140> eventually<00:02:59.140> it'll<00:02:59.560> come<00:02:59.799> out<00:03:00.269> so

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
this and eventually it'll come out so

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.759 
this and eventually it'll come out so
you're<00:03:01.390> going<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.540> want<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.750> put<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:01.959> your

you're going to want to put your your
rubber<00:03:03.459> grommet<00:03:03.940> here<00:03:04.329> in<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:05.320> this<00:03:05.560> in

rubber grommet here in with this in

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.600 
rubber grommet here in with this in
between<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.489> your<00:03:07.030> spacer<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.690> your<00:03:08.200> spring

between the your spacer and your spring

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.180 
between the your spacer and your spring
get<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.970> there<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.510> then<00:03:11.170> get<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> top

frame and bolt everything back up and

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.530 
frame and bolt everything back up and
you're<00:03:36.010> good<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.250> go<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.150> fairly<00:03:37.390> easy

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
you're good to go it's a fairly easy

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.930 
you're good to go it's a fairly easy
process<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.470> took<00:03:38.650> me<00:03:38.859> two<00:03:39.100> days<00:03:39.130> but<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.790> was

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
process it took me two days but that was

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.340 
process it took me two days but that was
because<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.480> my<00:03:40.630> first<00:03:40.840> time<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.320> I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
because it was my first time and I

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.370 
because it was my first time and I
didn't<00:03:41.620> have<00:03:41.829> any<00:03:42.579> any<00:03:43.510> videos<00:03:43.930> or<00:03:43.959> anything

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
didn't have any any videos or anything

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.330 
didn't have any any videos or anything
to<00:03:44.709> look<00:03:44.859> at<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:46.709> basically<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.890> do<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.160> same

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
to look at so basically you do the same

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.610 
to look at so basically you do the same
thing<00:03:48.640> on<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.239> side<00:03:49.299> only<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:50.200> don't<00:03:50.410> have

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
thing on this side only you don't have

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.690 
thing on this side only you don't have
to<00:03:50.829> pull<00:03:51.730> off<00:03:51.940> your<00:03:52.120> track<00:03:52.450> bar<00:03:53.100> because<00:03:54.100> your

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
to pull off your track bar because your

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.599 
to pull off your track bar because your
track<00:03:54.970> bar<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:56.130> connected<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> your<00:03:57.280> frame

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
track bar is connected to your frame

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.599 
track bar is connected to your frame
here<00:03:58.030> not<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.600> axial<00:03:59.049> down<00:03:59.170> here<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.250> just

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
here not the axial down here so just

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.009 
here not the axial down here so just
take<00:04:01.390> off<00:04:01.569> this<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.530> nut<00:04:03.190> right<00:04:03.400> here<00:04:03.430> and

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
take off this this nut right here and

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.189 
take off this this nut right here and
then<00:04:05.760> take<00:04:06.760> off<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.180> nut<00:04:07.449> right<00:04:07.660> there<00:04:07.900> for

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
then take off that nut right there for

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.949 
then take off that nut right there for
the<00:04:08.290> steering<00:04:08.919> arm<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.419> one's<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.750> lot

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the steering arm and this one's a lot

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.390 
the steering arm and this one's a lot
easier<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.500> don't<00:04:11.829> have<00:04:11.979> to<00:04:12.130> lift

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
easier you don't have to lift

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.300 
easier you don't have to lift
the<00:04:12.610> body<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:13.060> high<00:04:13.680> underneath<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.920> because

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the body is high underneath that because

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.920 
the body is high underneath that because
you<00:04:15.459> don't<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.909> track<00:04:16.209> bar<00:04:16.389> holding

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you don't have that track bar holding

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.890 
you don't have that track bar holding
the<00:04:17.049> axle<00:04:17.470> up<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.840> I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
the axle up so this is the one that I

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.409 
the axle up so this is the one that I
started<00:04:20.290> with<00:04:20.470> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.829> driver<00:04:21.070> side<00:04:21.300> and<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
started with on the driver side and it

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.950 
started with on the driver side and it
was<00:04:22.539> is<00:04:22.840> pretty<00:04:23.199> easy<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.970> bolts<00:04:25.300> easily

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
was is pretty easy that the bolts easily

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.529 
was is pretty easy that the bolts easily
accessible<00:04:26.530> right<00:04:26.650> there<00:04:26.949> I<00:04:27.130> would<00:04:27.820> use<00:04:28.180> an

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
accessible right there I would use an

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.480 
accessible right there I would use an
extension<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.139> come<00:04:29.320> up<00:04:29.470> through<00:04:29.710> through

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
extension to come up through through

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.060 
extension to come up through through
these<00:04:30.669> these<00:04:31.060> pipes<00:04:31.389> right<00:04:31.570> here<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.560> wrench

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
these these pipes right here just wrench

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.050 
these these pipes right here just wrench
it<00:04:33.190> off<00:04:33.310> right<00:04:33.490> there<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:36.370> probably<00:04:36.669> need<00:04:37.030> a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
it off right there you probably need a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.409 
it off right there you probably need a
breaker<00:04:37.360> bar<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.070> use<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.100> exact<00:04:39.699> size<00:04:40.060> for

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
breaker bar and use the exact size for

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.390 
breaker bar and use the exact size for
your<00:04:40.539> nuts<00:04:40.810> because<00:04:41.110> otherwise<00:04:42.039> you're<00:04:42.310> going

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
your nuts because otherwise you're going

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.890 
your nuts because otherwise you're going

to strip them out we're going to have

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.830 
to strip them out we're going to have
yourself<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.289> big<00:04:44.530> problem<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.690> go
