00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.140 
hair without one conditioner under it
and<00:00:33.780> again<00:00:34.380> I've<00:00:34.650> been<00:00:34.980> using<00:00:35.220> this<00:00:35.910> system

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
and again I've been using this system

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.670 
and again I've been using this system
while<00:00:36.450> doing<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> curly<00:00:36.900> girl<00:00:37.110> method<00:00:37.140> for

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
while doing the curly girl method for

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
while doing the curly girl method for
almost<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.100> years<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.239> my<00:00:39.510> hair<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.809> going

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
almost two years now so my hair is going

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
almost two years now so my hair is going
to<00:00:40.050> take<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.530> bit<00:00:40.649> differently<00:00:41.039> to<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to take a little bit differently to this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.639 
to take a little bit differently to this
so<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.120> may<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.690> where<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.050> eliminating

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so you may that's where I'm eliminating

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.990 
so you may that's where I'm eliminating
that<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:44.039> I<00:00:44.129> feel<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.699> hair<00:00:44.969> is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that because I feel like my hair is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840 
that because I feel like my hair is
owned<00:00:45.440> as<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.579> still

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
owned as I go out it's just still

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
owned as I go out it's just still
absorbing<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.600> much<00:00:48.719> moisture<00:00:49.199> which<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
absorbing so much moisture which is a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
absorbing so much moisture which is a
wonderful<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.340> won't<00:00:51.300> complain<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
wonderful thing won't complain about it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.650 
wonderful thing won't complain about it
but<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.760> seems<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
but it just seems like I don't really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
but it just seems like I don't really
need<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.469> conditioner<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.129> hair

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340

need the one conditioner in my hair
anymore<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.989> don't<00:00:58.199> leave<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
anymore and so I really don't leave it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.130 
anymore and so I really don't leave it
in<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.489> using<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.210> without<00:01:00.629> one

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.270 
on my hand but I have to say in the time

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
that I applied this product without the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
that I applied this product without the
one<00:02:19.460> conditioner<00:02:19.910> under<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.480> actually

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
one conditioner under it I actually

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.100 
one conditioner under it I actually
really<00:02:21.320> liked<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:22.630> didn't<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.930> thought

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
really liked it I didn't think I thought

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.420 
really liked it I didn't think I thought
there<00:02:24.290> was<00:02:24.350> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.680> huge<00:02:24.980> difference

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
there was going to be a huge difference

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.970 
there was going to be a huge difference
as<00:02:25.550> far<00:02:25.580> as<00:02:25.820> me<00:02:26.120> having<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:27.320> feel<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.860> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
as far as me having that feel of the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.880 
as far as me having that feel of the
hair<00:02:28.130> being<00:02:28.430> covered<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.140> some<00:02:30.320> reason<00:02:30.740> I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
hair being covered but for some reason I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.650 
hair being covered but for some reason I
don't<00:02:30.950> feel<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.580> way<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.000> said<00:02:32.330> wow<00:02:32.450> I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
don't feel that way and I said wow I

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.200 
don't feel that way and I said wow I
guess<00:02:32.900> I've<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.110> been<00:02:33.520> again<00:02:34.520> overusing

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
guess I've just been again overusing

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.840 
guess I've just been again overusing
product<00:02:35.950> because<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.100> definitely<00:02:37.370> wasn't

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
product because it definitely wasn't

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.680 
product because it definitely wasn't
necessary<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:39.610> find<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.880> foamed<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
necessary I find that it foamed a little

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.150 
necessary I find that it foamed a little
bit<00:02:41.810> more<00:02:42.050> like<00:02:42.560> I'm<00:02:42.710> getting<00:02:42.980> little

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
bit more like I'm getting little

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.880 
bit more like I'm getting little
fullness<00:02:43.490> between<00:02:44.030> my<00:02:44.180> fingers<00:02:44.890> whereas

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
fullness between my fingers whereas

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.790 
fullness between my fingers whereas
normally<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.280> don't<00:02:46.430> get<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.880> with<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:50.800> okay

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
normally I don't get that with this okay

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.610 
normally I don't get that with this okay
and<00:02:52.060> again<00:02:53.060> I'm<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.270> going<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.750> use<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> tiny

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and again I'm just going to use a tiny

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.250 
and again I'm just going to use a tiny
bit<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.880> see<00:02:56.060> it's<00:02:56.270> just<00:02:56.330> dripping<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:57.020> of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
bit you see it's just dripping out of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.850 
bit you see it's just dripping out of
the<00:02:57.380> grapeseed<00:02:57.980> oil<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.500> I'm<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:00.680> putting

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the grapeseed oil and I'm just putting

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.790 
the grapeseed oil and I'm just putting
it<00:03:01.070> over<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.340> top<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.080> did<00:03:03.260> cause<00:03:03.500> some

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
it over the top and it did cause some

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.580 
it over the top and it did cause some
white<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.550> my<00:03:04.820> hair<00:03:05.180> but<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.990> seems<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.440> it

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
white in my hair but it seems like it

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.580 
white in my hair but it seems like it
just<00:03:06.620> disappears<00:03:07.310> oh<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> other<00:03:09.410> thing

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
just disappears oh and the other thing

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.100 
just disappears oh and the other thing
is<00:03:10.010> because<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:11.270> already<00:03:11.630> shown<00:03:11.900> this
