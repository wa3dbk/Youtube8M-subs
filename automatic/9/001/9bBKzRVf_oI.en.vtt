flavorful the story had not thought the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.229 
flavorful the story had not thought the
eye<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.140> heard<00:02:19.380> there<00:02:19.680> was<00:02:19.940> during<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
eye of heard there was during one of the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.650 
eye of heard there was during one of the
wars<00:02:21.269> some<00:02:22.170> soldiers<00:02:22.590> were<00:02:22.860> cooking<00:02:23.660> soybeans

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660

to<00:02:25.049> feed<00:02:25.230> their<00:02:25.500> horses<00:02:25.940> they're<00:02:26.940> making

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
to feed their horses they're making

so<00:02:30.420> i<00:02:30.720> guess<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.130> good

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so i guess it was like not a very good

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.860 
so i guess it was like not a very good
attack<00:02:32.579> because<00:02:32.820> they<00:02:32.940> had<00:02:33.060> time<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.480> pack<00:02:33.660> up

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
war they enjoyed reading it and it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.490 
war they enjoyed reading it and it
became<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.970> Japanese<00:03:09.630> soul<00:03:10.560> food<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.430> sorts<00:03:12.500> but

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
became a Japanese soul food of sorts but

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.039 
became a Japanese soul food of sorts but
maybe<00:03:14.040> even<00:03:14.700> many<00:03:15.030> Japanese<00:03:15.570> people<00:03:15.600> don't

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
maybe even many Japanese people don't

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.750 
maybe even many Japanese people don't
like<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.230> eat<00:03:16.380> not<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.549> though

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.980 

well<00:03:20.760> maybe<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:21.000> many<00:03:21.240> but<00:03:21.480> there's<00:03:21.720> quite<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
well maybe not many but there's quite a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.360 
well maybe not many but there's quite a
few<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.640> say<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.700> majority<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.300> them<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.840> but

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
few I say the majority of them can but

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.620 
few I say the majority of them can but
it's<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:26.550> uncommon<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.030> find<00:03:27.120> someone<00:03:27.569> who

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
it's not uncommon to find someone who

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.050 
it's not uncommon to find someone who
will<00:03:28.080> not<00:03:28.319> eat<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> Japanese

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
will not eat it it was a Japanese

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.190 
will not eat it it was a Japanese
descent<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> until<00:03:31.920> next<00:03:31.950> time
