end<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.009> mini<00:00:32.219> XL<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> quite<00:00:33.600> an

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
end two mini XL this is quite an

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
end two mini XL this is quite an
exceptional<00:00:34.260> case<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:35.130> designed<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
exceptional case we designed it with the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
exceptional case we designed it with the
same<00:00:35.940> mindset<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.899> developed<00:00:37.350> our

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
same mindset as when we developed our

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
same mindset as when we developed our
first<00:00:37.530> entry<00:00:37.980> case<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.670> endo<00:00:38.969> primo

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
first entry case the endo primo

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
first entry case the endo primo
basically<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.770> wanted<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> create<00:00:41.489> another

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
basically we wanted to create another

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
basically we wanted to create another
enthusiast<00:00:42.360> case<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> same

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
enthusiast case that has the same

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.310 
enthusiast case that has the same
extreme<00:00:43.920> cooling<00:00:44.250> possibilities<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> build

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
extreme cooling possibilities and build

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
extreme cooling possibilities and build
flexibility<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.670> new<00:00:47.789> user<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.239> any

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
flexibility and a new user for any

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.990 
flexibility and a new user for any
structure<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.550> wanted

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
structure but this time we also wanted

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
structure but this time we also wanted
to<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.449> those<00:00:51.629> features<00:00:51.840> into<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> smaller

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to put all those features into a smaller

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
to put all those features into a smaller
footprint<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> why<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.449> chose<00:00:54.660> for

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
footprint which is why we chose for

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.860 
footprint which is why we chose for
micro<00:00:55.350> ATX<00:00:55.469> design<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.719> end

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
micro ATX design as you can see the end

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
micro ATX design as you can see the end
of<00:00:58.020> mini<00:00:58.199> XL<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> lot<00:00:59.579> bigger<00:00:59.820> than<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of mini XL is a lot bigger than a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
of mini XL is a lot bigger than a
regular<00:01:00.329> micro<00:01:00.840> ATX<00:01:00.960> case<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> why<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
regular micro ATX case which is why the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
regular micro ATX case which is why the
real<00:01:02.820> enthusiasts<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
real enthusiasts are going to like it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.710 
real enthusiasts are going to like it
especially<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> possibilities<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.450> case

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
especially the possibilities this case

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800 
especially the possibilities this case
will<00:01:06.930> offer<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> exterior<00:01:09.180> has<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> similar

will offer the exterior has a similar

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
will offer the exterior has a similar
