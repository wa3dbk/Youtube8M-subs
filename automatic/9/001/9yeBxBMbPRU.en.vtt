00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.220
 today we are going to prepare the recipes 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.980
 inverted sugar that we will use to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.180
 the ice cream for it we're going to need 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.630
 150 ml of mineral water 350 grams of 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.210
 sugar an envelope of tartaric acid a 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.850
 about sodium bicarbonate which are the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.820
 white and purple envelopes sold in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.980
 market there is no more place where they sell it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 but where I find it easily is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.160
 in mercadona because nothing we are going to put the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 water to heat the fire let's leave 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 that breaks to boil will have to arrive 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.790
 at a temperature of 150 degrees 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.350
 sg the two envelopes of purple and white 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.980
 and when the river water starts 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.530
 we add the sugar 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.200
 and stir for the sugar to be 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.400
 dissolve completely 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.710
 when the sugar is dissolved 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.450
 completely and the and the water with the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.300
 sugar again start to start 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.410
 boil let's add the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.410
 the white envelope 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.070
 we keep stirring we keep integrating 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is the first aggregate envelope 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 and nothing stir on fire to be carried 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 well and once you are all fully 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.690
 linked is when we put out the fire and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.020
 we add the purple envelope that from the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 bicarbonate will ferment how are you 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.880
 seeing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 let's say well and when it's a bit 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 tempered we overturned it on a jar of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.090
 glass with lid we leave open 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.600
 until it's completely cold when 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.850
 already cold cover and keep it in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.450
 the fridge and that's our sugar 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.450
 invested
