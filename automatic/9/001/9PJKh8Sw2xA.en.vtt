00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.700 

in<00:00:21.730> this<00:00:22.730> autocad<00:00:23.270> tutorial<00:00:24.020> i<00:00:24.200> am<00:00:24.230> going<00:00:24.410> to

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
in this autocad tutorial i am going to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.330 
in this autocad tutorial i am going to
be<00:00:24.800> covering<00:00:25.340> how<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.290> mirror<00:00:27.290> command<00:00:27.710> works

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
be covering how the mirror command works

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.420 
be covering how the mirror command works
in<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:29.000> modify<00:00:29.570> panel<00:00:29.740> so<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.010> mirror

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
in the modify panel so the mirror

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.560 
in the modify panel so the mirror
command<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.180> very<00:00:33.020> simple<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.980> can<00:00:34.160> make

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
command is very simple and it can make

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930 
command is very simple and it can make
drive<00:00:35.570> symmetrical<00:00:36.290> things<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:37.850> know

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
drive symmetrical things and you know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.270 
drive symmetrical things and you know
that<00:00:38.120> type<00:00:38.270> of<00:00:38.300> thing<00:00:38.420> very<00:00:38.780> simple<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.010> here<00:00:40.250> i

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
that type of thing very simple so here i

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.430 
that type of thing very simple so here i
have<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.910> simple<00:00:41.300> shape<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:41.870> created

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
have this simple shape that we created

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.750 
have this simple shape that we created
using<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.360> rotate<00:00:44.360> tool<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.960> last<00:00:45.140> video

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
using the rotate tool in the last video

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.920 
using the rotate tool in the last video
and<00:00:46.760> i'm<00:00:46.820> going<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.120> show<00:00:47.269> how<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.510> make<00:00:47.600> a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
and i'm going to show how to make a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.009 
and i'm going to show how to make a
mirrored<00:00:48.500> copy<00:00:48.830> of<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.250> essentially<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.720> i

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
mirrored copy of it essentially so i

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.139 
mirrored copy of it essentially so i
will<00:00:51.440> come<00:00:51.620> up<00:00:51.769> here<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.790> modify<00:00:53.120> panel

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
will come up here to the modify panel

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.490 
will come up here to the modify panel
and<00:00:53.690> say<00:00:53.870> i<00:00:54.170> want<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:54.770> mirror<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:55.640> alright<00:00:56.630> so

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
and say i want to mirror this alright so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.440 
and say i want to mirror this alright so
just<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.370> everything<00:00:58.760> else<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.090> modify

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
just like everything else the modify

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.010 
just like everything else the modify
panel<00:00:59.480> i<00:01:00.020> need<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.620> select<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.100> objects<00:01:01.610> i

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
panel i need to select the objects i

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.410 
panel i need to select the objects i
could<00:01:03.020> come<00:01:03.440> in<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.890> individually<00:01:04.879> click

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
could come in and individually click

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.620 
could come in and individually click
those<00:01:05.780> or<00:01:06.140> if<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.220> remember<00:01:07.700> when<00:01:08.060> i<00:01:08.270> select

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
those or if you remember when i select

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.980 
those or if you remember when i select
something<00:01:09.020> i<00:01:09.259> could<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:09.830> larger<00:01:10.990> rectangle

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
something i could do a larger rectangle

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.900 
something i could do a larger rectangle
around<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.440> so<00:01:13.190> if<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.340> had<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.490> lot<00:01:13.640> of<00:01:13.670> little

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
around it so if you had a lot of little

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.540 
around it so if you had a lot of little
shapes<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.450> would<00:01:14.539> be<00:01:14.660> easier<00:01:15.369> once<00:01:16.369> i'm

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
shapes that would be easier once i'm

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.630 
shapes that would be easier once i'm
done<00:01:16.580> selecting<00:01:17.240> i<00:01:17.420> have<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.140> hit<00:01:18.259> enter<00:01:18.640> so

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
done selecting i have to hit enter so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.279 
done selecting i have to hit enter so
cad<00:01:20.240> knows<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:20.720> done<00:01:20.960> with<00:01:20.990> that

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
cad knows that I'm done with that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.550 
cad knows that I'm done with that
selection<00:01:21.619> process<00:01:22.390> now<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.810> will<00:01:24.080> be<00:01:24.200> asking

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
selection process now it will be asking

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.230 
selection process now it will be asking
me<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.979> first<00:01:25.250> point<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.850> mirror

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
me for the first point of the mirror

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.020 
me for the first point of the mirror
line<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.320> would<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.549> mirror

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
line so I would like this to mirror

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.149 
line so I would like this to mirror
vertically<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.170> at<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:30.740> point<00:01:30.950> I'll<00:01:31.130> just

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
vertically and at this point I'll just

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.120 
vertically and at this point I'll just
let<00:01:31.400> them<00:01:31.520> butt<00:01:31.790> up<00:01:32.000> against<00:01:32.510> this<00:01:32.869> edge<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.500> I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
let them butt up against this edge so I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.359 
let them butt up against this edge so I
can<00:01:34.430> just<00:01:34.700> pick<00:01:35.350> for<00:01:36.350> example<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.830> end<00:01:37.100> point

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
can just pick for example this end point

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.940 
can just pick for example this end point
here<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:37.939> now<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:38.659> says<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.869> second<00:01:39.590> point<00:01:39.830> of

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
here and now it says the second point of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.340 
here and now it says the second point of
the<00:01:40.009> mirror<00:01:40.310> line<00:01:40.580> so<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.600> could<00:01:41.900> come<00:01:42.110> up<00:01:42.140> to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the mirror line so I could come up to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.960 
the mirror line so I could come up to
the<00:01:42.439> midpoint<00:01:42.650> or<00:01:43.159> up<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:43.700> doesn't

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the midpoint or up here it doesn't

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.140 
the midpoint or up here it doesn't
really<00:01:44.060> matter<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:44.840> when<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:44.990> click<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.970> will

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
really matter so when I click it will

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.789 
really matter so when I click it will
initially<00:01:47.600> disappear<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.320> sometimes<00:01:48.680> it

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
initially disappear and sometimes it

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.630 
initially disappear and sometimes it
makes<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.009> feel<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.460> did<00:01:49.610> something

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
makes you feel like you did something

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.450 
makes you feel like you did something
wrong<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.780> didn't<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.950> cat<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.369> doing

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
wrong but you didn't what cat is doing

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950 
wrong but you didn't what cat is doing
is<00:01:52.670> asking<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> question<00:01:53.360> down<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:53.900> the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
is asking you a question down in the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.870 
is asking you a question down in the
command<00:01:54.290> line<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:54.950> asking<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.490> erase

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
command line it's asking you to erase

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.780 
command line it's asking you to erase
the<00:01:56.060> source<00:01:56.270> objects<00:01:56.720> yes<00:01:56.990> or<00:01:57.170> no<00:01:57.369> so<00:01:58.369> if<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.520> say

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
the source objects yes or no so if I say

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.030 
the source objects yes or no so if I say
yes<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.450> will<00:01:59.540> just<00:01:59.930> be<00:02:00.049> left<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.680> reverse

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
yes I will just be left with the reverse

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.770 
yes I will just be left with the reverse
copy<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:01.939> original<00:02:02.450> one<00:02:02.630> will

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
copy and this original one will

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.679 
copy and this original one will
disappear<00:02:03.409> it's<00:02:04.220> defaulting<00:02:04.820> at<00:02:05.000> no<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.540> if<00:02:05.630> I

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
disappear it's defaulting at no so if I

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.710 
disappear it's defaulting at no so if I
just<00:02:05.899> hit<00:02:06.049> enter<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.799> will<00:02:06.829> have<00:02:07.670> both<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.690> I

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
just hit enter I will have both so I

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.920 
just hit enter I will have both so I
have<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:09.350> copy<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.799> original<00:02:13.930> so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
have this copy and then the original so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.740 
have this copy and then the original so
to<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.250> again<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.299> slightly<00:02:17.450> different

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
to do that again in a slightly different

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.670 
to do that again in a slightly different
way<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.890> will<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.370> undo<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.110> ctrl<00:02:21.110> z<00:02:21.380> twice

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
way I will just undo that ctrl z twice

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.780 
way I will just undo that ctrl z twice
and<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:24.320> time<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.769> will<00:02:24.950> do<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> little<00:02:25.519> bit<00:02:25.700> of

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and this time I will do a little bit of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.630 
and this time I will do a little bit of
a<00:02:25.880> space<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.540> between<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.340> use<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
a space in between so I can use the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.820 
a space in between so I can use the
mirror<00:02:28.940> command<00:02:29.150> again<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.379> will<00:02:30.560> select

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
mirror command again and I will select

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.520 
mirror command again and I will select
my<00:02:31.430> square<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.390> my<00:02:32.569> triangle

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
my square in my triangle

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.130 
my square in my triangle
and<00:02:33.650> hit<00:02:33.770> enter<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:35.000> maybe<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.510> time<00:02:35.569> I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
and hit enter but maybe this time I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.230 
and hit enter but maybe this time I
actually<00:02:36.350> don't<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.860> butted<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.459> against

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
actually don't want it butted up against

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.270 
actually don't want it butted up against
the<00:02:38.360> back<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.440> want<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.709> do<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.920> create<00:02:40.250> a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
the back what I want to do is create a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.170 
the back what I want to do is create a
space<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:41.000> between<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.310> use<00:02:43.430> my<00:02:43.459> object

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
space in between so I can use my object

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.920 
space in between so I can use my object
snap<00:02:44.480> tracking<00:02:45.100> okay<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.610> hover<00:02:47.209> over<00:02:47.750> this

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
snap tracking okay I can hover over this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.270 
snap tracking okay I can hover over this
point<00:02:48.319> but<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.280> click<00:02:50.560> pull<00:02:51.560> my<00:02:51.709> mouse<00:02:51.890> off<00:02:52.130> to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
point but not click pull my mouse off to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.120 
point but not click pull my mouse off to
the<00:02:52.400> right<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.850> say<00:02:53.720> what<00:02:54.380> distance<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.069> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
the right and say what distance do I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.309 
the right and say what distance do I
want<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.600> because<00:02:56.989> it's<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
want this to be now because it's a

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.380 
want this to be now because it's a
mirror<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.010> will<00:02:58.130> double<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.000> if<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.150> say

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
mirror it will double it so if I say

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.390 
mirror it will double it so if I say
three<00:02:59.720> inches<00:03:00.020> here<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.500> will<00:03:00.590> create<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.890> six

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
three inches here it will create a six

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.120 
three inches here it will create a six
inch<00:03:01.640> gap<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.420> example<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.440> will<00:03:03.620> type<00:03:03.860> in

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
inch gap for example so I will type in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.960 
inch gap for example so I will type in
three<00:03:04.730> enter<00:03:05.920> okay<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.489> first<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:07.850> kind

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
three enter okay and at first it's kind

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.340 
three enter okay and at first it's kind
of<00:03:08.000> wanting<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.300> flip<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.690> down<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.260> that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
of wanting to flip that down and that

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.890 
of wanting to flip that down and that
seems<00:03:09.620> wrong<00:03:10.160> but<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.970> do<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:11.269> pull<00:03:11.720> my

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
seems wrong but I can do is just pull my

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.840 
seems wrong but I can do is just pull my
line<00:03:12.140> up<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.860> see<00:03:13.130> how<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.519> three

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
line up and you see how it's three

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.630 
line up and you see how it's three
inches<00:03:14.090> from<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.959> point<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:16.190> pull<00:03:16.459> my

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
inches from that point so I just pull my

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.780 
inches from that point so I just pull my
mouse<00:03:16.820> up<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.269> click<00:03:18.160> then<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.250> will<00:03:19.340> ask<00:03:19.519> if<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
mouse up and click then it will ask if I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.190 
mouse up and click then it will ask if I
want<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.060> erase<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:20.450> source<00:03:20.690> object<00:03:21.080> or<00:03:21.170> not

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
want to erase that source object or not

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.490 
want to erase that source object or not
I'll<00:03:21.530> say<00:03:21.769> no<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.850> hit<00:03:23.000> enter<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.600> now

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
I'll say no so I just hit enter and now

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.059 
I'll say no so I just hit enter and now
I<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.950> an<00:03:25.220> exact<00:03:25.730> mirrored<00:03:26.420> copy<00:03:26.720> six<00:03:27.709> inches

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
I have an exact mirrored copy six inches

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.190 
I have an exact mirrored copy six inches
away<00:03:28.190> from<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.519> original<00:03:28.790> okay<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.019> draw

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
away from the original okay so if I draw

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.280 
away from the original okay so if I draw
a<00:03:30.230> line<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.709> there<00:03:30.920> from<00:03:31.489> here<00:03:32.030> out<00:03:32.290> three

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
a line in there from here out three

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.860 
a line in there from here out three
inches<00:03:33.709> you'll<00:03:34.459> see<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.850> there's<00:03:35.090> an<00:03:35.360> exact

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
inches you'll see that there's an exact

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.580 
inches you'll see that there's an exact
six<00:03:36.530> inch<00:03:36.830> gap<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.459> between<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.260> could<00:03:39.260> do<00:03:39.440> this

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
six inch gap in between I could do this

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
six inch gap in between I could do this
again<00:03:40.130> by<00:03:41.120> doing<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.540> mirror<00:03:42.430> selecting<00:03:43.430> all

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
again by doing a mirror selecting all

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.250 
again by doing a mirror selecting all
four<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.000> these<00:03:44.269> objects<00:03:44.950> enter<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:47.260> perhaps

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
four of these objects enter and perhaps

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.819 
four of these objects enter and perhaps
I<00:03:48.650> want<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:48.950> come<00:03:49.160> from<00:03:49.370> here<00:03:49.910> down<00:03:50.870> three

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
I want to come from here down three

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.720 
I want to come from here down three
inches<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:53.890> then<00:03:54.890> I'll<00:03:55.010> pull<00:03:55.250> my<00:03:55.430> line<00:03:55.700> out

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
inches and then I'll pull my line out

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.020 
inches and then I'll pull my line out
this<00:03:56.450> way<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.079> remember<00:03:57.799> that's<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.190> axis

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
this way and remember that's the axis

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.819 
this way and remember that's the axis
that<00:03:59.150> I'm<00:03:59.299> creating<00:03:59.660> for<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.140> mirror<00:04:00.410> line<00:04:00.590> so

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
that I'm creating for the mirror line so

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.440 
that I'm creating for the mirror line so
it's<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:00.980> bit<00:04:01.130> like<00:04:01.160> folding<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.910> piece<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.269> paper

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
it's a bit like folding a piece of paper

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.020 
it's a bit like folding a piece of paper
in<00:04:02.840> half<00:04:03.170> or<00:04:03.470> something<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.880> when<00:04:04.970> I

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
in half or something like that so when I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.310 
in half or something like that so when I
click<00:04:05.239> out<00:04:05.420> here<00:04:06.340> hit<00:04:07.340> enter<00:04:07.730> for<00:04:07.760> no<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:09.290> I

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
click out here hit enter for no now I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.690 
click out here hit enter for no now I
have<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:10.160> symmetrical<00:04:11.859> mirrored<00:04:12.859> copy<00:04:13.160> both

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
have a symmetrical mirrored copy both

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.510 
have a symmetrical mirrored copy both
vertically<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.299> horizontally
