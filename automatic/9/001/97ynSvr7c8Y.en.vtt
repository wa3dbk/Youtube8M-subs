00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
and as you could probably imagine it

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.620

adds many more cows into Minecraft and

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
back it's a pretty funny looking so if

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.369 
back it's a pretty funny looking so if
you<00:00:54.969> kill<00:00:55.180> him<00:00:55.329> he's<00:00:55.780> not<00:00:55.930> going<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.109> be<00:00:56.230> like

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
you kill him he's not going to be like

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.959 
you kill him he's not going to be like
strong<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.769> try<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.370> kill<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:57.820> or<00:00:57.940> something

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
he just drops raw beef it's another way

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.279 
he just drops raw beef it's another way
to<00:00:59.980> get<00:01:00.100> some<00:01:00.309> more<00:01:00.460> food<00:01:00.699> and<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.989> kind<00:01:02.230> of

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
to get some more food and it kind of

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.250 
to get some more food and it kind of
adds<00:01:02.469> to<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.710> scenery<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.250> Minecraft<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.110> the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
adds to the scenery of Minecraft so the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.660 
adds to the scenery of Minecraft so the
next<00:01:05.440> one<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.710> little<00:01:05.800> bit<00:01:06.100> more<00:01:06.220> useful

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
next one is a little bit more useful

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.940 
next one is a little bit more useful
that<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> Apple<00:01:07.570> cow<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.110> as<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.830> could

teleport<00:02:58.750> that'd<00:02:58.990> be<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> nice<00:02:59.290> addition<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.920> it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
teleport that'd be a nice addition to it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
teleport that'd be a nice addition to it
I<00:03:00.370> mean<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> mod<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:00.940> pretty<00:03:01.180> simple<00:03:01.630> there

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
I mean the mod is pretty simple there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.570 
I mean the mod is pretty simple there
could<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.290> some<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.680> nice<00:03:02.860> fixes<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> make

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
could be some like nice fixes to make

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.820 
could be some like nice fixes to make
this<00:03:03.790> mod<00:03:03.970> really<00:03:04.000> good<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.380> think<00:03:05.680> he

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
this mod really good and I think he

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.890 
this mod really good and I think he
should<00:03:06.010> probably<00:03:06.430> be<00:03:06.880> able<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> teleport<00:03:07.480> or

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
should probably be able to teleport or

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.050 
should probably be able to teleport or
something<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.740> I'd<00:03:09.490> come<00:03:09.730> back<00:03:09.850> here

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
something like that I'd come back here

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300 
something like that I'd come back here

skydoesminecraft<00:05:42.099> cow<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.669> guess<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.090> creator

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
skydoesminecraft cow I guess the creator

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.510 
skydoesminecraft cow I guess the creator
was<00:05:43.479> a<00:05:43.539> big<00:05:43.750> fan<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.080> him<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.590> he<00:05:44.979> drops<00:05:45.220> gold

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
was a big fan of him and he drops gold

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.750 
was a big fan of him and he drops gold
probably<00:05:46.210> doesn't<00:05:46.690> really<00:05:46.900> surprise<00:05:47.169> you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
probably doesn't really surprise you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.740 
probably doesn't really surprise you
alright<00:05:48.760> so<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.030> is<00:05:49.150> him<00:05:49.270> right<00:05:49.300> here

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
alright so this is him right here

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.580 
alright so this is him right here
spawn<00:05:50.440> him<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:50.729> sky<00:05:51.729> the<00:05:51.789> cow<00:05:52.150> right<00:05:52.810> here<00:05:53.080> he's

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
spawn him in sky the cow right here he's

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.469 
spawn him in sky the cow right here he's
got<00:05:53.800> ten<00:05:54.010> held<00:05:54.220> he<00:05:54.340> doesn't<00:05:54.639> do<00:05:54.760> anything<00:05:55.210> but

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
got ten held he doesn't do anything but

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.029 
got ten held he doesn't do anything but
um<00:05:55.659> yeah<00:05:55.930> he<00:05:55.990> does<00:05:56.139> drop<00:05:56.320> gold<00:05:56.620> which<00:05:56.830> makes

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
um yeah he does drop gold which makes

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.420 
um yeah he does drop gold which makes
sense<00:05:57.280> so<00:05:57.520> another<00:05:57.820> way<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.030> get<00:05:58.330> gold<00:05:58.599> ingots

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
sense so another way to get gold ingots

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.219 
sense so another way to get gold ingots
the<00:06:00.430> next<00:06:00.699> one<00:06:00.820> is<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.150> cloud<00:06:01.479> cow<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:02.139> this

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
the next one is the cloud cow and this

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.469 
the next one is the cloud cow and this
one<00:06:02.440> drops<00:06:02.680> mushroom<00:06:03.070> soup<00:06:03.340> he<00:06:04.090> actually

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
one drops mushroom soup he actually

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.629 
one drops mushroom soup he actually
doesn't<00:06:04.690> do<00:06:04.930> anything<00:06:05.349> special<00:06:05.680> I'd<00:06:06.099> assumed
