00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:16.590 

see<00:04:07.569> how<00:04:07.720> that's<00:04:07.900> going<00:04:08.079> to<00:04:08.140> work<00:04:15.389> yeah<00:04:16.389> that's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
see how that's going to work yeah that's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.020 
see how that's going to work yeah that's
why<00:04:16.750> we<00:04:16.900> won't<00:04:17.079> right<00:04:17.259> there<00:04:20.910> turn<00:04:21.910> that

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
why we won't right there turn that

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.710 
why we won't right there turn that
upside<00:04:22.180> down<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.800> trip<00:04:25.680> put<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:26.889> there<00:04:27.190> and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
upside down the trip put it in there and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.320 
upside down the trip put it in there and
the<00:04:28.720> bees<00:04:29.580> we're<00:04:30.580> going<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.789> go<00:04:30.940> up<00:04:31.030> inside

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
the bees we're going to go up inside

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.330 
the bees we're going to go up inside
there<00:04:32.880> get<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> water<00:04:34.180> from<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.419> bottom<00:04:35.340> and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
there get the water from the bottom and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.100 
there get the water from the bottom and
plus<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.360> closes<00:04:37.750> off<00:04:37.900> them<00:04:39.660> kind<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.690> closes

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
plus it closes off them kind of closes

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.870 
plus it closes off them kind of closes
off<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.320> open<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:41.979> narrows<00:04:42.280> up<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.580> open<00:04:42.820> it

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
off the open and narrows up to open it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.340 
off the open and narrows up to open it
so<00:04:43.000> they've<00:04:43.150> only<00:04:43.300> got<00:04:43.479> that<00:04:43.660> much<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:44.020> go<00:04:44.139> into

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
so they've only got that much to go into

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.140 
so they've only got that much to go into
it's<00:04:45.130> going<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.340> be<00:04:45.400> kind<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.669> interesting<00:04:45.910> to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
it's going to be kind of interesting to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.510 
it's going to be kind of interesting to
