I<00:02:15.040> am<00:02:16.040> imagining<00:02:16.519> something<00:02:17.150> very<00:02:17.540> similar<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
I am imagining something very similar to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
I am imagining something very similar to
a<00:02:18.080> mobile<00:02:18.680> game<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:19.220> course<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> be

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
a mobile game of course is going to be

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.080 
a mobile game of course is going to be
some<00:02:20.420> bug's<00:02:20.600> expect<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.560> honestly<00:02:25.090> dream

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
some bug's expect that honestly dream

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.670 
some bug's expect that honestly dream
big<00:02:26.269> do<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.780> any<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.260> starting

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
big do you have like any like starting

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
big do you have like any like starting
ideas<00:02:27.980> start<00:02:28.459> small<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.810> get

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
ideas start small and you know you get

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.350 
ideas start small and you know you get
bigger<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:30.620> some<00:02:30.890> form<00:02:31.220> yeah<00:02:31.610> there's<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.209> lot

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
bigger in some form yeah there's a lot

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960 
bigger in some form yeah there's a lot
of<00:02:32.510> gameplay<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.140> happen<00:02:33.349> yeah<00:02:33.970> it's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of gameplay that can happen yeah it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.180 
of gameplay that can happen yeah it's
just<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.420> simple<00:02:35.569> platformer<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:37.010> have

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
just a simple platformer so we have

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.370 
just a simple platformer so we have
simple<00:02:37.640> art<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> programming<00:02:38.959> we<00:02:39.260> go

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
simple art and the programming we go

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.809 
simple art and the programming we go
pretty<00:02:39.680> simple<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.099> we<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.370> still<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.670> like

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
pretty simple but we can still have like

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.720 
pretty simple but we can still have like
a<00:02:40.849> big<00:02:41.269> mean<00:02:41.569> concept<00:02:42.170> behind<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.370> idea<00:02:43.640> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
a big mean concept behind it the idea I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.210 
a big mean concept behind it the idea I
had<00:02:43.940> was<00:02:44.390> you're<00:02:44.750> actually<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.709> sound<00:02:46.010> wave

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
had was you're actually a sound wave

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.820 
had was you're actually a sound wave
frequency<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.569> evil<00:02:47.870> thing<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> sound

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
frequency and the evil thing is a sound

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.920 
frequency and the evil thing is a sound
producer<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:49.910> trying<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.239> get<00:02:50.630> rid<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
producer that's trying to get rid of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.539 
producer that's trying to get rid of
that<00:02:51.049> frequency<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.950> enemies<00:02:52.220> kind<00:02:52.459> of

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
that frequency and the enemies kind of

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.090 
that frequency and the enemies kind of
become<00:02:52.820> like<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.299> typical<00:02:53.859> crappy<00:02:54.859> pop<00:02:57.100> you're

long<00:03:33.260> as<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.709> avoid<00:03:33.920> them<00:03:34.130> yeah<00:03:34.549> I

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
long as you like to avoid them yeah I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.819 
long as you like to avoid them yeah I
like<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.209> too<00:03:35.480> do<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.810> want<00:03:35.959> them<00:03:36.079> always<00:03:36.350> to

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
like that too do you want them always to

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.289 
like that too do you want them always to
shoot<00:03:37.010> at<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.549> want<00:03:37.730> them<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:37.910> only<00:03:38.060> shoot

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
shoot at you you want them to only shoot

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.970 
shoot at you you want them to only shoot
at<00:03:38.389> you<00:03:38.540> within<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.780> rain<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.709> could<00:03:39.859> probably

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
at you within a rain you could probably

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.410 
at you within a rain you could probably
have<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.700> bit<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.880> everything<00:03:41.090> like

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
have a little bit of everything like

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.180 
have a little bit of everything like
burying<00:03:41.810> enemy<00:03:42.079> types<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:42.769> as<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.040> hit

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
burying enemy types but as you hit

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.129 
burying enemy types but as you hit
enemies<00:03:43.609> are<00:03:43.790> colored<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.299> your<00:03:44.780> change<00:03:45.019> of

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
enemies are colored in your change of

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.340 
enemies are colored in your change of
color<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.150> turn<00:03:47.359> blue<00:03:47.569> you<00:03:47.959> run

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
color and so when you turn blue you run

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.569 
color and so when you turn blue you run
a<00:03:48.380> little<00:03:48.650> bit<00:03:48.739> slower<00:03:49.010> she<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.370> be<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> little

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
a little bit slower she can be a little

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.819 
a little bit slower she can be a little
more<00:03:49.730> accurate<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.569> bullet<00:03:51.019> hell<00:03:51.139> yeah

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
more accurate so a bullet hell yeah

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.280 
more accurate so a bullet hell yeah
a<00:03:51.859> bullet<00:03:52.430> hell<00:03:52.609> game<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:53.120> basically

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
a bullet hell game is basically

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.649 
a bullet hell game is basically
down<00:03:55.189> there's<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.700> bunch<00:03:55.879> of<00:03:55.969> bullets<00:03:56.269> shooting

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
down there's a bunch of bullets shooting

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.319 
down there's a bunch of bullets shooting
everywhere<00:03:57.290> your<00:03:57.530> goal<00:03:57.769> is<00:03:57.950> dodge<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.640> shoot

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
everywhere your goal is dodge and shoot

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.649 
everywhere your goal is dodge and shoot
back<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.620> we<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.920> top-down<00:04:04.489> 3d<00:04:04.879> evolving

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
back so we have top-down 3d evolving

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.809 
back so we have top-down 3d evolving
shooter<00:04:06.019> where<00:04:06.379> your<00:04:06.530> circle<00:04:07.099> and<00:04:07.340> there<00:04:07.760> are

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
shooter where your circle and there are

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.729 
shooter where your circle and there are
orphans<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.390> join<00:04:08.629> us<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.049> grant<00:04:09.200> abilities

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
orphans that join us and grant abilities

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.770 
orphans that join us and grant abilities
you<00:04:10.069> start<00:04:10.370> off<00:04:10.519> as<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> circle<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.329> find<00:04:11.599> these

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
you start off as a circle you find these

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.319 
you start off as a circle you find these
orphan<00:04:12.439> geometry<00:04:13.040> shapes<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.819> essentially

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
orphan geometry shapes you essentially

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.090 
orphan geometry shapes you essentially
absord<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.959> stronger<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.530> become<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.920> more

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
absord get stronger and become a more

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.620 
absord get stronger and become a more
complex<00:04:16.400> shape<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.970> they<00:04:17.090> help<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.479> by

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
complex shape and they help you by

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.390 
complex shape and they help you by
granting<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.079> an<00:04:18.199> ability<00:04:18.440> as<00:04:18.949> a<00:04:19.039> little

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
granting you an ability as a little

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.860 
granting you an ability as a little
progresses<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.090> just<00:04:20.269> gets<00:04:20.419> harder<00:04:20.750> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
progresses it just gets harder and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.290 
progresses it just gets harder and
harder<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.289> harder<00:04:21.530> well<00:04:22.100> obviously<00:04:22.699> John<00:04:23.030> is

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
harder and harder well obviously John is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.330 
harder and harder well obviously John is
going<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.570> be<00:04:23.750> bullet<00:04:24.410> hell<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.009> know<00:04:25.130> they're

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
going to be bullet hell you know they're

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.580 
going to be bullet hell you know they're
scrolling<00:04:25.789> down<00:04:26.360> from<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.169> you<00:04:27.229> start<00:04:27.440> at

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
scrolling down from it and you start at

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.080 
scrolling down from it and you start at
the<00:04:27.680> bottom<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.130> you're<00:04:28.280> moving<00:04:28.490> from<00:04:28.880> side

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the bottom and you're moving from side

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.180 
the bottom and you're moving from side
to<00:04:29.150> side<00:04:29.330> well<00:04:29.780> yeah<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.470> mean<00:04:30.530> they're<00:04:30.889> coming

to side well yeah I mean they're coming
towards<00:04:31.639> you<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.060> concept<00:04:32.509> that<00:04:32.539> my<00:04:32.720> team

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
towards you the concept that my team

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.710 
towards you the concept that my team
came<00:04:33.169> up<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:33.380> is<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.889> bullet<00:04:34.669> hell<00:04:34.940> game<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
came up with is a bullet hell game the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.689 
came up with is a bullet hell game the
character<00:04:36.440> per<00:04:36.979> se<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.759> wavelength<00:04:38.750> or<00:04:39.380> a

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
character per se is a wavelength or a

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.460 
character per se is a wavelength or a
frequency<00:04:40.699> every<00:04:41.300> movement<00:04:41.509> you<00:04:41.780> make<00:04:42.080> has<00:04:42.440> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
frequency every movement you make has to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.439 
frequency every movement you make has to
be<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:42.979> deep<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.699> music<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
be to the deep of the music and the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.930 
be to the deep of the music and the
player<00:04:44.720> itself<00:04:44.960> creates<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.130> melody<00:04:46.520> through

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
player itself creates the melody through

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.850 
player itself creates the melody through
all<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.240> actions<00:04:47.630> he's<00:04:47.840> making<00:04:48.169> every<00:04:48.830> shot

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
all the actions he's making every shot

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.430 
all the actions he's making every shot
you<00:04:49.370> make<00:04:49.580> all<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.539> power-ups<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.050> pick<00:04:51.259> up

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
you make all the power-ups you pick up

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.339 
you make all the power-ups you pick up
add<00:04:51.740> two<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.729> music<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.509> end<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.320> end

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
add two of the music and the end you end

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.560 
add two of the music and the end you end
up<00:04:54.530> making<00:04:54.710> some<00:04:55.099> really<00:04:55.430> cool<00:04:55.759> music<00:04:55.910> let's
