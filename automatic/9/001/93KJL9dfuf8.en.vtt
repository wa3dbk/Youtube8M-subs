00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.740
 Unfortunately the current European Cup path 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 bt 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.240
 turned out to be short in both league series 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 championship standings with 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.190
 Kazakhstan miner yellow-blue is not 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.010
 demonstrated due aggressiveness 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.320
 attacking purposefulness and probably 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.230
 in some moments did not make friends with 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.230
 later good luck anyway life on that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.199
 does not stop though coming in autumn 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.170
 and our team and and and loyal fans 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 will really miss something she 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.870
 now there is a lot of emptiness 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 voids including what we knew that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 the end of the summer all the fall of the beginning of the winter we 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.410
 we live in very tight graphics now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.680
 we even have our calendar visible when 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.469
 three games a month is very difficult for 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.270
 us because we are to some extent already 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 lost the coaching staff and such a schedule 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.329
 because they did not know how the work 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 with a tight schedule and now we have 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.539
 weekly cycles are a lot of time 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.850
 very much we have to 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 train and some measure 12 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.490
 suddenly now is enough time 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 we have a lot of nuances to work a lot 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.430
 theoretical classes to hold it for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 order to better our operating 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.040
 attack then to improve our 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.880
 action protection 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.400
 but I think that especially for young people 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 very useful when such cyclist 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.060
 play 1 week it certainly can not but 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 familiar to many 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.860
 we are professionals and whatever the situation 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.290
 by cons and we should 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.100
 despite this situation should 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.200
 remain professionals work still 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.150
 more work for us here as it will 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 long weekly cycle 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.390
 here fix our problems start our 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.820
 the game 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.830
 horn look no further case motivation 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.560
 Podolsky is a panic and depression is necessary 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.110
 But with more ipad six times and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.210
 to progress well, naturally a task 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
 for the championship no one shot they 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.410
 are present and or 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 need to perform end or first place 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 here's your frequent repetition to you 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.200
 principle, the workers all understand what is needed 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.110
 continue to live further work all work 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.900
 I think a good mode, well, conclusions conclusions 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 need to do of course it's all commands 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.820
 We made some conclusions about 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.630
 panties headquarters and all the players we will 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.670
 try to correct our situation but 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.980
 and much about not responding to at 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 to the extent that now here is based on the fact that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.690
 everyone understood what happened more solid 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.940
 more aggressive team more know 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.610
 so receptive what we say but 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.650
 I think that all the same it is possible and negative 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.299
 Something to find how clear that without 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.000
 European Cup but also some time 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.590
 positive can be worth it like this 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.210
 here's a little dip in all of this for 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.100
 in order to 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.400
 next season even with new forces and 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.010
 Moreover, this season this season more 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.720
 you stirrups to end we are not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 forget the fact that his miners 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.040
 little man but given the standings 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.540
 on what place read bt 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.050
 I think it will be interesting before 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.700
 suggest dividing the six soon 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.650
 I think it will be interesting and at the very least 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.020
 least the team will try to do everything 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.980
 so that this 8 was interesting copying 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.140
 for fans beta 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.720
 and our task is clear that victory in 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.480
 every match we are now going to the question to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.100
 then the next round accept the miner here 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.780
 this is for us 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.510
 match sting like that even because 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 that but a lot we lost points than 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.300
 beautiful russia 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.130
 I would not like that many times 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.990
 did you lose rocks miner be successful in by 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.110
 distances our task is all to do it what 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.660
 we waited every match after returning 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.260
 from karaganda yellow-blue got three 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.870
 the weekend 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.430
 and then in the mode of one-time workouts 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.360
 preparing for the first 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.680
 August at the match with the author 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.930
 recall that in the first round 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.400
 in meeting these rivals Borisov 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.250
 got the top 30 though all the swords scored after 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.640
 74 minutes and forget the result of the first 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.910
 match 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.290
 Boris still there was a removal 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.299
 the lion's share of the match we had having 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.430
 up one player more now 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.130
 a completely different match will be a different coach 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.800
 now it works on strips so 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.770
 any match is very difficult for us and will be 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.690
 I can say that there is a field of some kind 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.050
 such poor quality believe that on 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.800
 strips to him at least somewhere 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.560
 waves at least that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.470
 it is fast and accurate 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.900
 and I think that for so much already 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.030
 various trips and home matches but 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.710
 I do not think that all such states of the field 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.379
 has some leading role 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.539
 because class team experience allows 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.669
 on any field with any rival in this 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.169
 sure well I think you shouldn't pay 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.169
 attention to some external factors 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.470
 we must first look at 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.110
 yourself look at our game think about 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.300
 however successful to collect are true. 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.030
 can win try to show too 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.270
 quality game you are the main thing these factors 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.770
 all other principle is not possible for 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.669
 me every game is important and it 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.259
 independence after losing except 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.520
 andate and then there are winning streams 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.870
 each other and the game is important and no matter how 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.560
 can not look back 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.020
 whether it is a successful game this is not a successful game 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.599
 Forward to see new goals ie new ones 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.770
 the games are now as if they were not particularly watching 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.289
 for searching camembert i think that minsk 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.729
 Staff have a professional and fully in 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.889
 We've chest 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.770
 what and how what is your team 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.270
 naftan think that we are always ready for 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.800
 any event variant is 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.360
 and positional attack quick attack and 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.130
 positional defense ie class 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.219
 teams and we often say that 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.620
 we must be prepared for any situation 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.479
 ready to lead the way 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.430
 may be a situation that the play 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.250
 there are any variants of events I think that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.710
 cream is ready in the general balance of meetings 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.039
 swimming pools then for the greatest benefits 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.889
 in yellow and blue until November last year 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:21.469
 Nova Polochans have never won our 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.469
 team within national championships
