00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
this is all Lewis so we're going to take

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.630 
this is all Lewis so we're going to take
the<00:00:43.540> engine<00:00:43.720> out<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.379> one<00:00:44.650> we're<00:00:45.550> going

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
the engine out of this one we're going

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.810 
the engine out of this one we're going
to<00:00:45.730> retrofit<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.570> in<00:00:46.690> this<00:00:46.930> one<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.430> engine<00:00:54.730> on

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
to retrofit it in this one the engine on

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.610 
to retrofit it in this one the engine on
this<00:00:54.970> one<00:00:55.240> at<00:00:55.420> shot<00:00:55.720> doesn't<00:00:56.260> have<00:00:56.380> any

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
this one at shot doesn't have any

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.910 
this one at shot doesn't have any
compression<00:00:57.540> this<00:00:58.540> one<00:00:58.780> here<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.320> got<00:00:59.650> it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
compression this one here I got it

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.950 
compression this one here I got it
the<00:01:00.070> engine<00:01:00.430> wasn't<00:01:00.760> running<00:01:01.060> out<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.450> so

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
the engine wasn't running out of it so

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.540 
the engine wasn't running out of it so
we<00:01:02.079> took<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.380> we<00:01:02.410> sanded<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.010> points<00:01:03.370> because

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
we took and we sanded the points because

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.100 
we took and we sanded the points because
it<00:01:03.670> didn't<00:01:03.940> have<00:01:04.030> spark<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:04.750> cleaned

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
it didn't have spark and then I cleaned

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:20.940 
it didn't have spark and then I cleaned
the<00:01:05.229> carbs<00:01:05.649> so<00:01:06.130> now<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:06.340> got<00:01:06.580> this<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.119> running

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.919 

as<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.069> can<00:01:22.219> see<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.399> got<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:22.670> stuff<00:01:23.240> taken

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
as you can see I got some stuff taken

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.980 
as you can see I got some stuff taken
out<00:01:24.079> of<00:01:24.259> here<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.420> this<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.840> major

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
out of here and this is the major

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.660 
out of here and this is the major
problem<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.649> we<00:01:27.799> have<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.039> fix<00:01:28.249> if<00:01:28.490> this

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
problem that we have to fix if this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.789 
problem that we have to fix if this
snowmobile<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:32.689> steering<00:01:33.140> column<00:01:33.380> in

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
snowmobile this the steering column in

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.849 
snowmobile this the steering column in
it<00:01:33.829> it's<00:01:34.700> supposed<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.209> be<00:01:35.359> bolted<00:01:35.679> to<00:01:36.679> these

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
it it's supposed to be bolted to these

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.429 
it it's supposed to be bolted to these
two<00:01:37.099> bolts<00:01:37.459> right<00:01:37.520> here<00:01:37.700> which<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.810> was<00:01:38.959> before

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
two bolts right here which it was before

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
clip thing there that holds on that bolt

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.209 
clip thing there that holds on that bolt
all<00:01:59.000> but<00:01:59.629> that's<00:01:59.750> broken<00:02:00.289> off<00:02:00.409> I'm<00:02:00.799> not<00:02:00.890> sure

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
all but that's broken off I'm not sure

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.499

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.990 
what they did to this but you can see
the<00:02:02.810> steering<00:02:03.110> column<00:02:03.439> here<00:02:03.920> supposed<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.879> go

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the steering column here supposed to go

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.819 
the steering column here supposed to go
to<00:02:05.060> those<00:02:05.270> two<00:02:05.329> bolts<00:02:05.840> right<00:02:06.020> there<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:06.799> you

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
to those two bolts right there but you

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.210 
to those two bolts right there but you
can<00:02:06.979> see<00:02:07.129> it's<00:02:07.310> bent<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:08.450> bent<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:12.220> it's

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
can see it's bent it's bent out and it's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.039 
can see it's bent it's bent out and it's
also<00:02:13.640> bent<00:02:13.910> off<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> Center<00:02:14.720> because<00:02:14.900> it's

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
also bent off a Center because it's

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.830 
also bent off a Center because it's
supposed<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.470> line<00:02:15.680> up<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.099> here

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
supposed to line up right here

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.449 
supposed to line up right here
so<00:02:17.840> that's<00:02:18.290> pretty<00:02:18.530> well<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.739> only<00:02:19.160> thing<00:02:19.340> we

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
so that's pretty well the only thing we

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.629 
so that's pretty well the only thing we
have<00:02:19.579> to<00:02:19.609> fix<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:20.660> other<00:02:21.200> than<00:02:21.639> getting

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639 
have to fix on here other than getting

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.150 
have to fix on here other than getting
the<00:02:22.880> engine<00:02:23.200> retrofitted<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.920> only

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
the engine retrofitted in it the only

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.509 
the engine retrofitted in it the only
other<00:02:25.310> thing<00:02:25.609> is<00:02:25.790> down<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.299> on<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.569> track

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
other thing is down here on the track

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.030 
other thing is down here on the track
this<00:02:28.599> piece<00:02:29.599> here<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.319> is<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.799> track

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this piece here this is what the track

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.559 
this piece here this is what the track
will<00:02:31.250> run<00:02:31.430> along<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:31.970> doesn't<00:02:32.239> wear<00:02:32.359> out

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
will run along so it doesn't wear out

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.420 
will run along so it doesn't wear out
your<00:02:32.750> metal<00:02:33.139> here<00:02:33.380> it's<00:02:33.769> roaring<00:02:34.160> through

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
your metal here it's roaring through

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.280 
your metal here it's roaring through
right<00:02:34.700> behind<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:35.569> we<00:02:35.720> got<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.959> replace

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
right behind here so we got to replace

00:02:36.290 --> 00:03:13.520 
right behind here so we got to replace
that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
