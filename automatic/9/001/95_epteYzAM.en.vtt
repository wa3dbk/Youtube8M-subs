00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, good morning, have all of you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.200
 today we continue our anatomy course 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.090
 let's see the bone is mobile 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.990
 well as we know the hyoid bone is going to 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.150
 be located in the nasal cavity 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.080
 the description of this bone is 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.279
 irregular 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.600
 of irregular shape will be formed of 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.119
 more than anything of compact bones and 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 only in the apophysis crista galli va 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.080
 to have a little bit of tissue 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 characteristics of this bone is going to be 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 that will include a plaque that informs 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 in the crisis to gali and a plate 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.550
 perpendicular 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.120
 it will contain many if it is not like 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.070
 that we can see that they are going to 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.170
 carry if you are not is not ideal 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.170
 deadly air cells 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.320
 continuing we will go to the plate 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.140
 perpendicular of the molds 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.810
 it's a thin plate and it's going to be a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.580
 vertical projection 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 here you can see that it will be in 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.550
 the nasal cavity is this part 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 exactly 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.040
 will form the upper part of the septum 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.730
 nasal and will articulate with the volume 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.730
 the cartilage 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.480
 or nasal good continuing now let's 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.240
 the shell 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.640
 waves with flames in the middle 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.829
 is a projection is a projection that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.159
 it's going to look like a shell is going to be 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.659
 covered by a very thick mucus is 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.140
 a part of molds as we can 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.830
 observe and the function of this of this 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.330
 medium shell 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.990
 it will be increase the aerial surface 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.300
 of the nasal cavity to heat and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.840
 moisten the inhaled air 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.100
 okay 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.079
 now we will see the orbital plate of the ed 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.460
 moy of what is being this 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.550
 We can observe 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.380
 well as we can see is going to find 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.340
 in the middle part of the orbital cavity 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.810
 is a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.580
 it's a smooth thin wall that now yes 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.520
 that has been in the part that I have already 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.630
 said in the middle part 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.630
 it has truly changed 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.569
 will cover the cells this air of 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:39.439
 the women 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.439
 posterior and middle and half of molds 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 good and the part 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.040
 the middle wall more right of the cavity 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.090
 orbital will be formed by this plate 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.940
 with the frontal bone 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.910
 and for the tear bones and the part 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.220
 to the minor of the bone are today des also to 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.920
 this is going to be known as the plate 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.890
 for expertise for expertise 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.930
 now moving to what I had already 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.670
 commented on the aerial cells of the bone 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.010
 hyoids that are going to be thin pairs and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.550
 they will have will be covered 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.550
 mucous membrane 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:26.610
 they are going to be previous medias and 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.370
 later will be a part of the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.290
 bones of a part 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 of the paranasal sinuses 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.860
 something important that we must remember is 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.110
 that the moral air cells 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.710
 later will open towards the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.980
 channel 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.790
 towards the upper nasal medium but and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.240
 middle and previous parts are going to open 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.110
 to him 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.110
 half nasal 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.630
 the paranasal sinuses are going to include in 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.200
 the frontal the maxilla and the spaces are 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.450
 ideals 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.450
 the air cells roll my 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.160
 sorry air cells in overhead cells &amp; 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.350
 morals now move towards the plate 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.820
 I wrote forment is going to be called riddle 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.590
 and form because you will have multiple 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.169
 perforations as we can observe here 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.889
 good is a plate of bones that goes to 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.280
 have many foramina that we can 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.950
 that vain 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 for that reason we said will happen the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.000
 olfactory nerves 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.879
 in number one 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.389
 and finally we're going to have the crystal 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.760
 which is going to be a triangular projection 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.210
 superior to the plate transform as 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.210
 here I put it 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.530
 where is it going 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.530
 to join but let's insert 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.759
 brain as we can joke 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.759
 as we will see later 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.129
 good and that's all general more than 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.400
 saying 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.330
 and the western very well 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.139
 later I'll make a video more 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.139
 in depth on this bone
