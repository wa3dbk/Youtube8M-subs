00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
power efficient so maybe that means that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.540

there's<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.140> possibly<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.260> chance

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
there's going to be possibly a chance

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
there's going to be possibly a chance
that's<00:00:40.680> coming<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.910> about<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that's coming out if you think about it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
that's coming out if you think about it
because<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> ipod<00:00:43.050> nano<00:00:43.320> old<00:00:43.680> generations

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
because the ipod nano old generations

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.670 
because the ipod nano old generations
were<00:00:44.460> used<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.820> watch<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.480> Apple<00:00:45.809> added<00:00:45.960> watch

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
were used as watch and Apple added watch

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
were used as watch and Apple added watch
faces<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.789> redesign<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
faces to that but then they redesign the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
faces to that but then they redesign the
Nano<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.930> does<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.170> mean<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> new<00:00:49.559> watch<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Nano so does this mean a new watch is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.639 
Nano so does this mean a new watch is
coming<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.270> sure<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.260> definitely

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
coming we're not sure but definitely

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.350 
coming we're not sure but definitely
people<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:52.980> looking<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> wear<00:00:53.640> their<00:00:53.910> iPods

people are looking to wear their iPods

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
people are looking to wear their iPods
and<00:00:54.600> technology<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.680> watch<00:00:55.920> would

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and technology more so watch would

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
and technology more so watch would
definitely<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.699> feasible<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.930> sure<00:00:58.050> how

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
definitely be feasible I'm not sure how

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.560 
definitely be feasible I'm not sure how
much<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.469> would<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> watch<00:00:59.160> though

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
much I would do with a watch though

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
much I would do with a watch though
tablets<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.410> about<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> though

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tablets if you think about it though

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.579 
tablets if you think about it though
tablets<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.510> somewhere<00:01:03.930> nobody<00:01:04.140> thought<00:01:04.439> they

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
tablets or somewhere nobody thought they

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 
tablets or somewhere nobody thought they
were<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> use

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
were going to use them and and now I use

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
were going to use them and and now I use
one<00:01:06.299> pretty<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.750> everyone<00:01:07.110> has<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.740> uses

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
one pretty much everyone has one or uses

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
one pretty much everyone has one or uses
it<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> Apple<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> definitely<00:01:09.240> make<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it and Apple can definitely make the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
it and Apple can definitely make the
watch<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.260> awesome<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.220> what

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
watch so that would be awesome but what

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
watch so that would be awesome but what
I<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.930> wondering<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> watch

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I would be wondering about the watch

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
I would be wondering about the watch
would<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> doing<00:01:14.930> besides

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
would be what would it be doing besides

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.710 
would be what would it be doing besides
the<00:01:16.860> phone<00:01:17.280> besides<00:01:17.729> things<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.570> my

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the phone besides things that like my

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.420 
the phone besides things that like my
phone<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.470> we'll<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.400> about

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
phone could do we'll have to see about

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
phone could do we'll have to see about
that<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.240> hopefully<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.869> integrate<00:01:22.259> iOS

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that but hopefully they integrate iOS

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
that but hopefully they integrate iOS
iCloud<00:01:23.759> Siri<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> definitely<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.860> need<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
iCloud Siri but it definitely we need to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
iCloud Siri but it definitely we need to
be<00:01:26.189> standalone<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.780> interesting

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
be standalone so it will be interesting

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.770 
be standalone so it will be interesting
to<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.670> what<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.450> what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to see what they can do with it what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
to see what they can do with it what
will<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> different<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.009> what's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
will make it different is really what's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
will make it different is really what's
the<00:01:32.670> most<00:01:32.820> important<00:01:33.329> thing<00:01:33.390> again<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> can

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the most important thing again you can

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.330 
the most important thing again you can
see<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.860> would<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.280> like

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
see like what it would look like

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
see like what it would look like
possibly<00:01:35.880> through<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.329> mock-ups<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.049> i'm

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
possibly through these mock-ups that i'm

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
possibly through these mock-ups that i'm
showing<00:01:37.229> throughout<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> video<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.820> good

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
showing throughout the video and a good

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.190 
showing throughout the video and a good
price<00:01:39.360> point<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.750> definitely<00:01:40.110> be

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
price point would definitely be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
price point would definitely be
necessary<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.189> need<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> fill<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> gap

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
necessary it would need to fill the gap

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
necessary it would need to fill the gap
for<00:01:42.509> watch<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:43.200> well<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.619> other<00:01:43.860> electronic

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
for watch as well as other electronic

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.590 
for watch as well as other electronic
things<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> first

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
