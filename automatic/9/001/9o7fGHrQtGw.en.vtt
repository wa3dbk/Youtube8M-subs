00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 Tuscan cuisine and surroundings with Francesco 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.309
 ra.gi years 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.700
 good morning from marinella pedri and how 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 every Friday we meet 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.800
 on our table 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.400
 very imaginative imagine a table 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.779
 on the mixer but we imagine it 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.920
 meet we said our personal 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.379
 chef with the dish of the day of cooking 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.510
 tuscany and surroundings buongiorno francesco 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.489
 good morning marinella good morning all 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 nuisance then I know that for today you have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 prepared a simple recipe 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.309
 simple as easy ingredients easy 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 as a tasty preparation but tasty 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.219
 exact 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.910
 what it is about is a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.710
 appetizer is also one with a starter 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 very important nutrients because 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 contains many omega 3 fats 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.860
 essentials found in juve 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 in fact we talk about anchovies with le 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.369
 excellent onions recipe from banks are 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 we are very interested for two people 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 then we make 8 anchovies let's say below 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.310
 salt or even fresh spring onions 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 long a bunch of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.689
 olive oil and wine vinegar 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 red also what is enough so 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.150
 they are easy to find ingredients e 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.400
 cheap for a dish instead 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.830
 very tasty as we said as we should 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.229
 proceed for the preparation 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.840
 then we take the anchovies and they come 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.240
 fillet then clean the onions 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.549
 they are cut into very thin rounds 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 then put the anchovies in a jar 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.979
 we cover with sliced ​​cipollini 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.159
 spray with red vinegar and cover 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.689
 all with extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 we put a little bit of salt but little 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.070
 because they are under salt are the a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.530
 salt and if they are fresh we do not go 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.890
 to burn with salt let rest 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.619
 for half an hour and we serve them immediately 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.299
 even on a slice of toasted bread 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.390
 maybe with a little dario rubbed 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.490
 above which is an incredible thing 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.650
 I watch that they have just passed 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.580
 I am one and a half in the morning 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.840
 snack with a toasted crouton 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.390
 crouton of toasted bread with on top 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.810
 two onions so the anchovies there 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.569
 I would do 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.190
 but I say I tell you I would do it right 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.550
 because you made me water 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.310
 in the mouth , perhaps in another wine 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.620
 time not now the wine to pair with 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.890
 this dish then the wine and I would go up 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 Tuscan rosé kept in the fridge bandello 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.920
 fresh fries so we have these 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.320
 two contrasts that are the end of the world 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.090
 okay enough i'm going to get myself go to 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.920

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.890
