for<00:00:44.040> live<00:00:44.250> bait<00:00:45.890> now<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> construction<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.640> did

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
for live bait now the construction I did

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470 
for live bait now the construction I did
of<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.930> its<00:00:49.200> own<00:00:49.350> clip<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of this it has its own clip and I just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840 
of this it has its own clip and I just
dug<00:00:51.899> open<00:00:52.170> notch<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> lid<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.520> still

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
dug open notch here so the lid can still

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.799 
dug open notch here so the lid can still
go<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.350> fastened<00:00:56.010> tight<00:00:56.480> well<00:00:57.480> being

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
go down and fastened tight well being

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.150 
go down and fastened tight well being
hindered<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.030> by<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> clip<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:01.010> then<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
hindered by the by the clip there then I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.830 
hindered by the by the clip there then I
drilled<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> 3/8<00:01:03.030> hole

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
drilled a 3/8 hole

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.270 
drilled a 3/8 hole
I'll<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.530> number<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.010> under<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> rim

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
I'll just number there under the rim

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
I'll just number there under the rim
still<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.729> hinder<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> top<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:10.170> back

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
still will not hinder the top going back

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.719 
still will not hinder the top going back
on<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:12.060> put<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> hose<00:01:13.260> through<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
on just put the hose through it's in the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.789 
on just put the hose through it's in the
water

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
water

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.969 
water
and<00:01:17.180> let's<00:01:18.180> check<00:01:18.540> her<00:01:18.750> out

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.030 

works

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.620 

so<00:01:28.580> there<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.820> have<00:01:29.030> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so there you have it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.210 
so there you have it
one<00:01:31.229> live<00:01:31.920> bait<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:35.509> manufacturer's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
one live bait well the manufacturer's

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.210 
one live bait well the manufacturer's
says<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:41.430> unit<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:41.880> run<00:01:42.090> 24<00:01:42.630> hours

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
says that the the unit will run 24 hours

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.560 
says that the the unit will run 24 hours
on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.729> set<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.090> batteries<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:47.330> with<00:01:48.330> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on the set of batteries and with this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.340 
on the set of batteries and with this
unit<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> batteries<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:51.750> makes<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
unit and the batteries in it it makes it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.120 
unit and the batteries in it it makes it
pretty<00:01:52.590> lopsided<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.789> water<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
pretty lopsided so with the water in it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
pretty lopsided so with the water in it
which<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.310> basically<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.090> want<00:01:57.330> anyways
