00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.630 
we had those two chances there was a
penalty<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.290> course<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.040> when<00:03:43.280> storage

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
penalty and of course and when storage

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.040 
penalty and of course and when storage
could<00:03:43.850> publish<00:03:44.180> where<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.540> katene<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:44.989> know

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
could publish where the katene you know

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.830 
could publish where the katene you know
and<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.530> feel<00:03:45.830> if<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.130> got<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.489> fifth

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
and I do feel if we got the fifth

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.420 
and I do feel if we got the fifth
anything<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.350> was<00:03:48.770> possible<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.160> really

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
anything it was possible I really

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.770 
anything it was possible I really
thought<00:03:49.550> we<00:03:49.670> could<00:03:49.880> have<00:03:50.030> totally<00:03:50.330> lost<00:03:50.630> only

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
thought we could have totally lost only

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.449 
thought we could have totally lost only
one<00:03:50.959> before<00:03:51.260> even<00:03:51.410> on<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> half<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:51.860> feeling

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
one before even on the half that feeling

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.920 
one before even on the half that feeling
was<00:03:52.550> there<00:03:52.760> when<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.030> thought<00:03:53.270> if<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.780> can

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
was there when you thought if we can

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.540 
was there when you thought if we can
just<00:03:53.959> get<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.470> fourth<00:03:54.770> just<00:03:55.070> within<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.370> first

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
just get a fourth just within the first

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.100 
just get a fourth just within the first
10<00:03:55.820> minutes<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.330> could<00:03:56.540> really<00:03:56.989> be

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
10 minutes this could really be

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.560 
10 minutes this could really be
something<00:03:57.340> what<00:03:58.340> was<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.550> 51<00:03:58.940> minutes<00:03:59.209> yeah

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
something what was it 51 minutes yeah

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.180 
something what was it 51 minutes yeah
that<00:03:59.870> should<00:03:59.989> know<00:04:00.230> that<00:04:00.470> but<00:04:00.709> there<00:04:01.010> that's

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
that should know that but there that's

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.430 
that should know that but there that's
like<00:04:01.370> 50<00:04:01.670> 51<00:04:01.970> i<00:04:02.330> dial<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.630> know<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.020> up<00:04:03.230> that
