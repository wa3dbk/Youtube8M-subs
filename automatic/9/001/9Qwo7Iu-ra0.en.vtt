00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.420
 hello all can not wait 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.190
 m this regard spring if such a system 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.609
 we have 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.480
 some presentations could be promising 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 this is the man he was same thing for santos back 2 this saturday 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.189
 so my windshield for a few days to call took 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.190
 gold finance has he made known to the order so we can control see 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.380
 to the mayor 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.690
 and men and voting moments in the air duct 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.879
 the game begins to look like the moment of the facts against the textures 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.630
 are simplistic 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.860
 excluding loose items at the same time it draws on our shores 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.140
 the game is faithful 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 at the TV series 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.430
 then to know 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 frankly graphically and frankly it is super beautiful on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.510
 out of the ordinary a little more and the effects are much more beautiful 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.050
 so here we are in the house the death of his mother who is really 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.160
 well reproduced 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.380
 he does not close 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.039
 have the artistic fiber strong capital loss n 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.380
 so not the high level of dubbing everything seemed on track 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.070
 sambi blog pretty low 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.690
 to his eyes 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 matheou still practically 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.100
 margin even his household we are at the same point 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.320
 good so here we compare to a decent level top October 14 auxerre 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.820
 he has by month 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.790
 ryan 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.600
 though 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.570
 good blood of wood 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.870
 for them it's not trivial to ensure that it's not a bit of biting you 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.810
 have forgotten 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 chakib khelil 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370
 so the cutscenes are made 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 in cartoon that is to say as the TV series 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.360
 why part of the land 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 why not go further than I stop 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.800
 Guillaume 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.370
 in our heart it would take a spell on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.660
 you have a lot more the full veil 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.570
 on wii it is not available ps3 xbox360 version and we like 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.499
 much better especially the ps3 version containing 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.499
 an alternative suit 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.229
 woerth 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.299
 so she's not that little music that's starting 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.159
 we do just from beginning to end for his silence frankly a very 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.789
 good scenario 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.079
 really good script clever good brief all that really great 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.429
 for the moment this movement calls to a level or email 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:36.579
 nobody 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.199
 deltell this special 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.339
 special vigilantes we can see a level like this 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.309
 but 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.089
 the different animals 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 ap quÃ©bec 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.099
 the millions of cars like them 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.909
 at each end of the credits 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.119
 gentleman 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.970
 the other 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.139
 a sport too much playing higher 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.059
 m 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.129
 the rating 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.129
 6 hours 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 point man 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.009
 Oh yeah 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.150
 vote 1900 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.410
 I go out 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.559
 we will know this morning if suddenly 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.559
 the airlock match 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.669
 ap 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.569
 criticism from the top of the country 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.159
 but 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.479
 d 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.479
 p 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.209
 the most himself 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.739
 since 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.889
 8 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.879
 I lost 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.599
 it is done 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.219
 following a person 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.089
 speaking on the bus 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.089
 then there you have the chestnut draws tonight Mass 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.829
 a good hour 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.430
 a good little wink as we speak if you have the parody of this 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.900
 fault allows moment you will face the disseminates it that looks like 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.069
 nothing of all that 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.289
 you have 10 gigabit ports of gta san andreas this directly 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.870
 a parody of May the menilles' lawn at the North Pole 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.930
 a parody decides alone 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.150
 and ipad a parody of luxury 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.009
 eddy lord of the rings 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.590
 frankly parents level of ivory 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.010
 all the others that's less the employment pole the club that lost 6 kilos that 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.689
 it was less good 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.689
 here all these guys there you do not care the game starts with what 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.909
 lifetime level the game is between 10 and 15 hours of play 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.900
 the pitcher frankly from start to finish for too long 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 in any case for me mo5 fan of the sober style 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.429
 what he likes for the basement of his house but people but he does not like 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:11.059
 and if we are elected never know 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:12.430
 if it's a symbol 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.059
 what he has in the basement of an exit plus this game you can job 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:18.709
 well this is one of the best I suspect that was created the world 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.709
 will play the hard blow 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.520
 I was small 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.770
 with success so here in this level we end up in the game engine 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.129
 we think the games 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.629
 namely the genre scenario 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.759
 it's the only day can be 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.139
 these six people 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.960
 who cuts that will be made who are they conquered his gold stock 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.650
 ventura he cuts out who are in a video game 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.630
 it is advisable to drink 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.520
 to know who is whoever created this game all that you go to me 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.639
 It's really well made 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.530
 so happy 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.530
 the levels will appear marc bruning it's really great 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.919
 the whole world 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.960
 in front of Boston 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.339
 jeans etc 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.339
 but rarely 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.479
 on the line 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:18.550
 A lot of success 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.909
 at stake 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.909
 the country 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.759
 it was the episode 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.050
 he refused 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.050
 miami 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.729
 vincent follow 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.009
 so here are 16 16 these episodes where you go into the game 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.619
 we kinematics 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.779
 excellent 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.479
 m 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.449
 m 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.979
 Yes 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:07.940
 8 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.499
 d 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.499
 keep it clean 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:40.649
 when the young global producer 

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:42.119
 job creations 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.580
 it's really a fairy tale 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.199
 my project is this video you will have liked it's really the know-how 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.809
 these same adjuvants for women and six men 

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:52.689
 to the council
