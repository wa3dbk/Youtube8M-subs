00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
of the smartest quarterbacks in the game

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.500 
of the smartest quarterbacks in the game
how<00:02:03.200> much<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.010> position<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.880> cerebral

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
how much is that position a cerebral

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.969 
how much is that position a cerebral
position<00:02:06.049> where<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.290> have<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.530> have<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.680> smart

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
position where you have to have a smart

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.559 
position where you have to have a smart
kid<00:02:07.159> well<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:07.970> probably<00:02:08.269> the

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
kid well it is it's probably the

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.270 
kid well it is it's probably the
toughest<00:02:08.959> position<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.679> sport<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.250> play

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
toughest position and sport to play

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.789 
toughest position and sport to play
because<00:02:10.819> it<00:02:10.849> it's<00:02:11.629> obviously<00:02:12.080> demanding<00:02:12.650> from

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
because it it's obviously demanding from

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.619 
because it it's obviously demanding from
a<00:02:12.920> physical<00:02:13.310> standpoint<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.150> quarterbacks

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
a physical standpoint and quarterbacks

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.759 
a physical standpoint and quarterbacks
are<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.019> get<00:02:15.170> hit<00:02:15.379> they're<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
are going to get hit they're going to

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.100 
are going to get hit they're going to
they've<00:02:16.610> got<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.939> physical<00:02:17.330> demands<00:02:17.689> but<00:02:17.930> you

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
they've got the physical demands but you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.160 
they've got the physical demands but you
can't<00:02:18.379> play<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> game<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.430> can't

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
can't play the game if you can't

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.929 
can't play the game if you can't
understand<00:02:21.170> concepts<00:02:21.799> if<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.129> can't<00:02:22.430> make

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
understand concepts if you can't make

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.729 
understand concepts if you can't make
decisions<00:02:23.120> under<00:02:23.810> pressure<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.409> a<00:02:24.500> short

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
decisions under pressure and a short

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.740 
decisions under pressure and a short
period<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.129> time<00:02:25.189> and<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.700> lot<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.299> that<00:02:26.510> comes

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
period of time and a lot of that comes

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.780 
period of time and a lot of that comes
from<00:02:26.930> your<00:02:27.230> development<00:02:27.980> off<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.340> field<00:02:28.580> in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
from your development off the field in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.390 
from your development off the field in
the<00:02:28.879> film<00:02:29.120> room<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.659> conceptually<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:31.280> have

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the film room and conceptually you have

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.250 
the film room and conceptually you have
to<00:02:31.549> have<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.970> be<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> quick<00:02:32.390> thinker<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.989> quick

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
to have to be a quick thinker and quick

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.349 
to have to be a quick thinker and quick
decision<00:02:33.769> maker<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.249> so<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.909> all<00:02:35.060> ties<00:02:35.329> in

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
decision maker and so it all ties in

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.030 
decision maker and so it all ties in
I've<00:02:35.689> seen<00:02:35.900> guys<00:02:36.139> with<00:02:36.379> tremendous<00:02:36.650> physical

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
I've seen guys with tremendous physical

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
I've seen guys with tremendous physical
talents<00:02:37.879> that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
talents that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.750 
talents that
never<00:02:39.110> got<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.410> mentally<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.610> I've<00:02:40.730> seen

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
never got it mentally and then I've seen

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760 
never got it mentally and then I've seen
guys<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.360> were<00:02:41.630> lesser<00:02:42.020> talented<00:02:42.560> that

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
guys that were lesser talented that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.430 
guys that were lesser talented that
we're<00:02:43.580> great<00:02:43.820> decision<00:02:44.810> makers<00:02:45.200> and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
we're great decision makers and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.690 
we're great decision makers and
understood<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.040> big<00:02:46.220> picture<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.610> things

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
understood the big picture of things

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.930 
understood the big picture of things
that<00:02:47.060> end<00:02:47.210> up<00:02:47.270> becoming<00:02:47.480> good<00:02:47.870> quarterback<00:02:48.350> so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that end up becoming good quarterback so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.940 
that end up becoming good quarterback so
it's<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.150> much<00:02:50.390> mentally<00:02:50.930> mental<00:02:51.650> as<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.890> is

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it's as much mentally mental as it is

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's as much mentally mental as it is
the<00:02:52.370> physical<00:02:52.700> aspects<00:02:53.180> sometimes<00:02:53.840> even<00:02:54.140> more

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
the physical aspects sometimes even more

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320 
the physical aspects sometimes even more
so<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.980> Knights<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.370> had<00:02:55.490> big<00:02:55.700> success<00:02:56.150> out
