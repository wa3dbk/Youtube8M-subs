Boyle movies there are a lot of fast

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.249 
Boyle movies there are a lot of fast

for a while you know I'm not a big fan
of<00:02:03.210> fast<00:02:03.360> cutting<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:03.960> Danny<00:02:04.470> Boyle<00:02:04.800> knows

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
of fast cutting but Danny Boyle knows

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.160 
of fast cutting but Danny Boyle knows
how<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> use<00:02:05.789> fast<00:02:06.060> cutting<00:02:06.390> sometimes<00:02:06.929> it<00:02:07.050> can

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
how to use fast cutting sometimes it can

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
how to use fast cutting sometimes it can
be<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.560> excessive<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
be a little bit excessive but I think it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
be a little bit excessive but I think it
worked<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.820> well<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.630> frightened<00:02:10.200> me<00:02:10.350> all

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
worked very well it frightened me all

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
brain dead really slow things that can

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.410
