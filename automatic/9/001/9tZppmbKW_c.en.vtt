00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
levels in this game I'm not sure exactly

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.679 
levels in this game I'm not sure exactly
how<00:00:26.340> many<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> couple<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
how many but there's a couple of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.349 
how many but there's a couple of
different<00:00:27.930> lands<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:28.920> here

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
different lands as you can see here

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
different lands as you can see here
which<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.630> contain<00:00:31.080> probably<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.679> 50

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
which do contain probably about 50

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
which do contain probably about 50
levels<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.820> each<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.570> I'd<00:00:33.660> say<00:00:33.840> 100<00:00:34.590> plus

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
levels in each so I'd say 100 plus

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
levels in each so I'd say 100 plus
levels<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.399> game<00:00:35.489> let's<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.510> back<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
levels in this game let's go back to the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
levels in this game let's go back to the
main<00:00:36.930> menu<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> continue<00:00:38.070> our<00:00:38.250> game<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
main menu and continue our game and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.990 
main menu and continue our game and
bahala<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> game<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.010> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
bahala in with the game is to you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.049 
bahala in with the game is to you
basically<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.690> control<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:44.059> circle

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
basically you control this little circle

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
basically you control this little circle
I<00:00:45.390> guess<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> could<00:00:45.719> say<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.170> robot

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I guess you could say this little robot

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
I guess you could say this little robot
just<00:00:47.640> by<00:00:47.850> tilting<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> ipad<00:00:49.140> side<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.590> side<00:00:49.770> as

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just by tilting the ipad side to side as

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
just by tilting the ipad side to side as
you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.850> no<00:00:50.969> physical<00:00:51.239> buttons

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you can see there's no physical buttons

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.590 
you can see there's no physical buttons
on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.559> display<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.789> basically<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> only

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
on the display so basically the only

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
on the display so basically the only
controls<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.590> tilt<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> ipad<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.520> move

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
controls are you tilt the ipad to move

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.389 
controls are you tilt the ipad to move
the<00:00:57.000> object<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.500> basically<00:00:58.649> tap<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the object and you basically tap and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.060 
the object and you basically tap and
hold<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> ipad<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.390> jump<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.680> whole<00:01:01.829> name

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
hold the ipad to jump and the whole name

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
hold the ipad to jump and the whole name
of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> game<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> try<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.350> gap

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of the game is to try and get to the gap

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
of the game is to try and get to the gap
and<00:01:04.949> basically<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> basically

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and basically get out of the basically

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
and basically get out of the basically
get<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> trench<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.270> one's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
get out of the trench so this one's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.820 
get out of the trench so this one's
quite<00:01:09.780> hard<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.590> haven't<00:01:10.770> actually

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
quite hard I think I haven't actually

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.539 
quite hard I think I haven't actually
tried<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.580> yet<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.920> as<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
tried this one yet so as you can see I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.830 
tried this one yet so as you can see I
basically<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.330> try<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
basically just got to try and get up to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
basically just got to try and get up to
this<00:01:16.259> gap<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.540> jumping

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this gap here I can do this by jumping

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
this gap here I can do this by jumping
and<00:01:19.380> basically<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.790> little

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and basically there's some little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
and basically there's some little
obstacles<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.140> push<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.890> slide

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
obstacles as well you can push and slide

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
obstacles as well you can push and slide
which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> pretty<00:01:24.540> cool<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.680> thing<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.890> do

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
which is pretty cool so one thing I do

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.109 
which is pretty cool so one thing I do
like<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.490> application<00:01:27.030> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
like about this application is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
like about this application is
definitely<00:01:27.659> nothing<00:01:27.900> else<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
definitely nothing else like this in the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
definitely nothing else like this in the
app<00:01:29.040> store<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:29.820> original<00:01:30.270> idea

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
