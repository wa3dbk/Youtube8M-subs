you<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.180> see<00:01:40.210> I'm<00:01:40.420> wearing<00:01:40.570> my<00:01:40.780> parachute<00:01:41.170> and

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
you can see I'm wearing my parachute and

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.670 
you can see I'm wearing my parachute and
if<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.829> jump<00:01:42.130> off<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.579> hold<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.600> F<00:01:43.780> key<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.530> can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
if I jump off and hold the F key you can

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.950 
if I jump off and hold the F key you can
see<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.100> glide<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:45.820> I'm<00:01:46.000> also<00:01:46.240> able<00:01:46.600> to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
see that I glide and I'm also able to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.569 
see that I glide and I'm also able to
control<00:01:47.439> my<00:01:47.619> fault<00:01:47.920> which<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.189> something<00:01:48.399> that

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
control my fault which is something that

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.160 
control my fault which is something that
you<00:01:48.880> may<00:01:49.060> or<00:01:49.210> may<00:01:49.329> not<00:01:49.360> have<00:01:49.630> noticed<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.079> I

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
you may or may not have noticed that I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.440 
you may or may not have noticed that I
could<00:01:50.469> not<00:01:50.649> do<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> glider<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.640> could<00:01:52.210> not

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
could not do with the glider I could not

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.060 
could not do with the glider I could not
control<00:01:52.780> my<00:01:52.990> fall<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.500> find<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.860> more

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
control my fall so I find this more

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.110 
control my fall so I find this more
useful<00:01:54.399> than<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.729> glider<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.210> certain<00:01:55.540> phases

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
useful than the glider in certain phases

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.810 
useful than the glider in certain phases
but<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:56.900> also<00:01:57.170> useful<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.190> also<00:01:58.400> notice

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
but it's also useful now I also notice

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.400 
but it's also useful now I also notice
that<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.180> sprint<00:01:59.540> jump<00:01:59.750> while<00:02:00.080> holding

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
that if you sprint jump while holding

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.920 
that if you sprint jump while holding
the<00:02:00.590> action<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.550> sprint<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.300> lot<00:02:02.540> slower

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
the action you sprint a lot slower

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.690 
the action you sprint a lot slower
compared<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.040> glider<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.520> let's

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
compared to that of the glider so let's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.370 
compared to that of the glider so let's
cut<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:04.970> sprint<00:02:05.420> jumping<00:02:05.750> with<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.050> glider

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
cut to sprint jumping with the glider

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.260 
cut to sprint jumping with the glider
Here<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.070> am<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.280> my<00:02:07.520> glider<00:02:07.760> again<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
Here I am with my glider again and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.030 
Here I am with my glider again and
sprint<00:02:08.660> jumping<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.410> glider<00:02:09.710> well

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
sprint jumping with the glider well

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.470 
sprint jumping with the glider well
allow<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.550> glide<00:02:10.820> while<00:02:11.030> you're<00:02:11.270> jumping

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
allow you to glide while you're jumping

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.730 
allow you to glide while you're jumping
in<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.750> air<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:11.990> as<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.620> can

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
in the air and as you can see you can

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.200 
in the air and as you can see you can
travel<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.100> lot<00:02:13.280> more<00:02:13.460> quickly<00:02:13.730> using<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
travel a lot more quickly using the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.090 
travel a lot more quickly using the
glider<00:02:14.450> over<00:02:15.110> here<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.740> heelys

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
couple years ago you craft them with

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.090

could<00:02:26.870> not<00:02:27.170> figure<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:27.740> out<00:02:27.890> for<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.160> life

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
could not figure these out for the life

could not figure these out for the life
of<00:02:28.430> me<00:02:28.490> I'm<00:02:28.790> sprinting<00:02:29.150> while<00:02:29.420> holding<00:02:29.600> F<00:02:29.870> and

of me I'm sprinting while holding F and
all<00:02:30.950> i<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.640> nasty<00:02:32.150> jittery<00:02:32.510> effect

can see these item display cases are
four<00:03:06.320> blocks<00:03:06.590> high<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:07.130> in<00:03:07.310> theory<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.610> should

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
four blocks high so in theory I should

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.100 
four blocks high so in theory I should
be<00:03:07.940> able<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.180> jump<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:08.480> these<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.840> here<00:03:08.989> we<00:03:09.080> go

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
be able to jump in these so here we go

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.949 
be able to jump in these so here we go
and<00:03:09.500> as<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.340> see<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.670> am<00:03:10.730> able<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.510> jump<00:03:11.780> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
and as you can see I am able to jump a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.780 
and as you can see I am able to jump a
whole<00:03:12.350> six<00:03:12.620> blocks<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.400> also<00:03:13.459> jump

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
whole six blocks and I can also jump

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.340 
whole six blocks and I can also jump
very<00:03:14.090> far<00:03:14.360> forward<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:14.900> things<00:03:15.080> good<00:03:15.320> for

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
very far forward so things good for

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.100 
very far forward so things good for
traveling<00:03:15.890> over<00:03:16.160> areas<00:03:16.580> with<00:03:16.790> canyons<00:03:17.600> rifts

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
traveling over areas with canyons rifts

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.720 
traveling over areas with canyons rifts
that<00:03:18.170> sort<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.620> thing<00:03:18.680> right<00:03:19.310> here<00:03:19.340> are<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that sort of thing right here are the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.310 
that sort of thing right here are the
flippers<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.750> guess<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:21.110> are

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
flippers and as you can guess they are

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.020 
flippers and as you can guess they are
used<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.770> water<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.160> cover<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.459> with<00:03:22.580> six

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
used in the water to cover it with six

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.310 
used in the water to cover it with six
pieces<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.450> leather<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.720> two<00:03:23.930> sticks<00:03:24.170> and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
pieces of leather and two sticks and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.630 
pieces of leather and two sticks and
we'll<00:03:24.410> go<00:03:24.530> test<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:24.980> right<00:03:25.220> now<00:03:25.370> I'm

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
we'll go test this out right now I'm

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.850 
we'll go test this out right now I'm
here<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.209> going<00:03:26.630> for<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.959> nice<00:03:27.080> little<00:03:27.380> swim

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
here just going for a nice little swim

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.770 
here just going for a nice little swim
in<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.280> water<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.730> as<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.030> can<00:03:29.180> see<00:03:29.209> I'm<00:03:29.570> able

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
in the water and as you can see I'm able

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.690 
in the water and as you can see I'm able
to<00:03:29.989> travel<00:03:30.290> fairly<00:03:30.950> quickly<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.520> water

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
to travel fairly quickly in the water

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.880 
to travel fairly quickly in the water
compared<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.630> standard<00:03:33.560> vanilla

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
compared to that of standard vanilla

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.949 
compared to that of standard vanilla
manka<00:03:34.310> but<00:03:34.820> you'll<00:03:34.970> soon<00:03:35.270> see<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.780> when<00:03:35.930> I

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
manka but you'll soon see that when I

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.960 
manka but you'll soon see that when I
get<00:03:36.080> onto<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.560> land<00:03:36.770> I<00:03:36.950> cannot<00:03:37.340> travel<00:03:37.730> very

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
get onto the land I cannot travel very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.720 
get onto the land I cannot travel very
quickly<00:03:38.300> at<00:03:38.510> all<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.290> my<00:03:39.530> max<00:03:39.800> speed

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
quickly at all and this is my max speed

while you are walking on land it's also

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.690 
while you are walking on land it's also
not<00:03:47.090> very<00:03:47.360> stylish<00:03:48.260> either<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:49.459> here<00:03:49.610> is

it only sends me this inside so it's not

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.050 
it only sends me this inside so it's not
very<00:04:04.900> effective<00:04:05.170> I'm<00:04:05.830> not<00:04:06.040> very<00:04:06.250> good<00:04:06.340> all

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
right so say if I wanted to reach this

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.000 
right so say if I wanted to reach this
chest<00:04:10.480> right<00:04:10.750> here<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.770> right-click

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
chest right here I have to right-click

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.699 
chest right here I have to right-click
the<00:04:12.220> block<00:04:12.580> above<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.330> then<00:04:14.140> fall<00:04:14.440> onto

the block above it and then fall onto

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.470 
the block above it and then fall onto
the<00:04:15.069> chest<00:04:15.250> below<00:04:15.640> so<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.060> isn't<00:04:16.329> very

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
more coal it uses up so this is a fairly

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.690 
more coal it uses up so this is a fairly

efficient armor and you shouldn't have

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.279 
efficient armor and you shouldn't have
to<00:05:30.820> worry<00:05:31.090> about<00:05:31.270> running<00:05:31.570> out<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.810> field<00:05:32.080> but

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
to worry about running out of field but

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.779 
to worry about running out of field but
in<00:05:32.410> this<00:05:32.530> case<00:05:32.740> carry<00:05:33.100> some<00:05:33.310> coal<00:05:33.460> with<00:05:33.640> you

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
in this case carry some coal with you

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.430 
in this case carry some coal with you
anyway<00:05:34.150> just<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.510> case<00:05:34.570> it's<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.990> good<00:05:35.169> form<00:05:35.380> of
