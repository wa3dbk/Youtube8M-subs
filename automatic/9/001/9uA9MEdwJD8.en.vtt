00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello to all today I bring you an equal day 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.879
 decorate your things for school and I 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.719
 I'm going to show my folder and 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.719
 my notebooks 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:28.359
 we will need glue magazines for 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.359
 form scissors books and a folder 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.130
 let's cut the things that we like 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.920
 now we are going to order them according to how we 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.920
 like to have them and we are going to stick them 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.699
 i 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.580
 and we only have to put the lining 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.060
 books very carefully and I put it 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.550
 by pieces because if you do not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 unhooked and could spoil it 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.740
 so I recommend you to put it for 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.490
 pieces and you are already yours 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 made folder 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 for our notebooks we need what 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.770
 same but instead of notepad folders 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.399
 it's like in the folders we're going to cut 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.130
 things that we like glue line the 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.640
 and good simply I leave you my designs 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.640
 so you can take ideas and do it 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.690
