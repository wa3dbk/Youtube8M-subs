close<00:00:13.530> match<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:15.269> nearly<00:00:15.990> let<00:00:16.289> them

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
close match because we nearly let them

close match because we nearly let them
sleep<00:00:16.740> over<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> fence<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.930> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
sleep over the fence and it was it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
sleep over the fence and it was it's
really<00:00:19.380> good<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.100> think<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.820> way

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
really good because I think we are way

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
really good because I think we are way
way<00:00:21.300> way<00:00:21.480> better<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.560> made<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.039> many

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
way way better that we made so many

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.120 
way way better that we made so many
mistakes<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:25.050> three<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.350> our<00:00:25.560> game<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
mistakes that just three in our game and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
mistakes that just three in our game and
we<00:00:26.189> couldn't<00:00:27.180> stick<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.720> our<00:00:27.750> game<00:00:27.990> plan<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we couldn't stick to our game plan and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
we couldn't stick to our game plan and
that's<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.039> must<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.640> many<00:00:29.789> rounds

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that's why we must have so many rounds

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.069 
that's why we must have so many rounds
you<00:00:30.269> know<00:00:30.480> losing<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.769> situations<00:00:32.550> or

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
you know losing two on one situations or

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
you know losing two on one situations or
defending<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.820> men<00:00:36.059> against

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
defending about with three men against

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.119 
defending about with three men against
four<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> we'd<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.430> fail<00:00:39.950> even<00:00:40.950> though

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
four and we'd all just fail even though

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.459 
four and we'd all just fail even though
we<00:00:41.309> practice<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.930> regular

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we practice that a lot with regular

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
we practice that a lot with regular
managed<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> close

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
managed to do that so it was a close

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.110 
managed to do that so it was a close
match<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.670> were<00:00:47.730> any

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
match but it's not because they were any

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.970 
match but it's not because they were any
good<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.379> made<00:00:49.680> some

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
good it was because we made some

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.840 
good it was because we made some
mistakes<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> guess<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:53.250> okay<00:00:53.550> we're

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
mistakes so I guess it's okay we're

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.080 
mistakes so I guess it's okay we're
gonna<00:00:53.969> work<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:55.309> yep<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> need<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
gonna work out yep I what you need to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.860 
gonna work out yep I what you need to
improve<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> team<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> final<00:00:59.870> maybe

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
improve as a team for the final maybe

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.609 
improve as a team for the final maybe
maybe<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
maybe just we have to take more to the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
maybe just we have to take more to the
game<00:01:04.769> plan<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.640> guess<00:01:05.750> it's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
game plan that's it I guess it's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.679 
game plan that's it I guess it's
concentrate<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.760> do<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.939> best<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
concentrate and do your best that's it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.680 
concentrate and do your best that's it
it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
it's

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's
neither<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.680> moment<00:01:12.040> how<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.550> are

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
neither of the moment how that you are

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.170 
neither of the moment how that you are
and<00:01:13.510> what<00:01:13.660> they<00:01:13.840> think<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:15.340> will<00:01:15.490> like<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.850> pay

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
and what they think we will like to pay

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.140 
and what they think we will like to pay
in<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.840> final<00:01:17.200> rock<00:01:17.380> faces<00:01:17.860> orbit<00:01:18.670> incentive

in the final rock faces orbit incentive

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.010 
in the final rock faces orbit incentive
again<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.580> don't<00:01:22.210> think<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.870> want
