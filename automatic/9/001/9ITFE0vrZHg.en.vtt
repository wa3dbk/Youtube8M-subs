00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.250
 [Music] 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.189
 the staff received some messages from 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.250
 people asking about breathing in the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.219
 How to Improve Your Breath 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 there is some method is not any tips 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.570
 Of course, it's very easy. 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.810
 simple just that you improve your 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.789
 physical conditioning 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 that's right there is no trick 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 our breathing rate is directly 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 related to our conditioning 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.399
 this means that the more trained 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 You have easier breathing. 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.000
 Of course I'm talking about that race. 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 slower it will run more light or 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.739
 moderate in logic that if you have a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.969
 stronger rhythm is not making logical shot 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 you will get breathless 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.149
 Incidentally this intention of this type of training 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.309
 huh 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 I will not put a session here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 questions and answers, what are we going to do? 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 to start with the first question is I 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 I must breathe through my nose and breathe through 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 mouth 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 Look it is possible for you to wait only 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.620
 You'll have to wait for the nose. 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.270
 nose and mouth 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.150
 There is no way you really have to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.409
 do what is most natural for you, right? 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.970
 do not try to do something different do not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.920
 there is right or wrong breathing in the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 Race, I swear to you that our 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.180
 body has the autonomy to be able to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.560
 Just where do you think about it, okay? 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 I must trace my relationship with the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 past 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.939
 you say space inspired spaces 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.920
 breathe 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.130
 do not do it, look if you have any 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.829
 biologist or veterinarian can please me 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 correct me but I fool the human being is 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.060
 the only one of the mammals that has the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 completely dissociated from the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.570
 when you are at a higher speed. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.979
 than a trot 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 so that was what I said before 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.799
 It has to be as natural as possible not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.509
 think of doing something different if you 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.070
 think you're running is 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.320
 thinking the breath is because some 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 something is wrong and one of such 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.119
 side of the side of the viaduct in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.409
 sao paulo and there in Portugal calls 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.479
 dumb ass 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.470
 good this side pain actually a warning 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.200
 of your body that something is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.130
 wrong in relation to breathing 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.630
 means that the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.000
 recovery is faster than the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 your body can handle year or related to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.229
 food is something you ate 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690
 too heavy before running you ate 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.550
 just before running and is related to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 intake and your body 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.080
 Complaining right in general you reduced 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.849
 the pace even stop for a few seconds 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.470
 already solves this problem has that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.629
 legend of the rue sheet nÃ© 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.519
 But you think you 're running started? 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.810
 so ordered or separate look for a 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.819
 rusting sheet you are making is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 slowing down they stop running 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.300
 to find the sheet of the month you do not think 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.489
 This pain will disappear. 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.660
 now it is related to food is 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.130
 better or leave this topic to 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.420
 then you'll have to wait for a 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.239
 little more to run 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 Okay, it's good you liked it. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.840
