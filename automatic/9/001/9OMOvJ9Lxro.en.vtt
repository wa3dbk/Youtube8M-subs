00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
of the patients who are offered these

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.320 
of the patients who are offered these
procedures<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.430> leave<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.940> patient

procedures we leave it to the patient

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.570 
procedures we leave it to the patient
again<00:02:14.600> we<00:02:15.140> tell<00:02:15.680> them<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> merits<00:02:16.370> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
again we tell them the merits and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.699 
again we tell them the merits and
demerits<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:17.150> our<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.530> three

procedures<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:19.580> probably<00:02:19.940> decide<00:02:20.300> on

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
procedures and then probably decide on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.440 
procedures and then probably decide on
what<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.110> procedure<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> what<00:02:22.880> what<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
what the procedure is what what is the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.000 
what the procedure is what what is the
procedure<00:02:23.810> which<00:02:24.019> would<00:02:24.200> be<00:02:24.320> best<00:02:24.500> suited<00:02:24.680> for
