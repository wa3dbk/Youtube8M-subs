00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.590
 because the simpsons are yellow 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.190
 have you ever wondered why 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.340
 all springfield is yellow 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.960
 or because its inhabitants have four 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.650
 fingers 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.010
 you know that only character has 5 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.590
 and that includes but the young man we tell you 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.590
 these and other curiosities 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.360
 was the creator of the series matt 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.809
 groening who ended up with questions 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 about the color of his creatures he was looking for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.000
 something different that drew attention to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.000
 the audience and go that yes it has done 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.870
 now that we know it was not a possible 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.179
 infarction this assumption that no more reason 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.420
 that the commercial was missing to know 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:05.530
 that I would give corresponded to one of the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 animators of the series 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.280
 four fingers and not five because being 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.980
 computer-animated cartoons 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.770
 it is much easier to equip it with pictures 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.900
 and try to deal with them so that they 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.900
 I saw a hand with five back perfect 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 just one character in the series lame 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 your five fingers god the reason is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 only and shows the difference between 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.910
 the man and god and his maximum 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.910
 approach to reality 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.990

 young fireman a mustache for example 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.729
 the reason is an adaptation as 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.729
 reliable possible for people 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.110
