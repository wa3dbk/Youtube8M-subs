00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.510
 well in fact the journalist who did 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.950
 this note suffered the curse is no longer 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.830
 with us 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.250
 and the truth is that I am demanding 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.779
 respected with this topic because it charges 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.419
 look and I explained it differently 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.829
 so Mr. Jhon this at this point I 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.899
 I could not get to the mind to understand 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.269
 because this picture causes that degree 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.339
 damn but if I have a theory in 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.099
 some time the original probably 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.200
 dragged a certain malefic power 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.300
 an important negative charge for 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.180
 who placed him in his house without 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.190
 However, today the collective power 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.740
 psychism of the mind that all 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 we have that information we have given a 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.210
 power to this box that has it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.880
 involuntarily from our 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.740
 beliefs but eye is a real power of 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.680
 there the power of prayer for example 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.780
 chain of people who pray in favor 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.760
 let's say someone is better and because 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.590
 they result from why we say they are channeled 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.810
 certain saints when invoked in 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.950
 quality of miracles so that you remove the 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.590
 illness, someone, etc., etc. 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.289
 this box has that same power 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.490
 in negative finally what is the great 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.079
 myth that is talked about why this 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 boy is crying is because 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:17.079
 it seems there are two things one that the painter 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.399
 successful that being that he did not have a 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.780
 career as a painter they say it's a 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.700
 pact with the devil this is already part of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.170
 the mythology and that he during his 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.869
 services as a soldier in the second 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.399
 world war the completely watching 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.020
 between the rubble of cities 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.109
 invaded true with italy and the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.819
 Germans saw children orphans 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.799
 murdered, what I was doing was opening 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.509
 the eyes but he does it crying because 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.099
 were children who lost their lives has been 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.470
 a portrait in his sketches and then in his 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.119
 house ended up painting it back to 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.229
 life and that's why that's why 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.000
 some people who have these 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.039
 pictures say that children are heard 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 cry let's say and that's why it provokes 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.819
 So much fuss but because I do not have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.619
 side is because the other legend says 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.869
 that this child cries not for the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.030
 suffering that distresses her and that is in 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.709
 the memory of the painting itself but that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.310
 there is a kind of being like a demon 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.829
 weigh where this is the eye this is the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.329
 eyelid this is like the part of the peak 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.489
 from above or mouth that is just swallowing 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.859
 the bottom part and it's devouring it 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.400
 in lateral form is like a kind of 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.069
 demon 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.140
 taken from a hp lovecraft novel 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.599
 true as these demons or gods 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.909
 primal underwater that would be 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.099
 devouring the little one and that obviously 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.140
 we understand that he despite the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.950
 tremendous details on the face 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.390
 it seems almost a picture of hyperrealism 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.459
 finally his clothes are tremendously 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.620
 abstract because it seems that it is a 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.359
 invitation to look for figures was spoken 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.549
 that there was like a goat's hoof 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.319
 with the goat representing the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.790
 demon many cultures and others 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.620
 symbologies that one can also 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.049
 find gold peak here that is 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.549
 rexach is on the left shoulder now 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.930
 that what happens, notice that they would be more 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.180
 far the first one we touch 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.739
 this topic here that is then published 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.299
 in several newspapers and other morning 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.609
 they also tried to do the same 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.430
 exercise a number of things happened 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.870
 weird problems with the lights are also 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.760
 they say the box I cry because 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.129
 they started dropping a few drops through 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.379
 from the water a glass moved and that's what 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.510
 we discovered five days later 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.489
 someone in the house like you who is 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.590
 now watching this program reviewing the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.470
 video realized that this box 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.000
 there was this felipe and I a glass moves 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100
 we try to imitate 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.560
 what could happen to happen 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.570
 that there was water and nothing slipped 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.580
 perhaps we could not prevent a glass 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.060
 will turn on its axis and then it 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.680
 will move the weird happen strange things 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.750
 I believe in the power of prayer so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.630
 I also believe in the power that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.060
 we give ourselves to this 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.590
 box and the recommendation and this is what 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.270
 is going to say any person is that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.760
 you fall apart if you have this box 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.320
 but it has no guard no no no no 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.380
 no reason say that the best thing is that 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.989
 Send it to burn it because you can see that 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.850
 is what this painting prevents many houses 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.620
 in chile when I say a lot at least 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.739
 I have five testimonies that I remember 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.630
 is that home have been burned except the 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.370
 picture be shepherd the living and the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.170
 picture they have touch to the march look 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.540
 the shore but the picture is 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.190
 completely intact I know that if 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.840
 they have a testimony and something that happened to him 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.860
 effectively to felipe around this 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.630
 picture is going to count absolutely 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.870
 all then this little pause 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.870
 commercial
