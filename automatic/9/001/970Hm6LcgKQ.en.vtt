has a ticking motion rather than a

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.859 
has a ticking motion rather than a
sweeping<00:01:40.159> motion<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:41.209> is<00:01:41.389> of<00:01:41.539> course<00:01:41.689> an

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
sweeping motion and that is of course an

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.779 
sweeping motion and that is of course an

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
a quartz movement now you should you

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.340 
a quartz movement now you should you
should<00:01:46.609> know<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:46.999> this<00:01:47.179> model<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.600> available

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
expensive option and you can also see

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.889 
expensive option and you can also see
the<00:01:54.950> back<00:01:55.189> here<00:01:55.639> now<00:01:55.939> if<00:01:56.209> you<00:01:56.270> were<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.630> have

shot of this watch performing in a

low-light scenario you can see that it's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.260 
low-light scenario you can see that it's
very<00:02:39.030> easy<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.450> read<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.650> Arabic<00:02:41.640> numerals<00:02:41.790> as

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
very easy to read the Arabic numerals as

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.270 
very easy to read the Arabic numerals as
well<00:02:42.480> as<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.050> hour<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.530> minute<00:02:43.860> hands<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.250> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
well as the hour and minute hands so I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.100 
well as the hour and minute hands so I
would<00:02:47.490> say<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.240> know<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.810> watch

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
would say that this you know this watch

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.590 
would say that this you know this watch
is<00:02:49.440> actually<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> bit<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.820> my<00:02:50.970> opinion<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.450> bit

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
is actually a bit in my opinion a bit

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.450 
is actually a bit in my opinion a bit
too<00:02:51.810> sober<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.650> almost<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> point

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
too sober you know almost to the point

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.490 
too sober you know almost to the point
of<00:02:53.550> being<00:02:53.760> plain<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.050> you're<00:02:55.200> someone

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
of being plain so if you're someone

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.570 
of being plain so if you're someone
that's<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:55.890> looking<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> make<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that's really looking to make a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.660 
that's really looking to make a
statement<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.600> watch<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.800> know<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.400> if

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
statement with a watch you know or if

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.490 
statement with a watch you know or if
you<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> bigger<00:03:00.210> wrist<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:01.020> might<00:03:01.260> want

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
you have a bigger wrist you might want

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.900 
you have a bigger wrist you might want
to<00:03:01.590> consider<00:03:01.920> something<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.700> little

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
to consider something that's a little

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.350 
to consider something that's a little
bit<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.390> substantial<00:03:04.130> but<00:03:05.130> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.240> have<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
bit more substantial but if you have a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.690
