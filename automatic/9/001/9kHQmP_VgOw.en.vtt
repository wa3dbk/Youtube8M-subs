of<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> different<00:02:35.250> age<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.640> has<00:02:35.730> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
of the different age so it has a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.670 
of the different age so it has a
different<00:02:36.120> flavor

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
different flavor

try to bring it all into one beer it's

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.479 
try to bring it all into one beer it's
about<00:02:46.519> thirty<00:02:46.849> percent<00:02:46.909> we<00:02:47.299> could<00:02:48.230> be

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
about thirty percent we could be

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.920 
about thirty percent we could be
convenient<00:02:50.260> having<00:02:51.260> fun<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.859> relation<00:02:52.930> it's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.420 
convenient having fun that relation it's
about<00:02:54.049> probably<00:02:54.530> about<00:02:54.680> sixty-five<00:02:55.219> percent

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

and wine almost met by way I mean there

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.340 
and wine almost met by way I mean there
was<00:04:19.760> something<00:04:20.000> about<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.299> was<00:04:20.600> unsliced

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
was something about it was unsliced

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.140 
was something about it was unsliced
poison<00:04:21.919> when<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.040> first<00:04:22.250> drunk<00:04:22.460> any<00:04:22.910> line<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
poison when I first drunk any line that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.000 
poison when I first drunk any line that
one<00:04:23.449> I<00:04:23.479> thought<00:04:23.720> me

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
one I thought me

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.890 
one I thought me
I<00:04:25.040> guess<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.910> muscular<00:04:26.120> nelson<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:26.630> when<00:04:26.810> it

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
I guess that muscular nelson so when it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.290 
I guess that muscular nelson so when it
comes<00:04:26.990> into<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.320> very<00:04:27.470> end<00:04:27.620> yeah<00:04:28.070> yeah<00:04:28.550> yeah

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
comes into the very end yeah yeah yeah

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.260 
comes into the very end yeah yeah yeah
and<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.570> really<00:04:29.750> adds<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:31.550> really<00:04:31.820> adds<00:04:32.000> just<00:04:32.120> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
and it really adds it really adds just a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.750 
and it really adds it really adds just a
different<00:04:32.660> kind<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:33.080> component<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.610> was

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
different kind of a component it it was

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.100 
different kind of a component it it was
named<00:04:35.000> for<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.300> nelson<00:04:35.600> region<00:04:35.870> where<00:04:35.990> it's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
named for the nelson region where it's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.260 
named for the nelson region where it's
grown<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:36.560> i<00:04:37.370> think<00:04:37.760> i<00:04:37.850> believe<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.180> original

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
grown but i think i believe the original

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270 
grown but i think i believe the original
in<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.750> min<00:04:38.900> hop<00:04:39.050> was<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:39.860> her<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.100> we<00:04:40.190> know

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
in a min hop was like her so we know

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.550 
in a min hop was like her so we know
blocks<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.790> that's<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.210> lot<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.570> very<00:04:42.230> similar

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
blocks and that's a lot of very similar

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.810 
blocks and that's a lot of very similar
homes<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.100> get<00:04:43.250> in<00:04:43.340> that

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
homes that we get in that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.880 
homes that we get in that
yeah<00:04:44.360> but<00:04:45.050> it's<00:04:46.420> just<00:04:47.420> an<00:04:47.510> amazing<00:04:47.890> complexity

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
yeah but it's just an amazing complexity

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.020 
yeah but it's just an amazing complexity
then<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.130> get<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.370> music<00:04:49.550> those<00:04:49.790> six

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
then you get the music those six

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.879 
then you get the music those six
different

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
different

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.980 
different
yeah<00:04:51.430> man<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:51.789> that's<00:04:51.909> a<00:04:52.090> lot<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.300> how<00:04:52.840> many

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
yeah man so that's a lot of how many

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.890 
yeah man so that's a lot of how many
hops<00:04:53.259> in<00:04:53.530> total<00:04:53.889> white<00:04:54.009> kilograms<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:55.150> believe

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
hops in total white kilograms I believe

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.059 
hops in total white kilograms I believe
it's<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.349> neighborhood<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.740> five

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
it's in the neighborhood of five

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.529 
it's in the neighborhood of five
kilograms<00:04:57.580> per<00:04:57.789> hectoliter<00:04:58.060> it's<00:04:58.449> a

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
kilograms per hectoliter it's a

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.499 
kilograms per hectoliter it's a
tremendous<00:04:59.259> amount<00:04:59.499> of<00:04:59.560> hops<00:04:59.740> we<00:05:00.009> had<00:05:00.099> some

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
tremendous amount of hops we had some

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.820 
tremendous amount of hops we had some
early<00:05:01.509> in<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.689> boil<00:05:01.870> late<00:05:02.169> in<00:05:02.319> the<00:05:02.379> boil<00:05:02.560> we

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
early in the boil late in the boil we

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.860 
early in the boil late in the boil we
had<00:05:02.949> some<00:05:03.189> in<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:04.060> in<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> whirlpool<00:05:04.599> which

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
had some in the in the whirlpool which

probably taste up yeah you certainly get
over<00:05:35.680> 75<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.490> 80<00:05:36.669> and<00:05:36.909> it<00:05:37.029> really<00:05:37.270> becomes

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
over 75 to 80 and it really becomes

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.219 
over 75 to 80 and it really becomes
animals<00:05:39.580> say<00:05:39.729> unpalatable<00:05:40.229> unrecognizable

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
animals say unpalatable unrecognizable

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.540 
animals say unpalatable unrecognizable
is<00:05:41.289> probably<00:05:41.529> the<00:05:41.620> way<00:05:41.710> your<00:05:42.009> body<00:05:42.219> can<00:05:42.460> get

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
is probably the way your body can get

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.369 
is probably the way your body can get
really<00:05:42.669> differentiate<00:05:43.210> between<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.779> beer<00:05:44.169> that

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
really differentiate between a beer that

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.890 
really differentiate between a beer that
would<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.650> ATP's<00:05:45.219> versus<00:05:45.789> 150<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.509> lose<00:05:46.659> yeah

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
would be ATP's versus 150 to lose yeah

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.600 
would be ATP's versus 150 to lose yeah
they're<00:05:47.349> just<00:05:47.500> at<00:05:47.889> that<00:05:47.919> point<00:05:48.279> it's<00:05:48.370> just<00:05:48.520> so

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
they're just at that point it's just so
