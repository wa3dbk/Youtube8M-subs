00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.560
 and this is my new video 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.370
 I got the whole post again 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 looks like this first I have it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.609
 of course, had been open before 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 not quite packed out because I have 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 thought 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 are you doing me an unboxing right now yes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.970
 to tell others what you have bought there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.710
 and now rolls with my displays 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 finally go on reasonable 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 after being here by mine 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.870
 I always say equipment here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 only yes I say 08 would have 15 things 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.690
 Diced Kramp and Kramp 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.039
 and and and now for the first time 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 Reasonably invested or carton is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.969
 very close is not always four returns 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.969
 but not always of advantage 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:08.630
 namely game capture hd by elgato yes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.490
 what is this the Finnish game records 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.580
 that's the packaging so that looks 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.740
 whole out 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.119
 Brand new should be 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 and oh nonsense I have one 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.750
 extinct pieces purchased 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.790
 however, it was brand new 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.180
 opened because exhibit me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.950
 could save a few euros there and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.950
 I did not think so 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.939
 we can open this up here and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.090
 then we have here that is too 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090
 beautiful 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.590
 a few scratches are present bothers 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.200
 I have not worked for so long 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 is warranty so i have too 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 not that one 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:00.000
 game capture hd we have here once 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.280
 a hdmi connection an av in connection 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.770
 So here we can do this, among other things 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.180
 three beautiful stetter from super nintendo and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.250
 thus connect an adapter 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.040
 then here we have hdmi out and usb like that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.739
 the part is so from the usb port 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.570
 powered by hdmi goes out 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.630
 Of course, from here directly to the TV 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.950
 hdmi is for example for the xbox the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 input and avm is definitely ps3 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 in order to naturally also older consoles 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.610
 wii ps2 or i wanted to say or via 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.260
 support ps2 or sony playstation 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.500
 which is twice as natural 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.880
 a great nintendo ds is sega mega 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.630
 drive and all that still 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.630
 can connect 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.239
 already the whole packaging material 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.500
 whole cable and they are so apparent 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.010
 still unused they were actually 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.870
 never used this is the usb cable 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.370
 here we connect to the usb 2.0 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.079
 port and here to the elgato to the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.130
 elgato in the gears forces as well 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.840
 always then we have here this is often 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.870
 this looks like playstation plug 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.340
 here which is exactly that that would have to be yes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.860
 his playstation 3 I would say 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:27.450
 then I have the fvw here in bella vhv 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.090
 plug then we have the cable 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.799
 HDMI cable 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.709
 So we do not need an extra hdmi cable 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.230
 I can buy directly right there 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 start and then we still have here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.410
 the beautiful place I just ever 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.240
 had addressed for super nintendo 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.720
 here is natural 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.640
 stereo audio two audio connections and 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.070
 then I would just say of the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:00.120
 colors should be red now he is united 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:02.760
 yellow always for the video for the video 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.580
 transferred in charge but since we are here 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.710
 already red and white and here still 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.940
 have a red and no yellow ones 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.190
 I go red and yes that 's it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:24.000
 already something here 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:25.980
 it is packing or another 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.700
 small instructions for ps 3 and 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.700
 playstation 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.490
 there industry again guidance for ps 3 and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.200
 playstation so wonderful that's how it looks 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.050
 that was it 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.930
 and that 's it, that's it 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.220
 unboxing noise from my ego makes 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.050
 she does not like she said she should once 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.310
 free function i have got warranty 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.310
 absolutely normal 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.470
 that was it now to my unboxing of 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.450
 my elgato i'm packing this now 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.300
 only make sense together again 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:11.770
 equal my second unboxing for a while 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.009
 gaming channel and yes what I am about it 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.619
 also purely for recording games 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.239
 films of gaming and yes just 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:21.959
 so that the quality is better as I said 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.519
 I once found you invested 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.989
 was synonymous time because this along with 

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:29.219
 all this diced together 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:31.119
 shit or other 15 euro goes there 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.559
 I just can not stand it anymore 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.419
 I have been standing for a long time now 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.610
 Look around which system I take and 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.089
 I do not care for the end now 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.789
 ok capture hd decided 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:46.029

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.069
