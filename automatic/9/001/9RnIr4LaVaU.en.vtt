ting<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:53.030> mass<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.450> school<00:01:53.720> was<00:01:54.170> compulsory<00:01:54.830> it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
ting as mass in school was compulsory it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.220 
ting as mass in school was compulsory it
got<00:01:55.670> really<00:01:56.030> annoying<00:01:56.390> because<00:01:56.690> some<00:01:57.050> of<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
got really annoying because some of the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.020 
got really annoying because some of the
stuff<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.620> just<00:01:57.680> didn't<00:01:58.130> understand<00:01:58.610> why<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.820> was

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
stuff I just didn't understand why I was

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.330 
stuff I just didn't understand why I was
learning<00:01:59.210> about<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.720> such<00:02:00.260> as<00:02:00.440> algebra<00:02:00.920> right

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
learning about it such as algebra right

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.560 
learning about it such as algebra right
so<00:02:01.700> we're<00:02:01.910> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.180> learning<00:02:02.360> about

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
so we're going to be learning about

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.990 
so we're going to be learning about
algebra<00:02:03.050> today<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:04.310> need<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.700> learn

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
algebra today you just need to learn

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.020 
algebra today you just need to learn
about<00:02:05.180> basics<00:02:05.960> ABCD<00:02:06.800> efg<00:02:06.970> eventually<00:02:07.970> you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
about basics ABCD efg eventually you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.280 
about basics ABCD efg eventually you
need<00:02:08.150> to<00:02:08.270> know<00:02:08.390> your<00:02:08.630> alphabet<00:02:09.010> so<00:02:10.010> what<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.290> 4x

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
need to know your alphabet so what is 4x

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.560 
need to know your alphabet so what is 4x
times<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.920> minus<00:02:13.160> root<00:02:13.580> cube<00:02:13.880> got<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> four

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
times the minus root cube got the four

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.900 
times the minus root cube got the four
times<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> four<00:02:15.350> air<00:02:15.590> times<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> X<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.730> mum

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
times the four air times the X your mum

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.090 
times the four air times the X your mum
you<00:02:17.300> are<00:02:17.540> never<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:18.170> understood<00:02:18.680> algebra

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
you are never really understood algebra

you are never really understood algebra
to<00:02:19.280> me<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.060> bunch<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.420> letters<00:02:20.600> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
to me is just a bunch of letters and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.140 
to me is just a bunch of letters and
numbers<00:02:21.110> mixed<00:02:21.740> together<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.820> confuse

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
numbers mixed together just to confuse

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.060 
numbers mixed together just to confuse
us<00:02:23.240> there's<00:02:23.960> no<00:02:24.050> real<00:02:24.260> point<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
us there's no real point of it and I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.100 
us there's no real point of it and I
cannot<00:02:25.460> see<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.850> being<00:02:26.090> used<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.570> everyday

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
cannot see it being used in everyday

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.810 
cannot see it being used in everyday
situations<00:02:27.380> probably<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.460> things<00:02:28.670> at

the<00:03:19.850> things<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.120> hate<00:03:20.330> but<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.600> find<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.080> funny<00:03:21.350> is

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
the things I hate but I find so funny is

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.320 
the things I hate but I find so funny is
when<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> teacher<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.190> wrong<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.090> prove

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
when a teacher is wrong and you prove

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.120 
when a teacher is wrong and you prove
them<00:03:23.510> wrong<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.930> then<00:03:24.440> they<00:03:24.470> tell<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.920> off

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
them wrong and then they tell you off

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.350 
them wrong and then they tell you off
for<00:03:25.430> proving<00:03:25.670> them<00:03:25.940> wrong

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
for proving them wrong

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.990 
for proving them wrong
so<00:03:26.510> obviously<00:03:26.960> one<00:03:27.260> times<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:28.040> equals<00:03:28.100> four

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
so obviously one times one equals four

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.300 
so obviously one times one equals four
so<00:03:29.300> you're<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.900> four<00:03:30.440> out<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> tension<00:03:31.190> for

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
so you're on four out of tension for

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.510 
so you're on four out of tension for
being<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.580> dark<00:03:31.820> head<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.530> it's<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:34.280> annoying

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
being a dark head and it's so annoying

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.890 
being a dark head and it's so annoying
