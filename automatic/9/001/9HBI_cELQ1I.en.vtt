it<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.450> like<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.840> when<00:04:00.170> when<00:04:00.530> referees<00:04:01.010> come<00:04:01.340> in

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
it I like it when when referees come in

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.670 
it I like it when when referees come in
and<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.940> they<00:04:02.420> look<00:04:02.569> at<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.319> health<00:04:03.560> of

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and and they look at the the health of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.530 
and and they look at the the health of
the<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.069> fighter<00:04:04.340> Valdez<00:04:04.970> really<00:04:05.330> wasn't

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
the the fighter Valdez really wasn't

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.690 
the the fighter Valdez really wasn't
putting<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.620> much<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.100> resistance

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
putting up that much of resistance

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.360 
putting up that much of resistance
against<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.810> fighter<00:04:09.050> dusty<00:04:09.590> Hernandez

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
against the fighter dusty Hernandez

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.809 
against the fighter dusty Hernandez
Harrison<00:04:11.290> certainly<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.319> brave<00:04:12.980> performance

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
Harrison certainly a brave performance

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.880 
Harrison certainly a brave performance
but<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.120> think<00:04:14.510> referee<00:04:14.840> Clancy<00:04:15.350> stepped<00:04:15.709> in

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
but I think referee Clancy stepped in

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.069 
but I think referee Clancy stepped in
just<00:04:16.220> in<00:04:16.430> time<00:04:16.459> before<00:04:17.299> he<00:04:17.600> was<00:04:17.630> going<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.930> take

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
just in time before he was going to take

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.020 
just in time before he was going to take
some<00:04:18.290> some<00:04:18.919> more<00:04:18.950> punishment<00:04:19.459> from<00:04:19.910> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
some some more punishment from the
