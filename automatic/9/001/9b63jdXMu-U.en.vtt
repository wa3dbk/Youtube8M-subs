during surgery these areas can be

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
during surgery these areas can be
monitored<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.080> real-time<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.860> kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.190> mapping

my<00:03:00.720> question<00:03:01.140> though<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:02.489> shouldn't<00:03:02.970> they

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
my question though is it shouldn't they

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.449 
my question though is it shouldn't they
know<00:03:03.390> which<00:03:03.870> bits<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> brain<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:05.070> operate

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
know which bits of the brain to operate

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.420 
know which bits of the brain to operate
on<00:03:05.880> which<00:03:06.120> bits<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.510> leave<00:03:06.660> alone<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.170> mean<00:03:08.160> it's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on which bits to leave alone I mean it's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.979 
on which bits to leave alone I mean it's
a<00:03:08.610> little<00:03:08.850> bit<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.120> comes<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.570> much<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.870> when

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
a little bit it comes to much as when

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.360

don't go in I mean that think maybe I
don't<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.769> bit<00:03:13.980> left<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.549> bit<00:03:14.700> they're<00:03:14.970> having

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000 
they just are doing it for fun
I<00:03:24.150> mean<00:03:24.690> what's<00:03:24.870> crazy<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.740> brain

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
I mean what's crazy is that the brain

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.320 
I mean what's crazy is that the brain
obviously<00:03:26.459> doesn't<00:03:26.790> isn't

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
obviously doesn't isn't

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750 
obviously doesn't isn't
doesn't<00:03:28.080> feel<00:03:28.200> pain<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.860> brain<00:03:29.100> tissue<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.640> of

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
doesn't feel pain the brain tissue in of

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.310 
doesn't feel pain the brain tissue in of
itself<00:03:30.060> doesn't<00:03:30.270> feel<00:03:30.480> pain<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.780> that's<00:03:31.170> when

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
itself doesn't feel pain so that's when

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.680 
itself doesn't feel pain so that's when
the<00:03:31.410> aney<00:03:31.620> statistics<00:03:32.250> steps<00:03:32.610> in<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.030> his<00:03:33.510> or

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
the aney statistics steps in and his or

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.480 
the aney statistics steps in and his or
her<00:03:33.840> job<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.320> absolutely<00:03:34.950> critical<00:03:35.340> in

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
her job is absolutely critical in

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.960 
her job is absolutely critical in
keeping<00:03:35.910> him<00:03:36.210> sufficiently<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.070> numb

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
keeping him sufficiently you know numb

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.270 
keeping him sufficiently you know numb
but<00:03:39.690> at<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> same<00:03:39.990> time<00:03:40.230> cognizant<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.070> mean

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
but at the same time cognizant I mean

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
but at the same time cognizant I mean
that's<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.700> tricky<00:03:42.000> but<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.360> do<00:03:42.510> believe<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
that's a tricky but I do believe that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.220 
that's a tricky but I do believe that
that<00:03:43.350> they<00:03:43.650> are<00:03:43.680> they're<00:03:44.460> trying<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.330> find<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that they are they're trying to find the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.980 
that they are they're trying to find the
exact<00:03:46.680> spots<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.120> they<00:03:48.270> need<00:03:48.480> they<00:03:48.810> need

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
exact spots and so they need they need

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.900 
exact spots and so they need they need
him<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> be<00:03:49.350> actively<00:03:49.830> doing<00:03:50.130> something<00:03:50.250> right

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
him to be actively doing something right

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.520 
him to be actively doing something right
so<00:03:51.120> guess<00:03:51.630> but<00:03:51.810> his<00:03:51.930> trial<00:03:52.170> isn't<00:03:52.350> that

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
so guess but his trial isn't that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.810 
so guess but his trial isn't that
troubling<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.100> supposedly<00:03:53.370> could<00:03:53.670> have

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
troubling to you supposedly could have

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.310 
troubling to you supposedly could have
been<00:03:53.940> amazingly<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.510> think<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.870> with<00:03:54.990> me<00:03:55.200> on

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
been amazingly I think it with me on

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.450 
been amazingly I think it with me on
that<00:03:55.440> table<00:03:55.680> I'd<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.040> screwed<00:03:56.250> because<00:03:56.310> I

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
that table I'd be screwed because I

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.770 
that table I'd be screwed because I
can't<00:03:56.670> play<00:03:56.760> musical<00:03:59.540> instrument<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.630> then

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
can't play musical instrument and then

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.910 
can't play musical instrument and then
suddenly<00:04:00.960> you<00:04:01.140> could<00:04:01.260> start<00:04:01.470> shredding<00:04:01.710> like

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
suddenly you could start shredding like

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.150 
suddenly you could start shredding like

that<00:04:05.160> would<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.490> cool<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.209> what<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.480> he<00:04:06.570> or

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
that would be cool but what if he or

that would be cool but what if he or
what<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:06.959> he<00:04:07.050> starts<00:04:07.350> playing<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.590> bum<00:04:07.800> note

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
what if he starts playing a bum note

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.130 
what if he starts playing a bum note
alright<00:04:08.970> we<00:04:09.209> shouldn't<00:04:09.480> touch<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.720> bit

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
alright we shouldn't touch that bit

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.660 
alright we shouldn't touch that bit

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
knows that now I always play that

knows that now I always play that
behavior<00:04:12.180> tricky<00:04:12.450> bit<00:04:12.600> for<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.840> yeah<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
behavior tricky bit for me yeah just a

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.699 
behavior tricky bit for me yeah just a
little<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.180> feels<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.600> bit<00:04:15.680> not<00:04:16.680> very

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
little it just feels a bit not very

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.740 
little it just feels a bit not very
scientific<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:18.030> him<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.420> but<00:04:18.600> I

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
scientific to get him to do that but I

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.000 
scientific to get him to do that but I
mean<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.170> nominal<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.650> do<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.859> not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
mean it's a nominal you can do is not

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.440 
mean it's a nominal you can do is not
the<00:04:20.190> only<00:04:20.430> yeah<00:04:20.609> he's<00:04:20.790> not<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.000> only<00:04:21.209> but<00:04:21.390> this

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
the only yeah he's not the only but this

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.580 
the only yeah he's not the only but this
isn't<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.750> first<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.080> this<00:04:22.260> happened

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
isn't the first time this happened

violinist also there's that the image he
also<00:04:27.900> they<00:04:28.230> did<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.470> similar<00:04:28.680> thing<00:04:28.980> with<00:04:29.130> him

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
also they did the similar thing with him

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.530 
also they did the similar thing with him
because<00:04:29.550> they<00:04:29.670> were<00:04:29.700> trying<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.090> actually<00:04:30.270> put

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
because they were trying to actually put

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.480 
because they were trying to actually put
an<00:04:30.630> implant<00:04:30.780> into<00:04:31.200> his<00:04:31.410> brain<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.370> this

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
an implant into his brain and on this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.890 
an implant into his brain and on this
particular<00:04:32.610> case<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:33.270> needed<00:04:33.480> him<00:04:33.750> to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
particular case and they needed him to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.740 
particular case and they needed him to
play<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.500> again<00:04:34.710> they<00:04:34.740> could<00:04:34.950> identify

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
play so they again they could identify

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.850 
play so they again they could identify
exactly<00:04:36.750> where<00:04:37.020> they<00:04:37.140> needed<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.470> put<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> it

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
exactly where they needed to put that it

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.740 
exactly where they needed to put that it
right<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.550> person<00:04:39.000> had<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> particular

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
right and this person had a particular

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.840 
right and this person had a particular
skill<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.680> if<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.460> was<00:04:41.610> slightly

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
skill that that if it was slightly

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.430 
skill that that if it was slightly
damaged<00:04:42.450> would<00:04:42.630> ruin<00:04:42.840> his<00:04:43.020> career

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
damaged would ruin his career

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.770 
damaged would ruin his career
correct<00:04:44.040> correct<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.060> mean<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.600> a
