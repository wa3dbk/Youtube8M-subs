hello everyone I have recently developed

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello everyone I have recently developed
a<00:00:03.689> software<00:00:04.259> which<00:00:04.529> allows<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.130> extract

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
a software which allows you to extract

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000 
a software which allows you to extract
the<00:00:05.850> animation<00:00:06.450> data<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.290> collado<00:00:07.620> file

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the animation data from a collado file

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.890 
the animation data from a collado file
which<00:00:08.370> usually<00:00:08.700> has<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> extension<00:00:09.660> in

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
which usually has the extension in

detaii
to<00:00:11.280> your<00:00:11.400> own<00:00:11.580> custom<00:00:12.000> formats<00:00:12.360> now<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.410> that

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
to your own custom formats now what that

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.700 
to your own custom formats now what that
implies<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.480> allows<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.870> ignore<00:00:16.170> only

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
implies is it allows you to ignore only

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.519 
implies is it allows you to ignore only
of<00:00:16.920> our<00:00:17.100> unnecessary<00:00:17.850> information<00:00:18.539> contained

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
of our unnecessary information contained

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
of our unnecessary information contained
in<00:00:19.740> escalada<00:00:20.250> file<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.050> another<00:00:23.210> great

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
in escalada file and another great

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
in escalada file and another great
advantage<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.680> loading<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.580> main

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
advantage is the loading in your main

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.929 
advantage is the loading in your main
program<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.930> my<00:00:28.109> case<00:00:28.170> again<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
program or in my case again will be a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
program or in my case again will be a
lot<00:00:30.179> more<00:00:30.359> efficient<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> lot<00:00:31.410> faster<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
lot more efficient and a lot faster and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.850 
lot more efficient and a lot faster and
just<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> purpose<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.230> tutorial

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
just for the purpose of this tutorial

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
can see I've made a little animated cube

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.540 
can see I've made a little animated cube
here<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> 3ds<00:00:41.940> max<00:00:42.320> now<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> software<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
here in 3ds max now the software you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
here in 3ds max now the software you
used<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.149> create<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:46.309> animated<00:00:47.309> model

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
used to create your animated model

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.610 
used to create your animated model
doesn't<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.149> matter<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.750> make<00:00:49.260> sure<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
doesn't really matter just make sure you

doesn't really matter just make sure you
can<00:00:49.770> end<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> Claddagh<00:00:50.700> file<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.219> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
can end up with a Claddagh file and in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.880 
can end up with a Claddagh file and in
my<00:00:53.399> case<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.969> 3ds<00:00:54.449> max<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> export

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
make sure you take that off egg

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
make sure you take that off egg
animation<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.799> means<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
animation basically means that the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.219 
animation basically means that the
exported<00:01:31.560> file<00:01:32.000> which<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.299> create<00:01:33.600> will

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
exported file which you will create will

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.969 
exported file which you will create will
contain<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.810> animation<00:01:36.810> data<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.530> frame

or time key and not necessarily a change
in<00:01:41.479> animation<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.610> big<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.540> fake<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
in animation it's big it's a bit fake I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
in animation it's big it's a bit fake I
know<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.310> more

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
know but if you want to know more

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.950 
know but if you want to know more
information<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> just

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
information about that if you just

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.389 
information about that if you just
google<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.560> course<00:01:50.060> okay<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
google it of course okay and this is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.859 
google it of course okay and this is a
final<00:01:53.700> given<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:55.070> Pakistan<00:01:56.070> CAE<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
final given up with Pakistan CAE as you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.780 
final given up with Pakistan CAE as you
can<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.140> there's<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> lot<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.890> information<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can see there's a lot of information a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
can see there's a lot of information a
lot<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.060> information<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.200> don't

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
lot of information which we don't

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.550 
lot of information which we don't
actually<00:02:01.590> need<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.439> do

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
actually need and I think we can do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
actually need and I think we can do
better<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.360> we're<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.110> with

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
better and we're going to do that with

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.259 
better and we're going to do that with
the<00:02:08.069> program<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.759> PI<00:02:09.239> F<00:02:09.420> program

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
the program I PI F program

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.110 
the program I PI F program
you<00:02:12.269> can<00:02:12.650> debug<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.099> an<00:02:14.250> idea<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.879> your

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you can debug it in an idea of your

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.920 
you can debug it in an idea of your
choice<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.909> just<00:02:18.090> execute<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
choice or you can just execute a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.800

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
a quick overview right here first of all

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.270 
a quick overview right here first of all
we<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.449> bones<00:04:15.870> order<00:04:16.500> joints<00:04:16.949> of<00:04:17.039> course

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
we have the bones order joints of course

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.899 
we have the bones order joints of course
and<00:04:17.970> joint<00:04:18.599> account<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:20.070> burned<00:04:20.370> unisys

and joint account with the burned unisys

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.020 
and joint account with the burned unisys
then<00:04:21.510> we<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.779> D<00:04:21.930> inverse<00:04:22.349> bind<00:04:22.800> matrix

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
then we have D inverse bind matrix

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.170 
then we have D inverse bind matrix
the<00:04:24.120> weights<00:04:24.480> and<00:04:24.810> counts<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:26.180> animation

those are basically all the time keys
and<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:38.280> lost<00:04:38.940> we<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:40.130> animation
