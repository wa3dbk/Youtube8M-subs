00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.770
 Hi everyone Thank you as much as you can teach guitar know-how 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 nb 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:22.430
 This guitar course is f also a hotel Aso b 8 Beginners are easy to stumble Somewhat middle class people 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.900
 Easy to hold action Well then also aid the people of the senior person is a pay bar its berth 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.180
 I will talk about how you say that you are not good at overcoming 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.200
 This is not everything anymore 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.230
 If you can look at it without reference 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.500
 It is the first thing I think is good 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.490
 Yeah it's also been published but f is the code 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.190
 Is this kind of domination are you with you after all weak Te 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.680
 It is fine and I say this volleyball code 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.820
 Well 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 The wind of how the first out how to focus 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.859
 I think that you think, but in fact, how is such a valley code like this 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.280
 Do you lose power 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.710
 It is important of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.180
 At the beginning this way to hold back 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.180
 The mon you are not familiar with respect to say Rutte put a grip to put the power in hand to reverse 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 I think that I can not hold back that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.689
 That 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.240
 To say to continue its long period to some extent the progress to be carried out for one hour a day Toka 2 hours 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.079
 After all that long draw 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.080
 It's a close live, and I'll pick it up 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.330
 Even though I think that people Toka often do the Takuroku own recording 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.040
 After all it will be 3 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.580
 I right hand Once was more of'm tired that left-handed with people of the left hand 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 Because those who are action 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.750
 So how do you do your best 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.899
 As I gradually get used to it, I think that some people will see it, but like f 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.899
 To 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.480
 There is a way to curb it, even in advanced professionals 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.690
 With thumb 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:10.030
 Neun pressing a fret sixth string 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:15.700
 The neck can that do really this also but I'm comfortable 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.830
 It is also important to choose the one with a thin neck, but if it is too thin then c 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.180
 But if Toka is good to hold the basic code of the number 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:30.959
 There is also a demerit that the finger hits other dogs . 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.340
 So just look for the thin child of the neck just because the code is easy to hold down 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.970
 Also 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.190
 It's a difficult place, and to put it the other way round 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 Classical guitar but it is thick with roots something 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.260
 So 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.960
 These were Chords You can Once you get used but these were Chords 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 I do not see so much 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.550
 So although a little story was derailed 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:03:01.510
 Also I'd keep doing that what the wind and I do of course this if we 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:04.740
 If we come out, we will put more power on the remaining middle finger ring finger little finger than putting pressure on the child's index finger 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.890
 It must be only three this put 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.530
 I 'm doing a little bad example right now , but if the original comes out with only these three 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.500
 As a report, the questionnaire is cleaned up 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.220
 To b of the code to pass in 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.640
 Even the middle finger ring finger little finger 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 After that there is also 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.050
 How do you feel 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.650
 Sound is realized 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:32.500
 So what about trying to protect the first house and try 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.330
 Of course all of the matters that must have to become that all of the matter is there that kept 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 It is important though 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.120
 So how 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.800
 Do you let go 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.569
 The wind of how so code is pushed by the force of the final limit 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:50.069
 If you changed that way of thinking 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.650
 Feelings are also becoming easier to that it pains 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.790
 Also in the Well cheap guitar 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.670
 In I think you and seeded to 10,000 yen 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.569
 I'm doing it so much I remember from Cauchy I remember Lee I remember something 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.650
 that stumbled'm really too good to say I quit guitar came to f Toka b 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.510
 so 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.510
 Once you get used to it 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.549
 a 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:20.019
 Ideas come to be granted a variety I melody ended without drawn Toka action 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.800
 Come to be able to suppress various actions without 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.060
 You will be able to write clothes too 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.230
 There are individual differences, so I don't dare mention that it's months or years 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.849
 But also 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:37.110
 It was only when I reached such a point that I had an examination of the real music 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.340
 I think you can get 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:46.370
 So as not to stumble as much as possible Te its f Toka p 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.480
 Please try and for that kind of person I will not squeeze the wisdom without it 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.110
 Than I would let us continue guitar course 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.790
 Even though I know it is it that another proposal 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.280
 I mentioned the previous video a little bit, but the code of f 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.050
 To the wind major 7th in the picture book 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.120
 The index finger I think you can Tteyuu 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.510
 Well 2 cases 1 fret 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.650
 So the middle finger is 3 frets 2 frets 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.230
 The ring finger 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.880
 Well it's 3 frets of 4 strings so 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.880
 This is from 4 cases 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.700
 If it is this, it is perfect 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.280
 It becomes action of that major seventh, but this index finger 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.660
 One string and two strings 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.890
 Hold the 1st and 2nd strings of the 1st bait and the middle finger 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.860
 3 strings 2 frets 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:44.250
 so 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:47.550
 The ring finger and the 4 frets 3 frets will make the af and close sound 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.060
 There are a lot of big things coming up with this 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.060
 After all 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.460
 If it is the way of holding if this is also after the correction because it is a evil way 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.050
 Recognition that there is no 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.889
 I will hold such an eighth code on that 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:11.060
 It is one way to cope with such things 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:13.540
 Or if you really want to avoid those things 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.970
 For example, when you play and talk 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.970
 I used to use kapotasuto before , though 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:27.440
 For example, if it is f in the past, it will be overworked if you hold the cd in the form of 5 frets 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:32.180
 It is recommended two of these ways of holding , but 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.630
 Please think that this is a cap, so let's start here 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.630
 Hmm 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.520
 Hmmm I think this 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.960
 Just say two high 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.500
 And it went as Well of os 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.830
 Because it is a hearing 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.210
 It entered the 5 fret 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.750
 I 'm going to 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.810
 cd chai and 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.320
 In that part, write it out 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.760
 Only now 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:03.100
 That Dzura was because I was in any event Well this code in this kind of wind such a street countries 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.689
 It is necessary to write out that you represent in other actions. 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:11.030
 The code is only now because I shifted the fret 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:14.160
 I have to go down the price or I have to go up 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:18.680
 Such things also little by little 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:22.780
 How the chord works The fret mechanism works with the scale 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.800
 I 've been touching with videos a little bit , but I'm following those things 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:31.289
 In order to overcome that little by little 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:33.220
 Please try your best If there are any other troubles or comments on this video 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:37.930
 I will leave the field open 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.390
 If you ask that question, you can think together with you 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.610
 To 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:44.540
 I think so 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:49.720
 If you think that you can not answer in the text 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:51.590
 There are also times when I make that video I do not know that all that can not be answered 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.460
 The range that can be 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.520
 We would like to both thinking what Tteyuu so went weak overcome method 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.600
 Thank you in the future 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.600
 Thank you for watching
