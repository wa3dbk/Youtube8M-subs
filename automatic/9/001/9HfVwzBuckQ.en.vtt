secret to this trick is it's going to be

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.819 
secret to this trick is it's going to be
behind<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.299> paper<00:01:22.570> towel<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.900> whole<00:01:23.049> time<00:01:23.229> at

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
behind the paper towel the whole time at

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.370 
behind the paper towel the whole time at

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the end you're gonna unravel it so you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.289 
the end you're gonna unravel it so you
don't<00:01:26.530> want<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.640> don't<00:01:27.670> want<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.999> to<00:01:28.060> be<00:01:28.119> so
