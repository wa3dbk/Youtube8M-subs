00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
forget about

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.070 
forget about
here<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.250> over<00:02:12.790> here<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.240> my<00:02:13.390> sort<00:02:14.050> of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
here is over here this is my sort of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.370 
here is over here this is my sort of
terminus<00:02:14.530> station<00:02:14.860> at<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.820> moment<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.380> HST

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
terminus station at the moment the HST

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.040 
terminus station at the moment the HST
and<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.520> couple<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.880> steamers<00:02:19.210> are<00:02:19.600> hanging<00:02:19.990> out

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and a couple of steamers are hanging out

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.890 
and a couple of steamers are hanging out
in<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.760> eventually<00:02:21.760> I'd<00:02:22.240> like<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.660> but

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
in here eventually I'd like to but

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.110 
in here eventually I'd like to but
extend<00:02:23.410> both<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.710> these<00:02:23.800> platforms<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
extend both of these platforms so that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.550 
extend both of these platforms so that
they<00:02:25.300> go<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> little<00:02:25.660> further<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:26.380> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
they go a little further up there and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
they go a little further up there and
then<00:02:26.950> put<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.750> terminus<00:02:29.160> building<00:02:30.160> right<00:02:30.310> there

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
then put a terminus building right there

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.310 
then put a terminus building right there
and<00:02:31.870> then<00:02:32.830> I'd<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> have<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.780> know<00:02:34.900> this

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
and then I'd like to have you know this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.140 
and then I'd like to have you know this
station<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.830> closer<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.400> side<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
station be closer to that side so it's a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.450 
station be closer to that side so it's a
another<00:02:37.840> platform<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.310> more

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
another platform and then one more

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.800 
another platform and then one more
platform<00:02:39.880> on<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:39.970> other<00:02:40.120> side<00:02:40.360> here<00:02:40.630> that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
platform on the other side here that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.380 
platform on the other side here that
will<00:02:41.290> take<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> little<00:02:41.590> while<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.390> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
will take a little while because that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.590 
will take a little while because that
needs<00:02:43.660> two<00:02:44.380> more<00:02:44.850> switches<00:02:45.850> which<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.420> don't

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
needs two more switches which I don't

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.680 
needs two more switches which I don't
feel<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:46.960> buying<00:02:47.170> right<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.630> will

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
feel like buying right now and it will

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.540 
feel like buying right now and it will
take<00:02:49.930> me<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.320> while<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.800> build<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.340> little

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
take me a while to build the little

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.600 
take me a while to build the little
station<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:54.070> yeah<00:02:54.220> that's<00:02:54.370> pretty<00:02:54.430> much

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
station so yeah that's pretty much

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.010 
station so yeah that's pretty much
what's<00:02:55.420> going<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.730> circuit<00:02:57.730> I've<00:02:57.910> got<00:02:58.120> up

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
what's going on the circuit I've got up

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.510 
what's going on the circuit I've got up
and<00:02:59.200> running<00:02:59.320> let's<00:02:59.500> follow<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.890> class<00:03:00.070> 350

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
and running let's follow the class 350

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.110 
and running let's follow the class 350
run<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.060> where<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.240> goes<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:03.940> come

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
run you can see where it goes so we come

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.970 
run you can see where it goes so we come
out<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.600> station<00:03:05.670> we've<00:03:06.670> got<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.150> double

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
out of this station we've got a double

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.440 
out of this station we've got a double
I'm<00:03:08.980> sure<00:03:09.160> left<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.520> right<00:03:09.670> cross<00:03:09.940> over<00:03:10.240> there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
I'm sure left to right cross over there

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.300 
I'm sure left to right cross over there
I'm<00:03:11.110> sorry<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.380> right-handed<00:03:11.950> crossover

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
I'm sorry I right-handed crossover

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.460 
I'm sorry I right-handed crossover
around<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:13.420> corner<00:03:14.200> here<00:03:14.500> all<00:03:14.980> three<00:03:15.220> yay

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
around this corner here all three yay

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.850 
around this corner here all three yay
and<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.590> goes<00:03:17.769> into<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> other<00:03:18.130> room<00:03:19.860> where

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
and this goes into the other room where

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.680 
and this goes into the other room where
we<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.489> very<00:03:21.820> short<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:24.730> turn<00:03:25.060> around

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.490 

and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:28.870> go<00:03:28.959> straight<00:03:29.170> back<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and then we go straight back in the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.890 
and then we go straight back in the
other<00:03:29.620> room<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.239> enough<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.750> I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
other room this is just enough so that I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.090 
other room this is just enough so that I
can<00:03:32.019> run<00:03:32.170> two<00:03:32.410> trains<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.860> same<00:03:32.920> track

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
can run two trains on the same track

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.890 
can run two trains on the same track
you'll<00:03:33.730> see<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> Pendolino<00:03:34.300> come<00:03:34.570> around<00:03:34.720> any

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
you'll see the Pendolino come around any

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.680 
you'll see the Pendolino come around any
second

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.900 

and<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.960> is<00:03:41.230> when<00:03:42.220> they<00:03:42.310> go<00:03:42.460> under<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> sofa

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
and that is when they go under the sofa

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.510 
and that is when they go under the sofa
and<00:03:45.910> then<00:03:46.540> come<00:03:46.720> out<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.020> end<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.460> other

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
and then come out the end of the other

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.790 
and then come out the end of the other
end<00:03:48.610> there

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.880 

see<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.610> enables<00:03:58.030> me<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.210> run<00:03:58.890> several

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
see this enables me to run several

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.710 
see this enables me to run several
different<00:04:00.250> trains<00:04:00.460> at<00:04:00.580> once<00:04:00.790> on<00:04:01.390> different

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
different trains at once on different

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.330 
different trains at once on different
kinds<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.970> services<00:04:03.970> shall<00:04:04.390> we<00:04:04.510> say<00:04:05.220> we've<00:04:06.220> got

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
kinds of services shall we say we've got

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.990 
kinds of services shall we say we've got
class<00:04:06.580> one<00:04:06.790> five<00:04:07.000> three<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.440> stop

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
class one five three that can stop

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.460 
class one five three that can stop
either<00:04:10.000> at<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.330> station<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.080> can<00:04:11.200> go<00:04:11.320> into

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
either at the station or it can go into

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.050 
either at the station or it can go into
my<00:04:11.710> little<00:04:12.100> bay<00:04:12.520> platform<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:15.060> pendolino

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
my little bay platform there pendolino

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.449 
my little bay platform there pendolino
just<00:04:16.600> kind<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.840> zooms<00:04:17.380> around<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.890> outer<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
just kind of zooms around the outer the

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.860 
just kind of zooms around the outer the
outer<00:04:18.489> track<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.030> then<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.209> can<00:04:19.360> reverse<00:04:19.690> it

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
outer track and then I can reverse it

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.870 
outer track and then I can reverse it
into<00:04:20.080> one<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.500> terminus<00:04:21.310> sightings<00:04:21.700> over
