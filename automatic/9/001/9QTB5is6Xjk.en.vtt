earth in their migratory behavior an
interesting<00:00:19.920> example<00:00:20.060> are<00:00:21.060> actually<00:00:21.570> monarch

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
interesting example are actually monarch

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.939 
interesting example are actually monarch
butterflies<00:00:22.529> that's<00:00:23.189> an<00:00:23.430> interface<00:00:24.000> between

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
butterflies that's an interface between

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
butterflies that's an interface between
their<00:00:25.949> antennae<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.269> magnetic<00:00:27.750> field<00:00:27.779> of

their antennae and the magnetic field of
the<00:00:28.260> earth<00:00:28.380> what's<00:00:29.279> unique<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:30.060> work

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the earth what's unique about our work

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040 
the earth what's unique about our work
is<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.640> created<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.120> cell<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.019> will

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is that we have created a cell that will

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.969 
is that we have created a cell that will
migrate<00:00:34.410> towards<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> magnet<00:00:36.140> our<00:00:37.140> study<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979 
migrate towards a magnet our study is

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.939 
migrate towards a magnet our study is
the<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.760> demonstration<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.839> to<00:00:40.710> make

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
the first demonstration that to make

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.110 
the first demonstration that to make
numb<00:00:41.790> naturally<00:00:42.750> non-magnetic<00:00:43.580> organism<00:00:44.580> to

numb naturally non-magnetic organism to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.680 
numb naturally non-magnetic organism to
magnetic<00:00:46.049> what<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.949> partly<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> motivation

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
magnetic what is partly the motivation

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.100 
magnetic what is partly the motivation
behind<00:00:48.720> our<00:00:49.379> work<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.570> bacteria<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:52.049> are

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
behind our work is bacteria that are

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.700 
behind our work is bacteria that are
magnetic<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:54.750> may<00:00:55.080> it's<00:00:55.470> not

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
magnetic and it's that may it's not

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.910 
magnetic and it's that may it's not
clear<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.420> they're<00:00:57.420> magnetic<00:00:57.869> it<00:00:58.530> may<00:00:58.860> be

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
clear why they're magnetic it may be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
clear why they're magnetic it may be
sort<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.369> an<00:00:59.489> evolutionary<00:01:00.360> artifact<00:01:01.049> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sort of an evolutionary artifact but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
sort of an evolutionary artifact but
they<00:01:01.650> can<00:01:01.920> align<00:01:02.610> themselves<00:01:02.909> with<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they can align themselves with the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
they can align themselves with the
magnetic<00:01:03.960> field<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> earth<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.460> as

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
magnetic field of the earth and as

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.030 
magnetic field of the earth and as
humans<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.229> find<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
humans we can actually find this to be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.540 
humans we can actually find this to be
very<00:01:08.340> useful<00:01:08.870> in<00:01:09.870> terms<00:01:10.230> of<00:01:10.470> remediation<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
very useful in terms of remediation and

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.350 
very useful in terms of remediation and
things<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.030> that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.200 

so<00:01:16.990> first<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.410> all<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:18.190> basis<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.850> magnet

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
so first of all the basis for the magnet

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.230 
so first of all the basis for the magnet
magnetism<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.470> uptake<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.370> iron<00:01:21.790> by<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
magnetism is the uptake of iron by the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.220 
magnetism is the uptake of iron by the
cells<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:22.960> iron<00:01:23.170> can<00:01:23.560> become<00:01:23.950> magnetic<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.720> so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
cells so iron can become magnetic and so

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.440 
cells so iron can become magnetic and so
the<00:01:26.380> cells<00:01:26.650> will<00:01:26.920> naturally<00:01:27.160> take<00:01:27.610> up<00:01:28.090> iron

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
the cells will naturally take up iron

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.770 
the cells will naturally take up iron
but<00:01:29.410> normally<00:01:30.190> they<00:01:30.220> will<00:01:30.760> sequester<00:01:31.660> it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
but normally they will sequester it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.920 
but normally they will sequester it
inside<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.820> compartment<00:01:33.820> in<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.120> cell<00:01:34.540> that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
inside a compartment in the cell that's

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.040 
inside a compartment in the cell that's
called<00:01:35.229> an<00:01:35.380> organelle<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.060> when<00:01:37.780> it's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
called an organelle and when it's

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.400 
called an organelle and when it's
sequestered<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.700> cells<00:01:40.030> are<00:01:40.390> not<00:01:41.200> very

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
sequestered the cells are not very

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.630 
sequestered the cells are not very
magnetic<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:44.020> thing<00:01:44.229> we<00:01:44.440> did<00:01:44.770> was<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
magnetic so one thing we did was to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
magnetic so one thing we did was to
eliminate<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:47.310> inhibit<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.700> normal<00:01:49.180> ability

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
eliminate and inhibit the normal ability

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.530 
eliminate and inhibit the normal ability
of<00:01:49.750> cells<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.229> hide<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.830> iron<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:52.330> make<00:01:52.509> it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
of cells to hide the iron and to make it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.890 
of cells to hide the iron and to make it
more<00:01:52.690> exposed<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:54.400> second<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.300> increase

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
more exposed the second is to increase

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.930 
more exposed the second is to increase
the<00:01:56.650> uptake<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.030> end<00:01:58.300> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
the uptake and this end the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.130 
the uptake and this end the
crystallization<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.030> iron<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.720> make<00:02:01.990> it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
crystallization of iron to make it

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.530 
crystallization of iron to make it
magnetic<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.550> third<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.330> manipulate

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
magnetic and the third is to manipulate

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.710 
magnetic and the third is to manipulate
to<00:02:05.200> fool<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.770> cells<00:02:06.100> into<00:02:07.060> creating<00:02:07.570> an

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
to fool the cells into creating an

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.719 
to fool the cells into creating an
environment<00:02:08.110> where<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.800> iron<00:02:09.009> will<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.369> more

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
environment where the iron will be more

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.220 
environment where the iron will be more
magnetic

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.040 

well<00:02:15.349> my<00:02:15.530> favorite<00:02:15.950> experiment<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.750> we

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
well my favorite experiment that that we

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.970 
well my favorite experiment that that we
did<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.620> when<00:02:19.010> i<00:02:19.040> say<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.400> i<00:02:19.580> really<00:02:20.120> mean<00:02:20.269> kg

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
did and when i say we i really mean kg

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.020 
did and when i say we i really mean kg
is<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.879> he<00:02:23.209> could<00:02:23.450> take<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.140> cells<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.040> put

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
is that he could take the cells and put

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.009 
is that he could take the cells and put
them<00:02:26.269> in<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.959> dish<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.920> then<00:02:28.849> hold<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.420> magnet

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
them in a dish and then hold a magnet

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.860 
them in a dish and then hold a magnet
underneath<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.980> dish<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.209> cells<00:02:32.540> would

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
underneath the dish and the cells would

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.190 
underneath the dish and the cells would
migrate<00:02:33.200> towards<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.340> magnet<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.150> he<00:02:35.989> could

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
migrate towards the magnet and he could

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.470 
migrate towards the magnet and he could
have<00:02:36.440> them<00:02:36.650> make<00:02:36.860> patterns<00:02:37.519> in<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.239> dish

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
have them make patterns in the dish

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.589 
have them make patterns in the dish
depending<00:02:39.379> on<00:02:39.379> where<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.950> magnet<00:02:40.430> was<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
depending on where the magnet was and so

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.119 
depending on where the magnet was and so
one<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.959> things<00:02:42.019> he<00:02:42.379> did<00:02:42.560> was<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.950> them

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
one of the things he did was have them

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.500 
one of the things he did was have them
make<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> pattern<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.150> face

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.679 

there's<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.650> potential<00:02:49.189> medical

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
there's the potential medical

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.179 
there's the potential medical
applications<00:02:50.689> there's<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.739> potential<00:02:52.010> for

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
applications there's the potential for

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:58.390 
applications there's the potential for
applications<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:56.439> bio<00:02:57.439> processing

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
applications in in bio processing

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.699 
applications in in bio processing
there's<00:02:58.909> potential<00:02:59.450> applications<00:03:00.170> for

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
there's potential applications for

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.250 
there's potential applications for
tissue<00:03:01.129> engineering<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.810> could<00:03:03.079> have

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
tissue engineering it could have

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.490 
tissue engineering it could have
particular<00:03:03.680> importance<00:03:04.579> in<00:03:04.879> bio<00:03:05.500> processing

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
particular importance in bio processing

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.080 
particular importance in bio processing
so<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.220> large<00:03:08.060> vats<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:09.079> cells<00:03:09.500> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
so you have large vats of cells and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.819 
so you have large vats of cells and
sometimes<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.299> need<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.540> pull<00:03:12.200> out<00:03:12.230> either

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
sometimes you need to pull out either

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.640 
sometimes you need to pull out either
the<00:03:13.099> bad<00:03:13.310> cells<00:03:13.819> or<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.420> good<00:03:14.599> cells<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.500> so

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
the bad cells or the good cells and so

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.289 
the bad cells or the good cells and so
you<00:03:15.739> could<00:03:16.010> imagine<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.790> had<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.939> giant

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
you could imagine if you had a giant

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.259 
you could imagine if you had a giant
magnet<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.530> could<00:03:18.739> suck<00:03:19.129> out<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.400> good<00:03:19.879> cells

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
magnet you could suck out the good cells

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.960 
magnet you could suck out the good cells
from<00:03:20.659> a<00:03:20.780> bio<00:03:20.989> processor<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.579> could<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.879> also

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
from a bio processor it could be also

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.399 
from a bio processor it could be also
possible<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.629> you<00:03:24.200> may<00:03:24.440> be<00:03:24.500> able<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:25.010> to

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
possible that you may be able to to

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.920 
possible that you may be able to to
stimulate<00:03:27.409> cells<00:03:27.829> using<00:03:28.609> external<00:03:29.389> magnet

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
stimulate cells using external magnet

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.629 
stimulate cells using external magnet
and<00:03:31.359> engineer<00:03:32.359> cells<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.349> respond<00:03:33.920> one<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.519> the

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
and engineer cells to respond one of the

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.030 
and engineer cells to respond one of the
interests<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.420> how<00:03:35.870> do<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.139> make<00:03:36.409> living

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
interests is how do you make living

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.449 
interests is how do you make living
forms<00:03:37.730> interface<00:03:38.480> with<00:03:38.840> machines<00:03:39.409> so<00:03:40.370> you

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
forms interface with machines so you

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.509 
forms interface with machines so you
want<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.359> able<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.810> have<00:03:42.049> cells<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.859> can

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
want to be able to have cells that can

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.839 
want to be able to have cells that can
communicate<00:03:43.819> with<00:03:44.389> machines<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.700> is

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
communicate with machines and so this is

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.180 
communicate with machines and so this is
a<00:03:46.879> perfect<00:03:47.420> example<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.709> can<00:03:48.920> have<00:03:49.159> a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
a perfect example of that you can have a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.720 
a perfect example of that you can have a
magnet<00:03:49.909> and<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.239> cell<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.409> be<00:03:51.829> communicating

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
magnet and the cell can be communicating

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.979 
magnet and the cell can be communicating
with<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> magnet<00:03:54.410> could<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> form<00:03:55.280> of

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
with it so the magnet could be a form of

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.020 
with it so the magnet could be a form of
input<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.349> magnetism<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.459> then<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.760> cell

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
input the magnetism and then the cell

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.990 
input the magnetism and then the cell
does<00:03:59.359> something<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.919> this<00:04:01.069> interface<00:04:01.699> of

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
does something and so this interface of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.080 
does something and so this interface of
of<00:04:02.230> life<00:04:03.230> with<00:04:03.560> machines<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:04.519> part<00:04:04.879> of<00:04:04.940> our

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
of life with machines is part of our

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.540 
of life with machines is part of our
future
