hi<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:02.010> my<00:00:02.310> 3d<00:00:02.850> router<00:00:03.149> pantograph<00:00:03.870> I

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi this is my 3d router pantograph I

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi this is my 3d router pantograph I
called<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.680> 3d<00:00:05.069> router<00:00:05.220> pantograph<00:00:05.759> because<00:00:06.089> in

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
called a 3d router pantograph because in

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.390 
called a 3d router pantograph because in
addition<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.569> controlling<00:00:06.750> X<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.350> life<00:00:07.560> you

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
addition to controlling X in life you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
addition to controlling X in life you
can<00:00:08.550> also<00:00:08.730> control<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.360> depth<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.809> cut

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
can also control the depth of cut

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.440 
can also control the depth of cut
because<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.620> has<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> rigid<00:00:11.130> frame<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
because it has a rigid frame and the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.570 
because it has a rigid frame and the
tilting<00:00:12.870> nodes<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> back<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.490> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
tilting nodes on the back so that you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.939 
tilting nodes on the back so that you
can<00:00:14.730> use<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.269> copy<00:00:15.690> 3d<00:00:16.139> objects<00:00:16.560> into<00:00:16.800> other

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
can use it to copy 3d objects into other

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.849 
can use it to copy 3d objects into other
3d<00:00:17.250> effects<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> video<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.680> going

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
3d effects and in this video I'm going

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.170 
3d effects and in this video I'm going
to<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.010> through<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> construction<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to go through the construction of this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.779 
to go through the construction of this
machine<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:22.010> put<00:00:23.010> together<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.550> detailed

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
machine I put together a very detailed

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.670 
machine I put together a very detailed
set<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> plans<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:24.930> using<00:00:25.109> those<00:00:25.350> plans

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
set of plans and I'm using those plans

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.200 
set of plans and I'm using those plans
in<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.980> video<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.430> construct<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> pantograph

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
in this video to construct a pantograph

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.710 
in this video to construct a pantograph
I<00:00:28.730> started<00:00:29.730> by<00:00:29.849> printing<00:00:30.240> one-to-one

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
I started by printing one-to-one

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.290 
I started by printing one-to-one
templates<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.529> my<00:00:31.740> motor<00:00:31.980> mounts<00:00:32.309> pasting

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
templates of my motor mounts pasting

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
templates of my motor mounts pasting
those<00:00:33.450> together<00:00:33.690> into<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.230> sheet<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.890> then

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
those together into a big sheet and then

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.190 
those together into a big sheet and then
gluing<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> piece<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.510> 3/4<00:00:37.020> inch

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
gluing that out to a piece of 3/4 inch

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619 
gluing that out to a piece of 3/4 inch
thick<00:00:37.290> birch<00:00:37.800> plywood<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:39.210> cutting<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
thick birch plywood and then cutting all

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.549 
thick birch plywood and then cutting all
that<00:00:39.780> stuff<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> bandsaw<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:42.559> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that stuff out on the bandsaw if you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
that stuff out on the bandsaw if you
work<00:00:43.739> carefully<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> fine<00:00:44.969> blade<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
work carefully and have a fine blade in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
work carefully and have a fine blade in
the<00:00:45.450> bandsaw<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.559> possible<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> follow

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the bandsaw it's possible to follow

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.690 
the bandsaw it's possible to follow
lines<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.000> surprising<00:00:48.539> accuracy<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.610> cut<00:00:50.610> all

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
lines with surprising accuracy I cut all

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.689 
lines with surprising accuracy I cut all
the<00:00:50.820> straight<00:00:51.059> pieces<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:51.960> hard<00:00:52.199> maple

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
the straight pieces out from hard maple

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
the straight pieces out from hard maple
here<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:53.850> marking<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> positions<00:00:54.870> for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here I'm marking all the positions for

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
here I'm marking all the positions for
all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> holes<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> need<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> drill<00:00:56.219> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
all the holes that I need to drill for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
all the holes that I need to drill for
all<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> pivots<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.539> pantograph

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.830 

now<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.490> holes<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.939> drilled<00:01:09.970> ended<00:01:10.509> up<00:01:10.600> being

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
now the holes I drilled ended up being

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.600 
now the holes I drilled ended up being
very<00:01:10.869> very<00:01:11.259> tight<00:01:11.560> for<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.799> piece<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.100> 3/8<00:01:12.400> inch

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
very very tight for a piece of 3/8 inch

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.450 
very very tight for a piece of 3/8 inch
rod<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:13.990> made<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> sort<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.619> reamer<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.310> of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
rod so I made a sort of reamer out of

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.630 
rod so I made a sort of reamer out of
3/8<00:01:15.909> inch<00:01:16.270> rod<00:01:16.630> which<00:01:17.619> I'd<00:01:17.799> use<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:17.979> expand<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
3/8 inch rod which I'd use to expand the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.770 
3/8 inch rod which I'd use to expand the
holes<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.909> little<00:01:19.000> bit<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.360> that<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.570> shaft

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
holes a little bit so that the shaft

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.789 
holes a little bit so that the shaft
fits<00:01:20.020> more<00:01:20.259> easily

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
fits more easily

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.130 
fits more easily
I<00:01:21.119> made<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.270> reamer<00:01:22.540> by<00:01:22.750> cutting<00:01:23.080> a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
I made that reamer by cutting a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.810 
I made that reamer by cutting a
lengthwise<00:01:23.530> slot<00:01:23.920> near<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.369> end<00:01:24.460> up<00:01:24.610> going

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
lengthwise slot near the end up going

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.270 
lengthwise slot near the end up going
with<00:01:24.940> pieces<00:01:25.149> of<00:01:25.420> 3/16<00:01:26.080> play<00:01:26.259> steel<00:01:26.590> shaft<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
with pieces of 3/16 play steel shaft all

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.920 
with pieces of 3/16 play steel shaft all
the<00:01:30.490> parts<00:01:30.759> for<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.060> pantograph<00:01:31.360> were<00:01:31.720> just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
the parts for the pantograph were just

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.320 
the parts for the pantograph were just
but<00:01:32.200> joined<00:01:32.470> together<00:01:32.619> with<00:01:32.830> glue<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:34.119> not<00:01:34.299> a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
but joined together with glue it's not a

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.760 
but joined together with glue it's not a
high-stress<00:01:34.780> application<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:35.590> that's

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
high-stress application so that's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.039 
high-stress application so that's
actually<00:01:35.890> quite<00:01:36.100> adequate<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.909> do<00:01:37.659> have<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.960> be

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
actually quite adequate I do have to be

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.180 
actually quite adequate I do have to be
very<00:01:38.289> careful<00:01:38.740> getting<00:01:38.979> everything

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
very careful getting everything

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.999 
very careful getting everything
reasonably<00:01:39.880> lined<00:01:40.090> up<00:01:40.530> clamps<00:01:41.530> often<00:01:41.830> cause

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
reasonably lined up clamps often cause

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.919 
reasonably lined up clamps often cause
things<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.429> slip<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:42.909> weighing<00:01:43.450> things<00:01:43.690> down

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
things to slip so weighing things down

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.840 
things to slip so weighing things down
instead<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.319> clamping<00:01:44.740> actually<00:01:45.069> helps<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.340> lot

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.669 

hmm<00:01:48.850> now<00:01:49.450> which<00:01:49.600> plays<00:01:49.869> this<00:01:50.110> part<00:01:50.380> go<00:01:50.500> on

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
hmm now which plays this part go on

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.800 
hmm now which plays this part go on
again<00:01:51.119> let's<00:01:52.119> check<00:01:52.179> that<00:01:52.420> against<00:01:52.720> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
again let's check that against the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.700 
again let's check that against the
one-to-one<00:01:53.110> drawings<00:01:53.590> okay<00:01:54.580> no<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.030> know<00:01:55.149> I<00:02:01.710> can

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
one-to-one drawings okay no I know I can

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.160 
one-to-one drawings okay no I know I can
weighing<00:02:03.009> things<00:02:03.280> down<00:02:03.490> for<00:02:03.700> clamping<00:02:04.170> it's

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.510 
weighing things down for clamping it's
useful<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:05.950> bit<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.069> exercise

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
useful to have a little bit of exercise

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.340 
useful to have a little bit of exercise
equipment<00:02:06.549> around<00:02:07.179> comes<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:07.990> handy<00:02:08.140> in<00:02:08.319> the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
equipment around comes in handy in the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.050 
equipment around comes in handy in the

aligned<00:02:16.510> i<00:02:16.750> actually<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.320> pieces<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> my

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
aligned i actually put pieces of my

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.699 
aligned i actually put pieces of my
steel<00:02:18.100> rod<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.400> there<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.900> really<00:02:20.320> helps

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
steel rod in there and that really helps

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.289 
steel rod in there and that really helps
line<00:02:21.100> things<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:21.640> i<00:02:21.730> squeeze<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.209> together

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
line things up as i squeeze it together

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.729 
line things up as i squeeze it together
i<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:25.209> checked<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> square<00:02:26.170> yeah

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
i just checked that with a square yeah

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:35.970 
i just checked that with a square yeah
it<00:02:26.859> looks<00:02:27.040> good<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.510> here's<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.500> bottom<00:02:35.650> half

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it looks good and here's the bottom half

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.250 
it looks good and here's the bottom half
of<00:02:36.130> my<00:02:36.160> router<00:02:36.579> mount<00:02:36.940> all<00:02:37.180> glued<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
of my router mount all glued up the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.020 
of my router mount all glued up the
holes<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:41.650> router<00:02:41.980> mode<00:02:42.220> were<00:02:42.400> also<00:02:42.730> very

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
holes in my router mode were also very

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.479 
holes in my router mode were also very
very<00:02:43.239> tight<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.109> read<00:02:44.859> those<00:02:45.040> other<00:02:45.250> little

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
very tight so I read those other little

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.800 
very tight so I read those other little
bit<00:02:45.609> to<00:02:45.730> make<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.970> easier<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.329> assemble<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
bit to make it easier to assemble the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.370 
bit to make it easier to assemble the
whole<00:02:46.840> thing

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.740 

I'm<00:02:51.380> using<00:02:51.590> four<00:02:51.950> 3/16<00:02:52.670> inch<00:02:52.910> steel<00:02:53.150> rods<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
I'm using four 3/16 inch steel rods to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.810 
I'm using four 3/16 inch steel rods to
go<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.020> all<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.170> shaft<00:02:54.530> holes<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.670> way<00:02:55.790> I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
go in all the shaft holes that way I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.670 
go in all the shaft holes that way I
have<00:02:56.000> more<00:02:56.240> pins<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.810> line<00:02:57.050> things<00:02:57.290> up<00:02:57.380> as<00:02:57.560> I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
have more pins to line things up as I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:07.150 
have more pins to line things up as I
assemble<00:02:58.070> it<00:03:05.320> now<00:03:06.320> let's<00:03:06.560> check<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.130> a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
assemble it now let's check that with a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.410 
assemble it now let's check that with a
square<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:09.410> looks<00:03:09.740> good

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
square that looks good

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.940 
square that looks good
so<00:03:11.420> let's<00:03:11.630> pry<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.870> apart<00:03:12.050> of<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.470> again<00:03:12.710> so<00:03:12.890> I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
so let's pry it apart of it again so I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:25.180 
so let's pry it apart of it again so I
can<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.250> some<00:03:13.400> glue<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.790> there<00:03:24.010> looks<00:03:25.010> all

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
can get some glue in there looks all

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.750 
can get some glue in there looks all
right<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.470> now<00:03:27.830> let's<00:03:27.860> plot<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.370> thing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
right so now let's plot that thing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.240 
right so now let's plot that thing
together<00:03:35.470> really<00:03:36.470> how<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.740> both<00:03:36.950> holds

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
together really how it both holds

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.440 
together really how it both holds
together<00:03:37.430> kinda<00:03:37.880> makes<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.210> for<00:03:38.390> any

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
together kinda makes up for any

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.090 
together kinda makes up for any
misalignment<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:39.200> may<00:03:39.320> be<00:03:39.380> between<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.860> two

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
misalignment there may be between a two

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.460 
misalignment there may be between a two
of<00:03:40.160> them<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.460> that<00:03:41.360> way<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.720> shaft<00:03:42.050> slides

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
of them and that way this shaft slides

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.200 
of them and that way this shaft slides
in<00:03:42.620> there<00:03:42.770> nice<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.010> easily<00:03:45.370> here's<00:03:46.370> my<00:03:46.640> fixed

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
in there nice and easily here's my fixed

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.510 
in there nice and easily here's my fixed
mount<00:03:47.420> for<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> pantograph<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.250> fixed

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
mount for the pantograph now the fixed

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.120 
mount for the pantograph now the fixed
mount<00:03:49.820> is<00:03:50.090> actually<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.260> affinity<00:03:51.650> axis

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
mount is actually on the affinity axis

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.370 
mount is actually on the affinity axis
which<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:53.330> gives<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.630> pantograph<00:03:53.990> its

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
which is what gives a pantograph its

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.560 
which is what gives a pantograph its
third<00:03:54.620> dimension<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.370> whole<00:03:55.910> mount<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.300> just

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
third dimension the whole mount is just

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.970 
third dimension the whole mount is just
made<00:03:56.780> out<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.140> few<00:03:57.320> pieces<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.740> plywood

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
made out of a few pieces of plywood

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.650 
made out of a few pieces of plywood
glued<00:03:58.370> together<00:03:58.550> without<00:03:58.940> any<00:03:59.060> dowels<00:03:59.450> or

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
glued together without any dowels or

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.020 
glued together without any dowels or
anything<00:04:03.430> now<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.760> put<00:04:04.880> the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
anything now I have to put the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.730 
anything now I have to put the
pantograph<00:04:05.360> links<00:04:05.900> into<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.140> sixth<00:04:06.560> month

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
pantograph links into the sixth month

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.220 
pantograph links into the sixth month
now<00:04:07.730> this<00:04:07.940> part<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.510> bit<00:04:08.630> tricky<00:04:08.690> because

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
now this part is a bit tricky because

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.750 
now this part is a bit tricky because
you<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.709> get<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:09.980> orientation<00:04:10.430> just

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
you have to get the orientation just

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.610 
you have to get the orientation just
right<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.300> actually<00:04:11.870> had<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.260> film<00:04:12.470> this

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
right I actually had to film this

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.050 
right I actually had to film this
several<00:04:12.860> times<00:04:12.980> upon<00:04:13.430> us<00:04:13.550> because<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:13.850> got<00:04:13.970> it

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
several times upon us because I got it

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
several times upon us because I got it
wrong<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.390> first<00:04:14.570> time<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:15.310> here's<00:04:16.310> thinking

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
wrong the first time so here's thinking

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.370 
wrong the first time so here's thinking
my<00:04:17.060> shaft<00:04:17.330> in<00:04:17.510> there<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:18.080> little<00:04:18.290> bit

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
my shaft in there it's a little bit

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.680 
my shaft in there it's a little bit
sticky<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:18.739> that's<00:04:19.040> okay<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.540> be<00:04:20.660> a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
sticky but that's okay for it to be a

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.290 
sticky but that's okay for it to be a
bit<00:04:20.959> tight<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:24.160> now<00:04:25.160> pushing<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.730> shaft<00:04:26.000> all

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
bit tight and now pushing the shaft all

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:42.529 
bit tight and now pushing the shaft all
the<00:04:26.450> way<00:04:26.570> through

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.820 

now<00:04:43.539> putting<00:04:43.869> the<00:04:43.990> router<00:04:44.199> mode<00:04:44.439> link<00:04:44.679> in

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
now putting the router mode link in

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.889 
now putting the router mode link in
there<00:04:45.039> this<00:04:45.759> part<00:04:46.029> is<00:04:46.089> also<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.360> bit<00:04:46.509> tricky<00:04:46.809> to

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:46.899 
there this part is also a bit tricky to

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:48.449 
there this part is also a bit tricky to
make<00:04:47.020> sure<00:04:47.199> you<00:04:47.349> have<00:04:47.529> the<00:04:47.649> right<00:04:47.860> holes

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:48.459 
make sure you have the right holes

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:50.519 
make sure you have the right holes
I've<00:04:49.209> actually<00:04:49.389> miss<00:04:49.779> assembled<00:04:50.259> my<00:04:50.379> own

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
I've actually miss assembled my own

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.399 
I've actually miss assembled my own
quite<00:04:51.339> a<00:04:51.399> few<00:04:51.550> times<00:04:51.789> but<00:04:52.779> this<00:04:53.199> is<00:04:53.319> the

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
quite a few times but this is the

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.209 
quite a few times but this is the
correct<00:04:53.709> way<00:04:53.800> for<00:04:54.159> the<00:04:54.249> 1/2<00:04:55.050> magnification

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
correct way for the 1/2 magnification

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.999 
correct way for the 1/2 magnification
now<00:04:57.219> here's<00:04:57.490> adding<00:04:57.879> the<00:04:58.059> pin<00:04:58.659> for<00:04:59.020> tracing<00:04:59.649> my

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
now here's adding the pin for tracing my

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.980 
now here's adding the pin for tracing my
actual<00:05:00.429> pattern<00:05:00.819> and<00:05:01.569> there's<00:05:01.779> been<00:05:01.959> a

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
actual pattern and there's been a

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.929 
actual pattern and there's been a
locking<00:05:02.439> knob<00:05:02.589> on<00:05:02.770> there<00:05:02.949> where<00:05:03.129> I<00:05:03.159> can<00:05:03.550> set

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
locking knob on there where I can set

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.790 
locking knob on there where I can set
the<00:05:04.059> height<00:05:04.209> of<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.479> which<00:05:05.110> also<00:05:05.259> sets<00:05:05.649> how

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the height of it which also sets how

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:21.389 
the height of it which also sets how
deep<00:05:06.009> my<00:05:06.189> router<00:05:06.399> cuts<00:05:20.129> there's<00:05:21.129> a<00:05:21.219> few

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:21.399 
deep my router cuts there's a few

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.889 
deep my router cuts there's a few
chapters<00:05:21.849> that<00:05:21.999> need<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.270> be<00:05:22.300> cut<00:05:22.569> out<00:05:22.689> of<00:05:22.839> the

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:22.899 
chapters that need to be cut out of the

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:24.389 
chapters that need to be cut out of the
mechanism<00:05:23.379> here<00:05:23.619> and<00:05:23.709> there<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.009> get<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.249> full

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
mechanism here and there to get the full

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:27.209 
mechanism here and there to get the full
range<00:05:24.459> of<00:05:24.729> motion<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:26.050> easiest<00:05:26.439> to<00:05:26.529> just<00:05:26.860> not

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
range of motion it's easiest to just not

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.949 
range of motion it's easiest to just not
cut<00:05:27.490> these<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.999> then<00:05:28.149> once<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.479> things<00:05:28.719> put

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:28.959 
cut these and then once the things put

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.559 
cut these and then once the things put
together<00:05:29.050> look<00:05:29.979> at<00:05:30.129> where<00:05:30.279> it<00:05:30.369> bumps<00:05:30.699> and<00:05:30.999> cut

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
together look at where it bumps and cut

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:40.259 
together look at where it bumps and cut
it<00:05:31.659> out<00:05:31.749> with<00:05:31.869> a<00:05:31.899> knife<00:05:38.729> so<00:05:39.729> here's<00:05:40.089> the

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:40.269 
it out with a knife so here's the

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:41.850 
it out with a knife so here's the
pantograph<00:05:40.779> in<00:05:41.139> one<00:05:41.349> half<00:05:41.559> scale

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
pantograph in one half scale

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.579 
pantograph in one half scale
magnification<00:05:42.729> so<00:05:43.629> let's<00:05:43.839> switch<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.319> over

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
magnification so let's switch that over

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.429 
magnification so let's switch that over
to<00:05:44.709> the<00:05:44.800> 1/3<00:05:45.309> position<00:05:45.839> so<00:05:46.839> we<00:05:47.080> just<00:05:47.229> have<00:05:47.409> to

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
to the 1/3 position so we just have to

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:57.499 
to the 1/3 position so we just have to
take<00:05:47.680> out<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.039> it<00:05:48.159> of<00:05:48.249> pins

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.029 

now<00:05:58.509> with<00:05:58.659> the<00:05:58.779> pins<00:05:59.019> out<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.529> amount<00:05:59.740> just

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
now with the pins out the amount just

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.459 
now with the pins out the amount just
sliced<00:06:00.399> diagonally<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:01.419> then<00:06:02.019> we<00:06:02.139> put<00:06:02.349> the

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
sliced diagonally and then we put the

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:17.769 
sliced diagonally and then we put the
pins<00:06:02.709> in<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.009> other<00:06:03.129> set<00:06:03.339> of<00:06:03.369> holes

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.989 

and<00:06:18.779> now<00:06:19.469> things<00:06:19.830> configured<00:06:20.339> for<00:06:20.519> 1/3

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:20.999 
and now things configured for 1/3

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.909 
and now things configured for 1/3
magnification<00:06:24.289> so<00:06:25.289> here's<00:06:25.499> the<00:06:25.619> pantograph

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
magnification so here's the pantograph

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.159 
magnification so here's the pantograph
all<00:06:26.249> done<00:06:26.459> I'll<00:06:27.269> make<00:06:27.509> more<00:06:27.629> videos<00:06:27.929> showing

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
all done I'll make more videos showing

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.479 
all done I'll make more videos showing
all<00:06:28.409> the<00:06:28.499> things<00:06:28.709> that<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:28.949> thing<00:06:29.189> can<00:06:29.309> do

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:29.489 
all the things that this thing can do

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.549 
all the things that this thing can do
and<00:06:29.729> if<00:06:30.479> you<00:06:30.569> want<00:06:30.689> to<00:06:30.779> build<00:06:30.869> an<00:06:31.019> exact<00:06:31.349> copy

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
and if you want to build an exact copy

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.229 
and if you want to build an exact copy
of<00:06:31.800> it<00:06:31.889> I<00:06:32.009> do<00:06:32.069> have<00:06:32.279> a<00:06:32.309> set<00:06:32.639> of<00:06:32.729> plans<00:06:32.999> available

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.239 
of it I do have a set of plans available

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:36.649 
of it I do have a set of plans available
on<00:06:33.599> my<00:06:33.689> website<00:06:34.080> that<00:06:34.110> you<00:06:34.349> can<00:06:34.469> buy
