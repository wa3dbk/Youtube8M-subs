00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.559
 Hello and welcome to mixtape 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 Michael the oliver wrote to me 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.320
 has a question and that is what is on the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 Product tribulus terrestris really 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 Many greetings from Switzerland many 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 Greetings back to the oliver there are many 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 Studies that have examined tribulus 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 terrestris what about the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.100
 Testosterone increase because that will be yes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.020
 always propagated when the tribulus notes 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 at the word group that already propagates that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 these studies the results were even 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.289
 nothing is sinking again 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 of testosterone yet another increase of 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.450
 testosterone 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.039
 the four studies directly to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.199
 have looked at testosterone 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.820
 if you study another one now 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.340
 Also double-blind looks good 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 performed with young people 18 to 29 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 and respectively 8 and 18 to 44 were the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 have since taken six grams daily 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.270
 and they had an improvement no 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.520
 sorry these 18 to 44 year olds 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 already had a low sperm count 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 that means they actually had one 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.450
 problem and work six grams for 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 Taken 60 days and have 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.650
 erectile properties improved 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 a bit better recovery so the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 Regeneration is not like that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 weak felt the whole day but 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 it went better and the libido 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.320
 has been increased that is it was 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 actually had more sex 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.290
 that means, as always, but always 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 assuming you are at this double 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.390
 you linked it down here below 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.950
 As I said there was already a castle 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.799
 around present 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 that is, if that seems to exist 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.270
 There is a possibility to give it 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.590
 I'm allowed the six grams and not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.899
 recommend because the over the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.119
 recommended consumption of germany 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.909
 I would not do it here either 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.129
 I would even advise against it 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.119
 because that's not the case in German 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.090
 traffic capacity 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.239
 may be taken or 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.680
 may be recommended only whole 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.489
 The study situation is not so 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.430
 was allowed as always before I 40 euros 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.930
 should raushauen for a month pack 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.799
 I already think about it if I can 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.640
 is worth 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.640
 in this libido and erectile dysfunction 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.239
 that testosterone failed 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.200
 the testosterone was a bit 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.910
 increase by 16 I think so 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.040
 not statistically significant so you 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.819
 See even 16 percent is threatening 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.310
 to raise is for any autograph 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.840
 not relevant for any result 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.720
 That means that should be us already 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.599
 demonstrate 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.099
 for those who always ask themselves more often 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.109
 What is the hormone? 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.209
 Manipulate with nutrition or training 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.690
 or something else even if 16% 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.150
 That's why testosterone is raised 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.590
 statistically not significant that is 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.410
 because the testosterone in the human 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.870
 body is so little compared with 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.930
 something from outside supplied by many 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.630
 that will be 16 for the body and 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.130
 do not make a difference there 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.700
 you have to be so called supra 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.950
 tackle physiological dosages and 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.440
 then maybe you have something but 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.419
 this theme also comes nice greeting 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.930
 to john wall piece and his video 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.470
 channel 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.299
 I will pass on this study 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.250
 definitely hang up testosterone too 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.400
 soon and there will do something about it 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.379
 like I said oliver I can unfortunately 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 not to say anything except that one 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.019
 should think carefully the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.069
 study situation is that he is very weak and 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.139
 mostly when you actually have this 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.129
 revenue recommendation follows me here 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.480
 again has to reject then it is so 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.459
 a monthly pack at 5 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.870
 to 40 euros and it must 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.030
 of course it is me thinking 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.690
 the value over one euro per day for it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.690
 output
