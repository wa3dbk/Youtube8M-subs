tailgates<00:01:50.560> awesome

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.150 

the<00:01:56.580> bed's<00:01:57.080> solid<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.230> it's<00:01:58.410> beat<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160

miles<00:02:15.769> that<00:02:16.769> one<00:02:16.950> there<00:02:17.099> gets<00:02:17.280> about<00:02:17.549> eight

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
miles that one there gets about eight

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.910 
miles that one there gets about eight
miles<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.150> gallon<00:02:18.180> pulling<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.840> camper<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.440> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
miles a gallon pulling that camper so I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
miles a gallon pulling that camper so I
should<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.370> able<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.760> accomplish<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:22.310> stay

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
should be able to accomplish it stay
