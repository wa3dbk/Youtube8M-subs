because that's actually the driver that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
because that's actually the driver that
is<00:01:35.310> gonna<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.060> whole<00:01:36.329> gear<00:01:36.780> work

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is gonna make this this whole gear work

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499
