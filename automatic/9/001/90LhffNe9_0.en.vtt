 the first impression 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.660
 and we want to let it less today 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.740
 That's exactly what we want to use the first impression 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.280
 we decided on the first impression for the device Thun thousand 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.320

 Pauli connection Garth connection 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.950
 and 12 the monkeys Zion 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 including the June Cable so all the features of the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.469
 if consumer needs or could need 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 the future 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.079
 to be prepared 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.249
 it's called here in your Fowler 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.669
 Percent satellite receiver with percent 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.949
 get the USB 2 points 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.259
 I need that there 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.159
 this second 0, they basically need percent on every one he quit 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.769
 Müsli's decoder 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.629
 Hard disk recording and Broder can also play jay-tech files 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.849
 and so on 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.629
 Bastürk costs this device 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.329
 the tent will be percent off 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.639
 the first 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.189
 May say about three days ago 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.219
 yes in the trade 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.869
 479 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.939
 Euro available 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.329
 that's already my next question as it is now with the ANGA Cable too 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.719
 come directly to the market 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.639
 It will be delivered in the next few days 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.720
 us in because on the Rhine then we also have our copybook or 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.189
 that just produced 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.619
 and I think we'll have the real change next 10 to 15 days 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.169
 and the alleged price we were with 779 until the 8th 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.879
 that is unfortunately so that monument of 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.489
 the force-percent through the volcano 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.379
 a lot of logistical costs we had naturally serves the development of 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.289
 modern dr of the divisions of where it then on euro 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.690
 but such things must be safe for us 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.390
 and to put that people have to start saving from 79 to 99 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.019
 We do not know what we want to do 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.119
 we will see it we will hear that we will know 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.249
 Revised even more devices led a whole product family 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.730
 but what else for me in the portfolio 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.170
 you will also find here and his flour next baby that is no different 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.699
 again heal Plus in many variants so say recording takes 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.389
 Percent independently 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.399
 we also have our own LCD build 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.959
 + 0 Zietlows he stands for future security and 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.379
 Fürth innovations 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.659
 with the meaning of 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.709
 whether Freter's versatility and flexibility 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.670

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.149
 Entega union group to be able to connect 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:07.439
 or the ovens 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.539
 and since it is so price structure 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.779
 there we will certainly be between 2 99 and 99 Trauner the picture on it 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.719
 at what the end user abundance hard drive 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.719
 Galler handle that certainly differently equipped up to a terabyte 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.120

 Speaking of PSD Bank and the offenders punished is also colored 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.539
 these tests become percent 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.870
 just 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.590
 Heise rolls baked and SuS is still in development are percent 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.860
 I think middle there 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.360
 Done in 2010 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.620
 and I think we will sink 4 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.600
 the last question to the Premium Line what understands everything so line accommodate 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.599
