pot orchids we're going to use a cat lay
as<00:00:11.980> an<00:00:12.190> example<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:13.209> others<00:00:13.629> are<00:00:13.900> pretty

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
as an example the others are pretty

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.740 
as an example the others are pretty
similar<00:00:14.760> what<00:00:15.760> this<00:00:15.939> will<00:00:16.150> apply<00:00:16.390> especially

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
similar what this will apply especially

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.670 
similar what this will apply especially
to<00:00:17.140> cat<00:00:17.350> lay<00:00:17.560> is<00:00:17.820> why<00:00:18.820> do<00:00:18.880> we<00:00:19.119> pot<00:00:19.330> orchids<00:00:19.840> well

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
to cat lay is why do we pot orchids well

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.249 
to cat lay is why do we pot orchids well
because<00:00:21.249> what<00:00:22.060> they're<00:00:22.240> growing<00:00:22.390> in<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:23.079> not

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
because what they're growing in is not

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.909 
because what they're growing in is not
giving<00:00:23.740> them<00:00:23.919> the<00:00:24.159> best<00:00:24.369> growth<00:00:25.409> it<00:00:26.409> might<00:00:26.679> be

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
giving them the best growth it might be

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.870 
giving them the best growth it might be
that<00:00:27.159> it's<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:29.050> under<00:00:29.919> potted<00:00:30.579> where<00:00:30.759> this

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
that it's way under potted where this

once<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.790> year<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:53.350> assuming<00:00:53.860> we<00:00:54.250> actually

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
once a year that's assuming we actually

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
get enough time to do it every year so

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.070 
get enough time to do it every year so
we're<00:00:57.670> going<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> take<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.240> pot<00:00:58.450> through<00:00:58.960> the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
we're going to take the pot through the

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.310 
we're going to take the pot through the
plant<00:00:59.320> out<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.740> pot<00:01:00.930> we're<00:01:01.930> gonna<00:01:01.990> try

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
plant out of the pot we're gonna try

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.009 
plant out of the pot we're gonna try
just<00:01:02.650> to<00:01:02.860> pull<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.310> out<00:01:03.460> because<00:01:03.940> there<00:01:04.900> are

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
just to pull it out because there are

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.390 
just to pull it out because there are
roots<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.470> bottom<00:01:05.799> they're<00:01:05.950> gonna<00:01:06.070> be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
roots in the bottom they're gonna be

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.440 
roots in the bottom they're gonna be
lost<00:01:06.670> anyway

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
lost anyway

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.060

there<00:01:07.720> we<00:01:07.900> go<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.880> inside<00:01:10.750> was<00:01:11.560> almost

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
there we go now inside was almost

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.899 
there we go now inside was almost
straight<00:01:12.460> bark<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.650> grow<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.340> mix<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.850> has

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
straight bark we grow in a mix that has

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
straight bark we grow in a mix that has
a<00:01:16.180> lot<00:01:16.480> of<00:01:16.630> other<00:01:16.780> things<00:01:17.140> in<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.500> we<00:01:18.130> have

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
a lot of other things in it we have

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.469 
a lot of other things in it we have
charcoal<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.510> we<00:01:19.990> have<00:01:20.970> sponge<00:01:21.970> rock<00:01:22.240> which

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
charcoal and we have sponge rock which

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.950 
charcoal and we have sponge rock which
is<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.690> white<00:01:23.050> big<00:01:23.830> giant<00:01:24.370> perlite<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.870> have

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
is a white big giant perlite and we have

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.890 
is a white big giant perlite and we have
a<00:01:26.080> low<00:01:26.140> floor<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.800> those<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.909> organics<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
a low floor and those in organics the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.140 
a low floor and those in organics the
sponge<00:01:29.409> Rock<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.950> low<00:01:30.100> floor<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
sponge Rock the a low floor and the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.800 
sponge Rock the a low floor and the
charcoal<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.600> degrade<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.170> turn<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.620> mush

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
charcoal do not degrade and turn to mush

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.660 
charcoal do not degrade and turn to mush
so<00:01:37.810> that's<00:01:38.049> why<00:01:38.260> they're<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.799> mix

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
so that's why they're in the mix

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.330 
so that's why they're in the mix
so<00:01:41.240> now<00:01:41.540> we've<00:01:42.050> removed<00:01:42.350> everything<00:01:42.979> off<00:01:43.310> of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
so now we've removed everything off of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.750 
so now we've removed everything off of
the<00:01:43.520> roots<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:44.150> we<00:01:44.390> think<00:01:44.659> will<00:01:44.810> rot<00:01:45.760> and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
the roots that we think will rot and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.460 
the roots that we think will rot and
we're<00:01:46.940> ready<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.210> put<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.690> into<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.960> new<00:01:48.200> pot

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
we're ready to put it into a new pot

front of the plant is already growing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.350 
front of the plant is already growing
out<00:02:54.799> so<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.160> really<00:02:55.400> needs<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.970> next<00:02:56.120> size<00:02:56.420> pot

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

out so it really needs the next size pot
next<00:02:59.360> size<00:02:59.510> pot<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> five<00:03:00.530> inch<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.670> an

next size pot is a five inch this is an

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.410 
next size pot is a five inch this is an

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
azalea that's the short pot really

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.449 
azalea that's the short pot really
wasn't<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.750> lot<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:06.019> roots<00:03:06.350> on<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.100> short

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
wasn't a lot of roots on here so a short

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.390 
wasn't a lot of roots on here so a short
pot<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.910> probably<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.299> good<00:03:08.480> idea<00:03:09.130> we'll<00:03:10.130> set

some<00:03:35.860> people<00:03:36.280> would<00:03:36.490> put<00:03:37.380> broken<00:03:38.380> pot<00:03:38.700> pieces
