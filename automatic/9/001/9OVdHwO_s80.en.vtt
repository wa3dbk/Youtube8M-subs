00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 dress the right way in a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.190
 Job interview is almost as 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
 important as the curriculum or our 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 preparation a bad image before the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.380
 interviewer in the shadow of our 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.920
 qualities and abilities reflected 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.920
 on paper 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.020
 to 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.259
 my name is soldevila bordona consolation and 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.990
 I am 26 years old, the three pieces have 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.269
 missing in my closet are jeans 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.460
 basic t-shirts and scarves of colors and 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.620
 now I am in in several processes of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 selection to find work that I 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.699
 I would like a little bit to help me 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.409
 When not introduce interviews 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.480
 because as my style is quite casual 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.710
 Well, sometimes I'm a little lost 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 in all this it is important that I 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.320
 feel comfortable 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
 and is now a bit I'll let get 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.050
 and what I need is that vÃ©lez threw me 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.050
 a hand in that direction 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.180
 consolation is doing 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.800
 job interviews and accept the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 appropriate wardrobe sometimes 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.160
 generates doubts and insecurity 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.990
 Job interview is a situation 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.480
 formally this does not have to imply 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 necessarily a suit a set of 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.500
 blazer jacket with skirt or trousers 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.980
 combined in harmonious colors is very 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980
 Right 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 consolation this is a safe slope 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.509
 white shirt black jacket black is 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.130
 a color that conveys seriousness and there 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.080
 to be careful with him if you want 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.790
 create an open communication channel and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.190
 dynamic that's why we always go to 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.170
 combine it with a top in one more tone 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.909
 clear close to the face despite being of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.799
 braces is not going to see because it goes with the 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.350
 jacket and well it does not have the cut 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.600
 classic of a shirt has a detail 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.420
 a little approached in the neck but very 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.630
 simple and very appropriate to maintain 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.399
 that look very clean serious and flattering 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.130
 comfort in the alternative to the blazer 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.140
 black is the white blazer we're going to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.599
 combine a black pants with top 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.370
 white and white blazer we got 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.130
 putting all white on the part 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.500
 superior transmitting a very image 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 clean and very transparent 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.370
 the navy blue or the black should be 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.990
 combine with neutral colors since the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.790
 neutral do not affect in any way 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.340
 the emotions and harmonize the others 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.380
 colors my advice if you combine it with 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.670
 other colors choose the range of tones 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.670
 very soft cake 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 we have created a look based on two 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.239
 neutral colors in this case we have 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.610
 used two different shades of blue and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.010
 white navy blue pants more 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.599
 basics with the detail that is a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.030
 Capri pants more appropriate for 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.040
 spring-summer season and not for that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 it takes away formality especially for a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.000
 young girl as consolation instead of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.970
 take a basic blazer we have opted for 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.159
 a pique jacket in a blue tone a 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.720
 little medium makes a nice contrast with 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.849
 the navy blue and in addition to that 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.640
 difference of textures is very 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.040
 interesting also to rejuvenate a 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.709
 so formal look the white shirt has 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.569
 some details in silver tones that good 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.730
 they are very discreet and I am already comforting 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.920
 feel very good the bag has been a bit 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 the most personal detail for her because 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.420
 it takes away a bit of formality and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.739
 seriousness that goes very 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.549
 suitable for a job interview 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.480
 I feel comfortable and from the beginning 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.480
 connected with me 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 there is not a second chance for a 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.829
 first impression and first impression 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.989
 my advice is decisive in a 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.030
 Job interview avoids necklines 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.030
 pronounced garments too short 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.340
 tight clothing excessive transparencies 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.870
 complements or makeup opts for a 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.609
 simple hairstyle a bag size 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.359
 medium small and some heeled shoes 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.359
 closed 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 two 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.610
 this proposal is much more discreet 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.340
 much more formal and much more to the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.990
 sure we have used tissues that in 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.790
 theory are not as formal as the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.540
 cotton we have used a dress 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.060
 blue in cotton combined with silk and a 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.710
 white blazer with elastane with which 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.210
 consolation is very comfortable now in my 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.160
 next interview I do not have to 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.880
 worry about what I wear but only 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.880
 for my curriculum 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.680
 suddenly seen that I can live modern 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.750
 and it 's comfortable and with an informal touch 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.490
 which is what I like and I only 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.560
 is to wish you all good luck in 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.720
 your job interviews remember 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.890
 the image is important so it 's 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.890
 take care of her thank you
