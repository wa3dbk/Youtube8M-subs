 food today we cook salad with you 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.840
 fried crab sticks 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.300
 for me personally, this salad was a discovery 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160
 the last time one of the most 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.270
 interesting salads that I do 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.580
 tried so let's get started for 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.780
 cooking salad we need 200 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.760
 2 grams of mushrooms boiled carrots and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.239
 200 grams of crab sticks but I took 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.850
 crab meat one onion and olive 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.370
 oil for refueling proceed blanks 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.219
 onion cut into half rings crab 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.790
 chopsticks sticks carrot rub on 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.739
 large grater and mushrooms and cut 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.230
 I didn't immediately have plates 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.190
 sliced and because in the freezer I 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.649
 I keep the blanks and then take turns 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.390
 fry mushrooms 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.670
 to golden crust onion to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 golden brown and sticks up 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.390
 golden brown 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.259
 when roasting all a little bit and they sat down 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.710
 Do the barrels still peppered a little if 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.570
 roasting you used butter then i don't 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 I recommend nothing more to spice up 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.869
 well enough if it is fried on 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 so let's say dry and then you can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.360
 add some olive oil and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.539
 actually combine the ingredients i 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.509
 put salad on layers 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.789
 carrot onion mushrooms and squid on top 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.800
 but if you want it and it is quite possible 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.670
 mix from it its flavoring 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.350
 qualities a little worse will not be so 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.190
 you know it happened in my life that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.470

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.409

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.960
