00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.400
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.480
 we are here with the suzuki in blue is a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.220
 new model that is presented 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.580
 or rather it was presented to colony 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.580
 gave suffered interesting pattern 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.699
 twin-cylinder engine is 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.329
 practically new inline twin 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.239
 liquid cooled double shaft six gears 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.710
 well equipped to the aesthetic reminds 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.140
 that of viking destined to a qb 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 non-specialist ie not to those who seek 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.810
 sportiness in the bike with practicality 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.760
 there are those who talk about destination women 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.970
 I don't really like talking about 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.770
 destination woman destination man 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.190
 oh well dishes instead talk about ease 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.400
 or practicality of a vehicle is also 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.550
 true that sometimes 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.820
 for how we live in a society 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.860
 chauvinist to them sometimes we say there 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.410
 You want a simple or easy bike 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.570
 for a woman I disagree is one 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.810
 good entry level can go very well 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.780
 for a boy of this age who must 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.660
 get closer to the world of motorcycles and then 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.210
 as before as first as first access 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.050
 may be interesting i would like to know 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.300
 very well 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.950
 or for a woman maybe a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.310
 little bit older 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.650
 but for a woman right now 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.360
 is in great embarrassment to be 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.360
 here with us but in reality she and the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.130
 our tester of the day we make one 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.070
 This year's motorcycle overview we start 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.400
 from the front then the lighthouse really is 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.200
 interesting a different dimension not 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 is the usual round and true lighthouse file 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.780
 recalls the aesthetics of viking the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.030
 fender and an important fender a 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.479
 my opinion too much in my opinion 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.479
 staff 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 let's look at the dumbbell seeds and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.800
 not of handlebar brake lever 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.459
 adjustable of excellent invoice lever of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.530
 clutch 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.650
 usually the usual regulation of the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.730
 clutch to child that we have on all 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.470
 the equipment the blocks are 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.989
 however of good finish beautiful i 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.390
 mirrors 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.320
 we can see the braking system 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.930
 here there is a single disk, insettino 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.320
 facing high quality missing 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.730
 we can see that it has one 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.040
 truly outstanding instrumentation 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.330
 we have our turkeys ours 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.330
 tachometer we have the speed on 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.849
 the petrol indicator 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.120
 we're the guys too 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.140
 talking about an economic 250 entry level 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.140
 we meet 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.400
 we pass the saddle to a good saddle 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.970
 padding but I would like to do it to see 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:22.160
 because this is really important 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.310
 investiture in the case of pilots not 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.700
 too high they can easily work 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.319
 on the saddle by digging lightly 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.360
 we have no saddle underneath 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.060
 lots of space though a little bit yes 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.400
 can get in this area you have that is 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.440
 just provided a housing for a 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.640
 padlock maybe a padlock to a 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.349
 something like this 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.180
 from here we can see the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.730
 monoshock which is adjustable 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.250
 we even have seven positions of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.560
 adjustment for the single shock absorber 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.819
 obviously in the preload of his wife e 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.609
 of pasca access equipment of the 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.560
 tools and we really are 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:05.480
 making this shot close to 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.859
 departure of seaplanes on the lake of 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.090
 como 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.940
 I would say that the landscape and the setting 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.700
 suggestive we also said the equipment 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.269
 the tools died well invoice 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.269
 full 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.800
 we pass to the rear we can see a 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.100
 part as we covered the saddle that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.900
 the arrows are rather rudimentary 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.780
 breccias yes it is true they are important arrows 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.030
 but they are quite particular arrows 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.810
 so with the white mirror anyway 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.680
 nice to see the pintail is a lot 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.680
 important 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.310
 the dimensions are there aesthetics can 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.810
 also be questionable though 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.170
 we consider the also in the context of the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.490
 practicality the drains are always two 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.040
 recalling the Viking 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.660
 in my opinion, even here too much 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.910
 you could probably save yourself a 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.880
 little bit on the drains putting it there 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.320
 just one and maybe spend more I don't know 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.580
 in the braking system or in others 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.130
 elements however this is the use 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.970
 staff I also like to lean into 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.890
 possession of books but those who are good 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.960
 selection however we have a 140 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.190
 rear a 110 at the front we hold 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.440
 always mind that we are talking about 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:25.400
 a 250 twin so I'm more than that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.670
 proportionate the bike in my opinion is 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.320
 however fairly manageable I say 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.890
 strictly because in my opinion in 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.820
 this project was the favorite one 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.820
 stability to handling 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.169
 it is not a big bike 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.449
 acceleration of high performance 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.099
 but a bike that also allows us 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.399
 public to make enough trips 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:53.839
 long long in comfort and without 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:56.599
 to undermine professor alessio 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:06:00.499
 I would like to pass the word repeats again 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:04.069
 at the tester of the day there is a woman 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:05.449
 anna also called flea because it is small 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.649
 of stature 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.599
 so I would also like to show I would like 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:14.469
 also show what they can 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.839
 be the strengths and weaknesses 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:20.479
 proportionately it has a physique 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:22.930
 not of great performance but of 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.930
 great will
