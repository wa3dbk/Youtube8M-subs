most<00:00:56.100> people<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> idea<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.760> maybe<00:00:56.910> look

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
most people have the idea of maybe look

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
most people have the idea of maybe look
at<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> Apollo<00:00:57.510> era<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.989> even<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> shuttle

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
at the Apollo era or even the shuttle

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.299 
at the Apollo era or even the shuttle
and<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.579> 80s<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.530> JPL<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> a

scientist<00:01:44.210> well<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.990> started

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
scientist well for me it kind of started

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
scientist well for me it kind of started
with<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> love<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.340> understanding<00:01:47.729> how

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
with a love of just understanding how

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.060 
with a love of just understanding how
the<00:01:47.880> world<00:01:48.060> works<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.860> with

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the world works it's kind of like with

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.330 
the world works it's kind of like with
like<00:01:50.400> physics<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.070> being

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
like physics and then it was just being

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.679 
like physics and then it was just being
inspired<00:01:53.640> i<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
inspired i think with the thing that

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.620 
inspired i think with the thing that
really<00:01:54.990> inspired<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.650> most<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.920> actually

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
really inspired me the most was actually

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.770 
really inspired me the most was actually
7<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:58.130> jet<00:01:58.310> pulse<00:01:58.490> when<00:01:58.640> i<00:01:58.670> landed<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.180> very

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
7 the jet pulse when i landed a very

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.910 
7 the jet pulse when i landed a very
small<00:02:00.280> microwave<00:02:01.280> kind<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.149> size<00:02:02.360> car<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:03.560> Mars

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
small microwave kind of size car on Mars

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.039 
small microwave kind of size car on Mars
and<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.909> July<00:02:05.149> fourth<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.570> course<00:02:05.750> was<00:02:05.960> like

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
and the July fourth of course was like

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.169 
and the July fourth of course was like
to<00:02:06.140> pick<00:02:06.289> these<00:02:06.409> great<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.070> days<00:02:08.000> to

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
to pick these great to you know days to

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.779 
to pick these great to you know days to
do<00:02:08.300> things<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.979> saw<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.610> was<00:02:10.700> just

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
do things on and I saw that it was just

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.880 
do things on and I saw that it was just
it<00:02:11.030> was<00:02:11.300> great<00:02:11.540> because<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:12.769> think

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it was great because you know I think

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.350 
it was great because you know I think
you<00:02:13.069> look<00:02:13.160> at<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.489> missions<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> go<00:02:14.300> to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you look at the missions that go to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.210 
you look at the missions that go to
another<00:02:14.540> place<00:02:14.720> there's<00:02:15.080> no<00:02:15.290> context<00:02:16.069> it's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
another place there's no context it's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.680 
another place there's no context it's
just<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> beautiful<00:02:17.030> landscape<00:02:17.390> or<00:02:17.599> it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
just it's a beautiful landscape or it's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
just it's a beautiful landscape or it's
a<00:02:17.750> shot<00:02:17.930> from<00:02:18.050> above<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.410> don't<00:02:18.560> see<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
a shot from above you don't see the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.680 
a shot from above you don't see the
human<00:02:19.760> element<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.150> space<00:02:20.330> craft<00:02:20.510> have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
human element the space craft have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.809 
human element the space craft have
actually<00:02:20.780> built<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:22.069> then<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.459> see<00:02:22.640> this

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
actually built but then you can see this

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.250 
actually built but then you can see this
little<00:02:22.970> rover<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.450> Mars<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.959> was<00:02:24.050> like<00:02:24.140> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
little rover on Mars and I was like this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.140 
little rover on Mars and I was like this
is<00:02:24.319> something<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.860> humans<00:02:25.160> work<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.000> is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
is something that humans work on this is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.470 
is something that humans work on this is
a<00:02:26.180> real<00:02:26.810> job<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:28.790> that's<00:02:29.180> kind<00:02:29.450> of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
a real job and that's that's kind of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.130 
a real job and that's that's kind of
what<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.720> hooked<00:02:29.989> we<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.709> video<00:02:31.160> of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
what I was hooked we have a video of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.170 
what I was hooked we have a video of
recreation<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.380> landing<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.310> curiosity<00:02:35.120> I

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
recreation of the landing of curiosity I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.339 
recreation of the landing of curiosity I
was<00:02:35.299> thinking<00:02:35.540> maybe<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.930> watch<00:02:36.080> that

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
was thinking maybe we can watch that

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.809 
was thinking maybe we can watch that
together<00:02:36.530> okay<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.580> kind<00:02:37.700> of

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
together okay and you can kind of

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.120 
together okay and you can kind of
explained<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:38.630> everything<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.920> right

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
explained what everything that the right

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.009 
explained what everything that the right
this<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> gather<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.299> where<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:41.989> enter

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
this is a gather this is where we enter

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.289 
this is a gather this is where we enter
the<00:02:42.470> atmosphere<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:43.069> Mars<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.849> when<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
the atmosphere of Mars so when the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.180 
the atmosphere of Mars so when the
amazing<00:02:44.569> things<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:44.900> Mars<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.410> 14<00:02:45.890> minutes

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
amazing things as Mars it's 14 minutes

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.880 
amazing things as Mars it's 14 minutes
away<00:02:46.340> at<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.940> speed<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.510> light<00:02:47.540> from<00:02:47.930> us<00:02:48.140> so

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
away at the speed of light from us so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.620 
away at the speed of light from us so
we're<00:02:49.250> getting<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.670> signal<00:02:50.060> 14<00:02:50.450> minutes

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
we're getting this signal 14 minutes

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.569 
we're getting this signal 14 minutes
after<00:02:50.870> actually<00:02:51.140> happened<00:02:51.470> ok<00:02:51.829> so<00:02:52.459> we're

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
after actually happened ok so we're

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.850

entering around 13,000 miles an hour we

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.370 
entering around 13,000 miles an hour we
slow<00:02:55.130> down<00:02:55.340> enough<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.360> use<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.959> supersonic

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
slow down enough to use a supersonic

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.650 
slow down enough to use a supersonic
parachute<00:02:57.620> which<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> largest<00:02:58.660> fastens

apartments<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.620> front<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.269> descent

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
apartments on the front of the descent

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.240 
apartments on the front of the descent
stage<00:03:20.299> there<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.859> looking<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
stage there so it's looking for the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.370 
stage there so it's looking for the
ground<00:03:22.430> looking<00:03:22.790> for<00:03:22.970> vertical<00:03:23.359> distance<00:03:24.170> and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
ground looking for vertical distance and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.229 
ground looking for vertical distance and
velocity<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.220> horizontal<00:03:25.670> Ozzie<00:03:25.880> some<00:03:26.030> kind

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
velocity and horizontal Ozzie some kind

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.059 
velocity and horizontal Ozzie some kind
of<00:03:26.269> straighten<00:03:26.750> out<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.290> fuse<00:03:27.500> next<00:03:27.889> part

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
of straighten out the fuse next part

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.470 
of straighten out the fuse next part
here<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.370> watch<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.700> stronger<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> strings

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
here the watch is stronger the strings

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.240 
here the watch is stronger the strings
this<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> part<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.470> these<00:03:30.650> strings<00:03:30.950> what

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
this is the part of these strings what

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.490 
this is the part of these strings what
is<00:03:31.370> us<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.880> say<00:03:32.090> it's<00:03:32.329> basically<00:03:32.690> rope<00:03:32.959> yeah

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
is us and say it's basically rope yeah

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.349 
is us and say it's basically rope yeah
it's<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.220> nylon<00:03:34.370> rope<00:03:34.670> point<00:03:34.940> you're<00:03:35.090> watching

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
it's a nylon rope point you're watching

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.849 
it's a nylon rope point you're watching
this<00:03:35.420> drew<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.870> our<00:03:36.019> assuming<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.769> our

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
this drew this is our assuming in our

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.930 
this drew this is our assuming in our
camera<00:03:37.220> yeah<00:03:38.739> that's<00:03:39.739> actual<00:03:40.130> footage<00:03:40.340> this

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
camera yeah that's actual footage this

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.280 
camera yeah that's actual footage this
is<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.150> actual<00:03:41.299> face<00:03:41.600> always<00:03:41.780> actually<00:03:42.200> that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
is the actual face always actually that

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.690 
is the actual face always actually that
footage<00:03:42.530> from<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.709> camera<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.370> so

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
footage from that camera this is so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.960 
footage from that camera this is so
simulation<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.750> about<00:03:45.440> 50<00:03:46.280> 100<00:03:46.579> years<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.850> off

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
simulation so about 50 100 years of off

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.069 
simulation so about 50 100 years of off
the<00:03:47.090> ground<00:03:47.299> we<00:03:47.420> started<00:03:47.720> on<00:03:47.810> during<00:03:47.959> this

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
the ground we started on during this

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.830 
the ground we started on during this
phase<00:03:48.530> wow<00:03:48.889> this<00:03:49.280> like<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.150> zoo<00:03:50.420> TV<00:03:50.690> tour

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
phase wow this like a you to zoo TV tour

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.520 
phase wow this like a you to zoo TV tour
it's<00:03:51.680> basically

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
it's basically

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.550 
it's basically
station<00:03:55.420> alright<00:03:56.769> so<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.629> lowers<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.349> on

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
station alright so so it lowers it on

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.990 
station alright so so it lowers it on
these<00:04:01.099> ropes<00:04:01.640> until<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.450> softly<00:04:02.810> touches<00:04:03.230> down

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
these ropes until it softly touches down

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.430 
these ropes until it softly touches down
and<00:04:05.000> once<00:04:05.209> we<00:04:05.390> detect<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:05.870> touchdown<00:04:06.110> over

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
and once we detect this touchdown over

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.500 
and once we detect this touchdown over
the<00:04:06.620> top<00:04:06.799> part<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.190> cut<00:04:07.400> away<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.940> flies<00:04:08.299> off

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the top part is cut away and flies off

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.990 
the top part is cut away and flies off
the<00:04:08.690> crash<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.260> safely<00:04:10.040> elsewhere<00:04:10.760> on<00:04:10.819> Mars

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
the crash and safely elsewhere on Mars

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.580 
the crash and safely elsewhere on Mars
away<00:04:11.180> from<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.420> rover<00:04:11.659> is<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.870> key<00:04:12.019> don't<00:04:12.500> go

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
away from the rover is the key don't go

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.680 
away from the rover is the key don't go
crunch<00:04:12.829> on<00:04:13.040> Mars<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.400> feel<00:04:13.970> fresh<00:04:14.209> no<00:04:14.540> no

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
crunch on Mars I feel fresh no no

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.150 
crunch on Mars I feel fresh no no
absolutely<00:04:15.230> there's<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:15.829> mean<00:04:15.860> we<00:04:16.040> have

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
absolutely there's I mean we have

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.770 
absolutely there's I mean we have
pictures<00:04:16.489> after<00:04:16.729> words<00:04:17.120> from<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.359> orbital

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
pictures after words from the orbital

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.050 
pictures after words from the orbital
images<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:18.680> where<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.100> crash<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.639> you<00:04:19.669> can<00:04:19.820> see

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
images of where it crash and you can see

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.330 
images of where it crash and you can see
this<00:04:20.329> like<00:04:20.510> big<00:04:20.660> splat<00:04:21.049> on<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.410> ground<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:22.130> how

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
this like big splat on the ground so how

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.950 
this like big splat on the ground so how
is<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.669> that<00:04:22.699> that<00:04:22.940> somebody<00:04:23.300> comes<00:04:23.570> up<00:04:23.750> with

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
is it that that somebody comes up with

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.290 
is it that that somebody comes up with
that<00:04:24.199> look<00:04:24.590> how<00:04:25.340> they<00:04:25.550> come<00:04:25.699> up<00:04:25.820> with<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.120> I

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
that look how they come up with that I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.420 
that look how they come up with that I
mean<00:04:26.539> there<00:04:26.630> must<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.780> been<00:04:26.900> other<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.410> lot<00:04:28.310> of

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
mean there must have been other a lot of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.180 
mean there must have been other a lot of
interest<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:28.970> we<00:04:29.090> had<00:04:29.210> done<00:04:29.510> air<00:04:29.690> bags<00:04:29.900> before

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
interest and we had done air bags before

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.529 
interest and we had done air bags before
we've<00:04:31.190> done<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.669> Rockets<00:04:32.030> on<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.240> bottom

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
we've done the Rockets on the bottom

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.270 
we've done the Rockets on the bottom
thing<00:04:32.810> with<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.199> pallet<00:04:33.800> letters<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.130> still

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
thing with the pallet letters and still

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.680 
thing with the pallet letters and still
do<00:04:34.400> Rockets<00:04:34.699> on<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.850> bottom<00:04:35.090> with<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.510> lot<00:04:35.660> of

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
do Rockets on the bottom with a lot of

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.080 
do Rockets on the bottom with a lot of
the<00:04:35.780> pallet<00:04:36.020> lenders<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:37.580> was<00:04:37.789> really<00:04:37.970> a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
the pallet lenders and this was really a

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.990 
the pallet lenders and this was really a
group<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.360> people<00:04:38.630> sat<00:04:38.930> in<00:04:39.169> a<00:04:39.289> room<00:04:39.320> they<00:04:39.860> had

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
group of people sat in a room they had

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.580 
group of people sat in a room they had
brainstorming<00:04:41.000> day<00:04:41.289> they<00:04:42.289> looked<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
brainstorming day they looked it

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.779 
brainstorming day they looked it
differently<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.280> know<00:04:43.340> they<00:04:43.430> looked<00:04:43.610> again

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
differently I you know they looked again

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.730 
differently I you know they looked again
at<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.000> old<00:04:44.150> ideas<00:04:44.419> they<00:04:44.630> add<00:04:44.900> some<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.620> was

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
at the old ideas they add some this was

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.379 
at the old ideas they add some this was
kind<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:45.949> a<00:04:46.039> very<00:04:46.190> elegant<00:04:46.370> solution<00:04:46.940> because

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
kind of a very elegant solution because

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.730 
kind of a very elegant solution because
it's<00:04:47.780> sort<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:47.990> mathematically<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
it's sort of mathematically like a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.529 
it's sort of mathematically like a
pendulum<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.910> want<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.300> first

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
pendulum I just want to like the first

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.540 
pendulum I just want to like the first
you<00:04:51.410> know<00:04:51.500> physics<00:04:51.860> equations<00:04:52.039> that<00:04:52.400> you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
you know physics equations that you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.770 
you know physics equations that you
learn<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:54.350> so<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.580> relatively<00:04:56.270> easy

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
learn and so it's a relatively easy

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.629 
learn and so it's a relatively easy
problem<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.530> make<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.039> lends<00:04:58.250> itself<00:04:58.550> very

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
problem and it make it lends itself very

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.760 
problem and it make it lends itself very
well<00:04:58.880> for<00:04:59.210> simulation<00:04:59.750> and<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.289> in<00:05:00.410> fact<00:05:00.560> all

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
well for simulation and so in fact all

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.890 
well for simulation and so in fact all
that<00:05:00.950> we<00:05:01.039> saw<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:02.300> were<00:05:02.330> never<00:05:02.570> able<00:05:02.750> to

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
that we saw we were never able to

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.170 
that we saw we were never able to
recreate<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.620> earth<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.820> we<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.090> to

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
recreate that on earth so we have to

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.670 
recreate that on earth so we have to
simulate<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.690> so<00:05:05.810> there's<00:05:05.990> bits<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:06.380> pieces

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
simulate it so there's bits and pieces

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.900 
simulate it so there's bits and pieces
that<00:05:06.800> are<00:05:06.889> tested<00:05:07.280> here<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.580> there<00:05:07.729> but

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
that are tested here and there but

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.400 
that are tested here and there but
ultimately<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.750> first<00:05:08.900> time<00:05:09.050> ever<00:05:09.200> came

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
ultimately the first time ever came

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.170 
ultimately the first time ever came
together<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.830> was<00:05:10.190> on<00:05:10.340> Mars<00:05:10.550> so<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.030> go

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
together it was on Mars so you go

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.029 
together it was on Mars so you go
through<00:05:11.360> all<00:05:11.479> those<00:05:11.870> steps<00:05:12.139> this<00:05:12.800> being

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
through all those steps this being

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.610 
through all those steps this being
broadcast<00:05:13.610> live<00:05:13.910> around<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.539> world<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:15.380> guys

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620

because<00:05:20.960> do<00:05:21.080> you<00:05:21.110> probably<00:05:21.770> there's<00:05:21.919> a<00:05:21.979> lot<00:05:22.130> of

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
because do you probably there's a lot of

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.290 
because do you probably there's a lot of
steps<00:05:22.430> along<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.729> way<00:05:22.849> that<00:05:23.060> you're<00:05:23.150> thinking

ten years um but absolutely you know
there's<00:05:37.070> there's<00:05:37.460> but<00:05:38.270> not<00:05:38.449> only<00:05:38.630> is<00:05:38.720> there

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
there's there's but not only is there

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.930 
there's there's but not only is there
the<00:05:39.320> Traverse<00:05:39.919> from<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.550> know<00:05:40.610> but<00:05:40.789> there's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
the Traverse from you know but there's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.520 
the Traverse from you know but there's
getting<00:05:41.270> off<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.510> ground<00:05:41.539> as<00:05:41.990> we<00:05:42.110> saw<00:05:42.260> the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
getting off the ground as we saw the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.930 
getting off the ground as we saw the
other<00:05:42.620> day<00:05:42.680> watching<00:05:42.949> is<00:05:43.310> still<00:05:43.340> not<00:05:43.669> easy

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
other day watching is still not easy

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.750 
other day watching is still not easy
trivial<00:05:44.539> thing<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.840> do<00:05:45.190> there's<00:05:46.190> getting<00:05:46.669> to

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
trivial thing to do there's getting to

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.730 
trivial thing to do there's getting to
Mars<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.630> know<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.900> accuracy<00:05:48.349> that<00:05:48.440> we<00:05:48.500> need

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
Mars you know the accuracy that we need

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.710 
Mars you know the accuracy that we need
then<00:05:48.979> there's<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.520> you<00:05:50.120> know<00:05:50.240> half<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.449> million

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
then there's the you know half a million

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.370 
then there's the you know half a million
lines<00:05:50.960> of

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
lines of

pyrotechnic<00:05:54.980> devices<00:05:55.250> at<00:05:55.490> all<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.850> fire

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
pyrotechnic devices at all have to fire

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.780 
pyrotechnic devices at all have to fire
for<00:05:56.420> that<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:57.560> happen<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:57.920> you<00:05:58.070> know<00:05:58.400> that<00:05:58.700> the

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
for that to happen so you know that the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.910 
for that to happen so you know that the
odds<00:05:58.910> are<00:05:59.120> kind<00:05:59.420> of<00:05:59.570> you<00:06:00.410> know<00:06:00.440> you<00:06:00.590> Tessa

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
odds are kind of you know you Tessa

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.680 
odds are kind of you know you Tessa
turning<00:06:01.220> you<00:06:01.280> can<00:06:01.520> they're<00:06:01.850> still<00:06:02.090> not<00:06:02.300> really

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
turning you can they're still not really

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.160 
turning you can they're still not really
favorable<00:06:03.290> odds<00:06:03.500> no<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:04.640> now<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:05.360> ship<00:06:05.810> the

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
favorable odds no so now the ship the

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.430 
favorable odds no so now the ship the
rover<00:06:06.890> is<00:06:07.120> on<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.270> ground<00:06:08.450> yeah<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.200> you're

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
rover is on the ground yeah and you're

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.750 
rover is on the ground yeah and you're
sitting<00:06:09.680> there<00:06:09.800> y'all<00:06:10.130> sitting<00:06:10.430> there<00:06:10.550> and

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
sitting there y'all sitting there and

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.700 
sitting there y'all sitting there and
then<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.450> then<00:06:11.930> immerse<00:06:12.110> we<00:06:12.260> cried<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.500> lot

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
then and then immerse we cried a lot

then and then immerse we cried a lot
there's<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.670> lot<00:06:13.790> of<00:06:13.820> hugging<00:06:14.000> things<00:06:14.840> like

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
there's a lot of hugging things like

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.350 
there's a lot of hugging things like
that<00:06:15.170> about<00:06:15.380> celebrating<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.730> then<00:06:17.060> yeah

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
then we got to business so you start

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.430 
then we got to business so you start
driving<00:06:20.030> around<00:06:20.270> right<00:06:20.480> away<00:06:20.690> or<00:06:20.900> is<00:06:21.230> it

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
driving around right away or is it

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.050 
driving around right away or is it
basically<00:06:21.800> a<00:06:21.890> week<00:06:22.100> of<00:06:22.190> checkouts<00:06:22.550> we<00:06:22.820> want<00:06:23.000> to

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
basically a week of checkouts we want to

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.490 
basically a week of checkouts we want to
make<00:06:23.180> sure<00:06:23.210> we<00:06:23.390> can<00:06:23.480> survive<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.960> landing<00:06:24.350> the

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
make sure we can survive the landing the

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.560 
make sure we can survive the landing the
one<00:06:24.650> way<00:06:24.980> if<00:06:25.070> you<00:06:25.160> had<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:25.640> install<00:06:25.910> new
