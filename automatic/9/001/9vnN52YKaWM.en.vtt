small round bumps on its face sort of
similar<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.330> might<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
similar to what you might see on a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.760 
similar to what you might see on a
record<00:01:10.680> iya<00:01:10.770> Yuma<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.630> that's<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
record iya Yuma and that's a kind of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
different from the other a cans that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.640 
different from the other a cans that
tend<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.810> smoother<00:01:16.320> skin

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
tend to have smoother skin

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.690 
tend to have smoother skin
I<00:01:17.720> get<00:01:18.720> asked<00:01:19.140> often<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.920> corals<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I get asked often which corals can be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
I get asked often which corals can be
kept<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> close<00:01:21.360> proximity<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.680> another

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
kept in close proximity with one another

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
kept in close proximity with one another
and<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:24.090> course<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.320> loaded

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and of course that's a really loaded

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
and of course that's a really loaded
question<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> million<00:01:26.850> possible<00:01:27.360> answers

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
question with a million possible answers

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.890 
question with a million possible answers
I<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.590> however<00:01:29.280> say<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.390> cans<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I can however say that a cans of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
I can however say that a cans of
different<00:01:31.259> species<00:01:31.530> close<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> another

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
different species close to one another

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.679 
different species close to one another
is<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> mistake<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.729> Lord<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.240> example

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is a mistake and a can Lord for example

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.080 
is a mistake and a can Lord for example
it's<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> fight<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.310> akh<00:01:38.790> inada

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's going to fight with an akh inada

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's going to fight with an akh inada
very<00:01:39.720> aggressively<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.850> happens<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
very aggressively so if one happens to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
very aggressively so if one happens to
fall<00:01:42.750> off<00:01:42.960> its<00:01:43.229> rock<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.799> land<00:01:44.159> face<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
fall off its rock and land face down on

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
fall off its rock and land face down on
the<00:01:45.119> other<00:01:45.500> one<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.799> both<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.549> corals

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the other one or both of those corals

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210 
the other one or both of those corals
may<00:01:48.000> die<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> result<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.680> important<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
may die as a result so it's important to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
may die as a result so it's important to
consider<00:01:50.579> placement<00:01:51.390> when<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.110> both

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
consider placement when you have both

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.240 
consider placement when you have both
varieties<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> same<00:01:53.490> aquarium<00:01:55.009> lately<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
varieties in the same aquarium lately I
came<00:01:56.490> across<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.479> described<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.320> an

acanthastrea<00:01:59.310> Rotonda<00:02:00.180> flora<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
acanthastrea Rotonda flora I will be the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
acanthastrea Rotonda flora I will be the
first<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.670> admit<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.630> very

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
first to admit that I have a very

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
first to admit that I have a very
difficult<00:02:04.229> time<00:02:04.710> telling<00:02:05.219> these<00:02:05.340> apart<00:02:05.759> from

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
difficult time telling these apart from

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.620 
difficult time telling these apart from
an<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.600> etch<00:02:06.750> inada

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
an a can etch inada

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.800 
an a can etch inada
to<00:02:08.020> confuse<00:02:08.410> matters<00:02:08.709> their<00:02:09.550> morphology<00:02:09.849> very

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
to confuse matters their morphology very

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.600 
to confuse matters their morphology very
substantially<00:02:11.680> depending<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.130> where<00:02:12.430> they're

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
substantially depending on where they're

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.780 
substantially depending on where they're
found<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.390> some<00:02:14.200> geographies<00:02:14.890> such<00:02:15.220> as<00:02:15.370> Japan

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
found in some geographies such as Japan

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.300 
found in some geographies such as Japan
in<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.269> Philippines<00:02:16.870> these<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.739> cans<00:02:18.040> look

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
in the Philippines these a cans look

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.580 
in the Philippines these a cans look
much<00:02:18.760> more<00:02:19.090> similar<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.690> chalice<00:02:20.200> coral

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
much more similar to a chalice coral

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.250 
much more similar to a chalice coral
where<00:02:21.370> their<00:02:21.580> polyps<00:02:22.000> are<00:02:22.150> widely<00:02:22.630> spaced<00:02:22.989> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
where their polyps are widely spaced and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
where their polyps are widely spaced and
the<00:02:23.470> coral<00:02:23.830> lights<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.220> kind<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.670> toothed

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the coral lights have kind of a toothed

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.930 
the coral lights have kind of a toothed
appearance<00:02:25.900> yeah<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.370> why<00:02:27.640> but

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
appearance yeah I don't know why but

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.089 
appearance yeah I don't know why but
there<00:02:28.150> are<00:02:28.269> some<00:02:28.569> corals<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.590> h<00:02:29.709> anata

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
there are some corals like the h anata

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.610 
there are some corals like the h anata
and<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.640> rotunda<00:02:31.060> flora<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.110> can't<00:02:32.440> tell

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
and the rotunda flora that I can't tell

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.729 
and the rotunda flora that I can't tell
apart<00:02:32.950> while<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:34.060> others<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.840> an<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.470> can

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
apart while there's others like an a can

practically<00:02:40.150> identical<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.349> can<00:02:41.560> tell

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
practically identical but I can tell

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.190 
practically identical but I can tell
them<00:02:41.890> apart<00:02:41.980> from<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.459> mile<00:02:42.670> away

the next to a cans the bower banky and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.910 
the next to a cans the bower banky and
he'll<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.470> look<00:02:51.430> very<00:02:51.459> similar<00:02:52.590> both<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.830> these

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
heard described is that the faster you

export of corals such as a mon so if you

export of corals such as a mon so if you
do<00:04:00.790> want<00:04:01.120> one<00:04:01.300> of<00:04:01.330> those

these corals so I recommend making some
effort<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.400> try<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.670> target<00:05:11.940> feed<00:05:12.300> them

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120
