00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
form and in a convertible form so this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
form and in a convertible form so this
is<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.380> windows<00:01:08.340> running<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.880> what's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is this is windows running but what's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
is this is windows running but what's
maybe<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.570> interesting<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.799> we

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
maybe more interesting is that if we

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
maybe more interesting is that if we
pick<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> scale

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pick this up and put this on the scale

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.719 
pick this up and put this on the scale
over<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> machine<00:01:16.170> weighs<00:01:16.729> 1.75

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
over here this machine weighs 1.75

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.800 
over here this machine weighs 1.75
pounds<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.290> number<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.689> doesn't<00:01:21.689> even

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pounds and that number is doesn't even

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
pounds and that number is doesn't even
really<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> justice<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really do it justice right because of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
really do it justice right because of
because<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> full-size

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
