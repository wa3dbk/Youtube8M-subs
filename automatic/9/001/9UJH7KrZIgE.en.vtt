on one and I was gonna do before the
sequel<00:00:56.320> first<00:00:56.590> because<00:00:56.890> it<00:00:56.980> sort<00:00:57.160> of<00:00:57.250> holds

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
sequel first because it sort of holds

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.160

like<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.790> special<00:00:58.270> place<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.510> my<00:00:58.660> heart<00:00:58.989> which

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
like a special place in my heart which

I'll get into but I think that after the
sequel<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.840> much<00:01:02.020> more<00:01:02.170> polished<00:01:02.410> game<00:01:02.770> of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950

little<00:02:48.070> quick<00:02:48.520> attack<00:02:48.850> moved<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.660> it's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
little quick attack moved I think it's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.690 
little quick attack moved I think it's
the<00:02:50.080> insta<00:02:50.470> shield<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:50.920> believe<00:02:51.160> many<00:02:51.400> people

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the insta shield I believe many people

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.000 
the insta shield I believe many people
refer<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:53.080> honestly<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.590> didn't

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
refer to it as but honestly I didn't

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.740 
refer to it as but honestly I didn't
even<00:02:54.070> notice<00:02:54.430> at<00:02:54.760> first<00:02:54.790> because<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.480> level

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
even notice at first because the level

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.110 
even notice at first because the level
design<00:02:56.050> isn't<00:02:56.380> formed<00:02:57.130> around<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.640> need<00:02:57.820> for

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
design isn't formed around the need for

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.060 
design isn't formed around the need for
it<00:02:58.240> it's<00:02:58.390> formed<00:02:58.690> around<00:02:58.990> sort<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.560> Sonic<00:02:59.860> 2

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
it it's formed around sort of Sonic 2

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.950 
it it's formed around sort of Sonic 2
ish<00:03:00.250> level<00:03:00.670> design<00:03:00.940> where<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:01.810> need

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
ish level design where you don't need

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.350 
ish level design where you don't need
any<00:03:02.110> extra<00:03:02.500> moves<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:03.250> sonic<00:03:03.580> does<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.240> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
any extra moves but sonic does have the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.540 
any extra moves but sonic does have the
Spin<00:03:04.600> Dash<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:05.110> he<00:03:05.290> should<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.830> he<00:03:06.040> also<00:03:06.220> has

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
Spin Dash as he should and he also has

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.970 
Spin Dash as he should and he also has
the<00:03:07.060> super<00:03:07.720> peel<00:03:08.050> ouch<00:03:08.200> which<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.710> when<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
the super peel ouch which is when you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.890 
the super peel ouch which is when you
press<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.880> jump<00:03:10.090> button<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.750> do

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
press up and the jump button and you do

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.450 
press up and the jump button and you do
the<00:03:11.050> spinny<00:03:11.320> like<00:03:11.530> things<00:03:11.800> but<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.250> game

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
the spinny like things but in this game

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.040 
the spinny like things but in this game
he<00:03:12.610> has<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> slightly<00:03:13.060> different<00:03:13.210> animation<00:03:13.960> he

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
he has a slightly different animation he

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.260 
he has a slightly different animation he
kind<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.290> charges<00:03:14.710> up<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.610> stance<00:03:15.940> sort<00:03:16.210> of

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
kind of charges up in the stance sort of

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.660 
kind of charges up in the stance sort of
like<00:03:16.390> Speedy<00:03:16.750> Gonzales<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.500> way<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.890> I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
like Speedy Gonzales in a way and I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.730 
like Speedy Gonzales in a way and I
think<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.030> both<00:03:19.240> moves<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> Spin<00:03:20.080> Dash<00:03:20.110> and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
think that both moves the Spin Dash and

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.680 
think that both moves the Spin Dash and
the<00:03:21.190> super<00:03:21.459> peel<00:03:21.640> out<00:03:21.820> work<00:03:22.000> beautifully

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
the super peel out work beautifully

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.990 
the super peel out work beautifully
how's<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.650> level<00:03:23.950> design<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.610> pretty<00:03:24.820> damn

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
how's the level design it's pretty damn

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.720 
how's the level design it's pretty damn
good<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.959> kind<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.440> accommodates<00:03:27.160> for<00:03:27.400> Sonic

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
good it kind of accommodates for Sonic

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.310 
good it kind of accommodates for Sonic
slack<00:03:28.000> events<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.420> shields<00:03:28.720> as<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.930> said<00:03:29.140> before

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
slack events to shields as I said before

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.400 
slack events to shields as I said before
but<00:03:29.950> also<00:03:30.280> accommodates<00:03:30.820> for<00:03:30.940> sonic<00:03:31.420> speed<00:03:31.900> so

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
but also accommodates for sonic speed so

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.020 
but also accommodates for sonic speed so
you'll<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> lot<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.310> sections<00:03:33.670> where<00:03:33.940> you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
you'll see a lot of sections where you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.520 
you'll see a lot of sections where you
can<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.300> run<00:03:34.570> forward<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:34.990> then<00:03:35.140> press<00:03:35.350> down

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
can just run forward and then press down

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.350 
can just run forward and then press down
ham<00:03:35.860> roll<00:03:36.160> into<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.400> ball<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.820> go<00:03:36.940> super<00:03:37.330> fast

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
ham roll into a ball and go super fast

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.560 
ham roll into a ball and go super fast
and<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.650> much<00:03:38.980> fun<00:03:39.250> like<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.120> said<00:03:40.360> with

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
and it's so much fun like I said with

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.810 
and it's so much fun like I said with
Sonic<00:03:40.870> Blackie's<00:03:41.320> Wow<00:03:41.950> was<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.520> year

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
unlike any others in the sonic franchise

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.270 
unlike any others in the sonic franchise
the<00:04:01.780> official<00:04:02.140> one<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.350> least<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.709> it's<00:04:03.160> a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
the official one at least as it's a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.550 
the official one at least as it's a
spike<00:04:03.580> shield<00:04:04.080> basically<00:04:05.080> what<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.320> does<00:04:05.350> is

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
spike shield basically what it does is

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.380 
spike shield basically what it does is
it<00:04:05.680> protects<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.130> from<00:04:06.160> spikes<00:04:06.640> obviously

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
it protects you from spikes obviously

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.970 
it protects you from spikes obviously
but<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.750> also<00:04:07.900> ground<00:04:08.320> stomp<00:04:08.590> with<00:04:08.709> it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
but you can also ground stomp with it

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.400 
but you can also ground stomp with it
which<00:04:09.130> is<00:04:09.160> kind<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.519> cool<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.420> if<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.140> ever

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
which is kind of cool so if you ever

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.380 
which is kind of cool so if you ever
need<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.920> make<00:04:12.370> sure<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.670> your<00:04:12.790> platforming

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
need to make sure that your platforming

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.240 
need to make sure that your platforming
is<00:04:13.540> on<00:04:13.660> point<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.170> can<00:04:14.320> just<00:04:14.350> grant<00:04:14.709> stop<00:04:14.950> or

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
is on point you can just grant stop or

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.440 
is on point you can just grant stop or
if<00:04:15.310> there's<00:04:15.459> an<00:04:15.549> enemy<00:04:15.670> below<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.330> just

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
if there's an enemy below you can just

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.539 
if there's an enemy below you can just
ground<00:04:16.720> stop<00:04:16.989> there's<00:04:17.470> also<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.859> reverse

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
ground stop there's also a reverse

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.449 
ground stop there's also a reverse
bubble<00:04:19.150> shield<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.650> really<00:04:21.190> cool

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
bubble shield and that is really cool

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.890 
bubble shield and that is really cool
because<00:04:21.729> it's<00:04:22.060> essentially<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.660> bubble

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
because it's essentially the bubble

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.120 
because it's essentially the bubble
shield<00:04:23.050> mixed<00:04:23.320> with<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.530> electric<00:04:23.919> shield

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
shield mixed with the electric shield

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.250 
shield mixed with the electric shield
you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.490> jump<00:04:24.729> higher<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.360> if<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.080> hit

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
you can jump higher and if you get hit

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.930 
you can jump higher and if you get hit
underwater<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.919> only<00:04:27.070> lose<00:04:27.400> your<00:04:27.610> rings<00:04:27.790> you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
underwater you only lose your rings you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.060 
underwater you only lose your rings you
don't<00:04:27.970> lose<00:04:28.270> your<00:04:28.419> shield<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.080> that's<00:04:29.770> kind<00:04:30.040> of

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
don't lose your shield so that's kind of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.530 
don't lose your shield so that's kind of
cool<00:04:30.130> because<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:31.120> don't<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.419> worry

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
cool because you don't have to worry

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.240 
cool because you don't have to worry
about<00:04:31.660> drowning<00:04:32.169> which<00:04:32.350> is<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.530> certain<00:04:33.010> thing

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
about drowning which is a certain thing

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.219 
about drowning which is a certain thing
in<00:04:33.400> Sonic<00:04:33.760> games<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.180> I'm<00:04:34.270> terrified<00:04:34.600> of<00:04:34.780> so

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.840 
my favorite is zone in the game has to
be<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.680> second<00:05:58.070> one<00:05:58.220> and<00:05:58.400> it's<00:05:58.520> not<00:05:58.670> for

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
be the second one and it's not for

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.760 
be the second one and it's not for
reasons<00:05:59.180> you<00:05:59.300> may<00:05:59.420> think<00:05:59.750> it's<00:05:59.990> because<00:06:00.440> I

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
reasons you may think it's because I

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.580 
reasons you may think it's because I
originally<00:06:01.670> thought<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.930> I<00:06:02.960> didn't<00:06:03.470> read

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
originally thought that I didn't read

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.590 
originally thought that I didn't read
the<00:06:03.710> title<00:06:04.010> of<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.220> zone<00:06:04.430> it's<00:06:04.760> sugar<00:06:05.210> splash

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
the title of the zone it's sugar splash

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.140 
the title of the zone it's sugar splash
so<00:06:05.990> all<00:06:06.140> the<00:06:06.260> white<00:06:06.470> powder<00:06:06.740> is<00:06:06.980> sugar<00:06:07.250> but

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
so all the white powder is sugar but

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.460 
so all the white powder is sugar but
that's<00:06:08.300> not<00:06:08.450> what<00:06:08.570> I<00:06:08.600> thought<00:06:08.780> at<00:06:08.930> first<00:06:08.960> I

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
that's not what I thought at first I

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.690 
that's not what I thought at first I
thought<00:06:09.800> that<00:06:10.040> all<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.250> white<00:06:10.430> powder

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
thought that all the white powder

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.460 
thought that all the white powder
sprinkled<00:06:11.480> throughout<00:06:11.690> this<00:06:11.930> level<00:06:12.260> was

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
sprinkled throughout this level was

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.800 
sprinkled throughout this level was
cocaine

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
cocaine

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.530 
cocaine

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
so whatever sunny grabs it his eyes go

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.900 
so whatever sunny grabs it his eyes go
huge<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.260> he<00:06:18.350> runs<00:06:18.560> super<00:06:18.980> fast<00:06:19.250> come<00:06:19.640> on<00:06:19.760> you
