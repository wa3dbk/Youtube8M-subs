00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.450 
large tips work well for this this is
pretty<00:00:33.030> easy<00:00:33.270> process<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
pretty easy process you just put it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.750 
pretty easy process you just put it
straight<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.020> swirl<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.520> with

straight down and you just swirl it with
pressure<00:00:39.210> around<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.180> that's<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> would

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pressure around and that's it so would

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
pressure around and that's it so would
be<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.969> hard<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.360> mess<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.640> you
