and a pipe so you didn't want to take

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.730 
and a pipe so you didn't want to take
the<00:01:06.390> risk<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.750> puncturing<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> pipes

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the risk of puncturing one of the pipes

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
the risk of puncturing one of the pipes
and<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.640> done<00:01:08.850> instead<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:10.049> put

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
these brackets on the sides the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
these brackets on the sides the
horizontal<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> vertical<00:01:15.509> one

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
horizontal one and then the vertical one

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
horizontal one and then the vertical one
going<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:16.830> angle<00:01:16.979> that'll<00:01:17.549> support

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
going down at an angle that'll support

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
going down at an angle that'll support
the<00:01:18.299> full<00:01:18.540> weight<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> cabinets<00:01:19.770> going

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
across the space plus you got a full

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.899 
across the space plus you got a full
