would<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> next<00:01:47.040> best<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.820> then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
would be the next best thing and then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
would be the next best thing and then
from<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.689> there's<00:01:49.140> other<00:01:49.439> products<00:01:49.920> here

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
from then on there's other products here

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.630 
from then on there's other products here
don't<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.360> 100%<00:01:52.130> acrylic<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.490> they

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
don't that are not 100% acrylic but they

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.990 
don't that are not 100% acrylic but they
will<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.939> hold<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:56.009> best<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
will not hold it the best way to go on a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.959 
will not hold it the best way to go on a
textured<00:01:57.659> surface<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> smooth<00:01:58.740> surface

textured surface on a smooth surface
smooth<00:01:59.969> stuff<00:02:00.210> though<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.509> don't<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> do

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
smooth stuff though you don't want to do

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.950 
smooth stuff though you don't want to do
it<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> textured<00:02:02.670> surface<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.840> know

it but a textured surface you you know

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
it but a textured surface you you know
it<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.469> probably<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> best<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.369> go

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it would be probably the best way to go

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.490 
it would be probably the best way to go
it's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:06.630> pricey<00:02:06.899> because

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it's a little more pricey because

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.479 
it's a little more pricey because
basically<00:02:07.789> doesn't<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.539> isn't<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
basically doesn't do it isn't go the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
basically doesn't do it isn't go the
same<00:02:11.670> amount<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> square<00:02:12.330> footage<00:02:12.569> per<00:02:12.989> gal

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
same amount of square footage per gal

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.020 
same amount of square footage per gal
it<00:02:14.160> probably<00:02:14.370> goes<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:14.940> half<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:16.110> that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it probably goes about half if that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.090 
it probably goes about half if that
anywhere<00:02:18.030> from<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> hunter<00:02:18.780> 50<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.920> nerd

400 square feet or say a hundred hundred
percent<00:02:25.440> acrylic<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.010> you're<00:02:26.190> using<00:02:26.340> quite<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
percent acrylic so you're using quite a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400 
percent acrylic so you're using quite a
bit<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.880> more<00:02:27.060> material<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.080> there's<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> little

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
bit of more material so there's a little

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.940 
bit of more material so there's a little
more<00:02:28.500> costly<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.470> these<00:02:31.530> lessons

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
more costly it's one of these lessons

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.220 
more costly it's one of these lessons
and<00:02:32.220> Manav<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> number<00:02:33.060> 130<00:02:33.480> anytime<00:02:34.110> you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and Manav is the number 130 anytime you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
and Manav is the number 130 anytime you

sure you match apples with apples if

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.480

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it with one code or they probably lot of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.180 
it with one code or they probably lot of
times<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:45.989> won't<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> preparation<00:02:47.040> like

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
times they won't do the preparation like

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.720 
times they won't do the preparation like
they're<00:02:47.400> supposed<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.830> those<00:02:50.489> are<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
they're supposed to do and those are the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.250 
they're supposed to do and those are the
ways<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.030> mean<00:02:51.180> they<00:02:51.300> might<00:02:51.480> water<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
ways I mean they might water down the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.949 
ways I mean they might water down the
paint<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.920> definitely<00:02:53.280> want<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.840> don't

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
paint you definitely want to you don't

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.810 
paint you definitely want to you don't
always<00:02:55.260> want<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.860> looking<00:02:56.550> for<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
always want to be looking for the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.699 
always want to be looking for the
cheapest<00:02:57.180> price<00:02:57.209> out<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:58.530> not

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
cheapest price out there that's not

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.830 
cheapest price out there that's not
always<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.130> best<00:02:59.760> way<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.540> mean<00:03:00.570> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
always the best way to do it I mean you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
always the best way to do it I mean you
got<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> match<00:03:01.680> apples<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.190> apples<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
got a match apples with apples and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.280 
got a match apples with apples and
hopefully<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> referral<00:03:04.140> or

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
hopefully you can get a referral or

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.260 
hopefully you can get a referral or
something<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.090> information

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
something that you can get information

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.270 
something that you can get information
about<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.050> contractor<00:03:07.590> before<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.160> with

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
about the contractor before you go with

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.940 
about the contractor before you go with
them<00:03:08.430> when<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.790> comes<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> us<00:03:09.330> we<00:03:10.050> always<00:03:10.290> do

them when it comes to us we always do

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.430 
them when it comes to us we always do
the<00:03:11.070> best<00:03:11.459> type<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.910> preparation<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.260> don't

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the best type of preparation I don't

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.530 
the best type of preparation I don't
think<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.680> haven't<00:03:13.890> seen<00:03:14.100> anybody<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.760> much
