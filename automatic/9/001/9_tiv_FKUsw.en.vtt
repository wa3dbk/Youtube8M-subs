to find inside this box what's a runner

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.780 
to find inside this box what's a runner
you<00:01:09.610> might<00:01:09.640> ask<00:01:09.970> well<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.229> are<00:01:11.380> these<00:01:11.790> gates

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
you might ask well they are these gates

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.109 
you might ask well they are these gates
of<00:01:13.030> plastic<00:01:13.479> where<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.780> parts<00:01:14.050> are<00:01:14.140> connected

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119

this<00:01:16.119> model<00:01:16.479> has<00:01:16.630> seems<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.290> have<00:01:17.410> about<00:01:17.729> six

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
this model has seems to have about six

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.280 
this model has seems to have about six
or<00:01:18.850> seven<00:01:19.090> runners<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:19.930> should<00:01:20.170> go

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
or seven runners so you should go

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.889 
or seven runners so you should go
through<00:01:20.619> comparison<00:01:21.610> your<00:01:21.850> manual<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.420> make

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
through comparison your manual and make

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.840 
through comparison your manual and make
sure<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.140> all<00:01:23.830> your<00:01:24.250> runners<00:01:24.520> are<00:01:24.670> here

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
sure that all your runners are here

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.070 
sure that all your runners are here
before<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.180> even<00:01:25.330> start<00:01:25.540> cutting<00:01:25.780> things<00:01:25.899> up

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
before you even start cutting things up

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.030 
before you even start cutting things up
because<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.440> don't<00:01:26.560> want<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.740> get<00:01:26.830> half<00:01:27.009> way

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
because you don't want to get half way

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.260 
because you don't want to get half way
through<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> build<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.759> realize<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.180> you're

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
through a build and realize that you're

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.690 
through a build and realize that you're
missing<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.570> whole<00:01:28.600> bunch<00:01:28.869> of<00:01:28.930> pieces<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
missing a whole bunch of pieces in the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.460 
missing a whole bunch of pieces in the
manual<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.240> will<00:01:31.360> notice<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.900> some<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
manual you will notice that some of the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.500 
manual you will notice that some of the
runners<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.340> parts<00:01:33.670> have<00:01:33.820> zl--<00:01:34.000> exits

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
runners the parts have zl-- exits

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.700 
runners the parts have zl-- exits
through<00:01:34.659> them<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.110> means<00:01:35.320> that<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.590> don't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
through them this means that you don't

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.590 
through them this means that you don't
need<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.100> part<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.490> complete<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.850> model<00:01:37.150> so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
need this part to complete the model so

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.820 
need this part to complete the model so
if<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.810> fit<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.229> get<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.620> end<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
if you fit you get to the end of the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.770 
if you fit you get to the end of the
model<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.430> have<00:01:39.460> some<00:01:39.760> extra<00:01:40.000> pieces<00:01:40.150> you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
model and you have some extra pieces you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.000 
model and you have some extra pieces you
don't<00:01:40.960> need<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.170> worry<00:01:41.320> about<00:01:44.010> everything

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
don't need to worry about everything

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.940 
don't need to worry about everything
seems<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.310> be<00:01:45.400> here<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:47.229> kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.500> tools<00:01:47.710> do

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
seems to be here what kind of tools do

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.050 
seems to be here what kind of tools do
we<00:01:47.979> use<00:01:48.190> when<00:01:48.369> we're<00:01:48.490> building<00:01:48.610> these<00:01:48.850> things

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
we use when we're building these things

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.090 
we use when we're building these things
well<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:49.750> only<00:01:49.990> need<00:01:50.110> one<00:01:50.409> perhaps<00:01:50.710> to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
well you really only need one perhaps to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.450 
well you really only need one perhaps to
what<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.000> use<00:01:52.270> always<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.650> side<00:01:54.070> cutters

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
what I use always is the side cutters

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.820 
what I use always is the side cutters
you<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:55.659> use<00:01:55.810> these<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.140> take<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.439> parts<00:01:56.710> off

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
you can use these to take the parts off

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.950 
you can use these to take the parts off
of<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> runner<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.909> well<00:01:58.210> as<00:01:58.450> trimming<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
of the runner as well as trimming the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.649 
of the runner as well as trimming the
parts<00:01:59.229> down<00:01:59.380> but<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.250> also<00:02:00.400> use<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:01.030> hobby

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
parts down but you can also use a hobby

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.149 
parts down but you can also use a hobby
knife<00:02:01.900> for<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.200> trimming<00:02:02.409> part<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.890> I'll
