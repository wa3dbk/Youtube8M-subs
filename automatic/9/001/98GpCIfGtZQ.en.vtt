little<00:01:05.129> feature<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.170> find<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
little feature here to find out the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
little feature here to find out the
distance<00:01:08.400> between<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.390> points<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.590> by

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
distance between two points just by

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.750 
distance between two points just by
using<00:01:11.390> two<00:01:12.390> pins<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.549> cool

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
using two pins it's very very cool

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.109
