00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
to all come this but a lot of times my

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.130 
to all come this but a lot of times my
clients<00:02:04.039> will<00:02:04.160> tell<00:02:04.369> me<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:05.179> find<00:02:06.049> it

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
clients will tell me that I find it

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.510 
clients will tell me that I find it
really<00:02:06.200> difficult<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.770> curl<00:02:07.009> my<00:02:07.040> own<00:02:07.250> hair

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
really difficult to curl my own hair

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.789 
really difficult to curl my own hair
because<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.149> smelled<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> never<00:02:08.750> hold<00:02:09.049> and<00:02:09.679> it

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
because it smelled it never hold and it

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.970 
because it smelled it never hold and it
doesn't<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.870> just<00:02:11.870> can't<00:02:12.019> get<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.440> curl<00:02:12.680> but

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
doesn't I just can't get it to curl but

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.890 
doesn't I just can't get it to curl but
I<00:02:13.010> don't<00:02:13.250> have<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.489> patience<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.750> this

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
I don't have the patience for it so this

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.590 
I don't have the patience for it so this
is<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.140> good<00:02:15.290> solution<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
is a good solution and you see the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.750 
is a good solution and you see the
session<00:02:17.989> with<00:02:18.280> will<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.579> make<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
session with will really make a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.830 
session with will really make a
difference<00:02:20.000> in

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
difference in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.509 
difference in
and<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.170> their<00:02:22.319> last<00:02:22.499> section<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.400> as

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and this is their last section and as

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.520 
and this is their last section and as
you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:23.849> each<00:02:24.299> curl<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.870> start<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.409> at

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you can see each curl I start right at

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.199 
you can see each curl I start right at
the<00:02:25.560> base<00:02:27.079> slide<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.260> through<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:29.700> grab<00:02:29.999> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
the base slide it through just grab the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.839 
the base slide it through just grab the
tail<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.469> keep<00:02:31.709> slowly<00:02:32.040> sliding<00:02:32.519> it

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
tail and just keep slowly sliding it

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.270 
tail and just keep slowly sliding it
through<00:02:32.959> weekly<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.889> nice<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
through weekly you know it's nice and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.459 
through weekly you know it's nice and
more<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:35.939> allows<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.389> more<00:02:36.810> even<00:02:37.019> curl

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
more this allows a more even curl

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.920 
more this allows a more even curl
distribution<00:02:38.269> through<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.359> hair<00:02:39.540> strand

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
distribution through the hair strand

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.869 
distribution through the hair strand
rather<00:02:40.319> than<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.769> driving<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.219> at<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> ends

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.089 
rather than just driving it at the ends
and<00:02:42.060> twirling<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.870> then<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> ends<00:02:43.920> get

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
and twirling it up then the ends get

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.770 
and twirling it up then the ends get
more<00:02:44.280> curled<00:02:44.549> than<00:02:44.730> anywhere<00:02:45.060> else<00:02:45.120> where<00:02:45.659> is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
more curled than anywhere else where is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.140 
more curled than anywhere else where is
this<00:02:45.980> creature<00:02:46.980> more<00:02:47.280> even<00:02:47.609> now<00:02:48.000> we're<00:02:48.120> just

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this creature more even now we're just

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.869 
this creature more even now we're just
going<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.480> let<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.689> cool<00:02:49.079> for<00:02:49.409> one<00:02:49.620> minute

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
going to let that cool for one minute

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.059 
going to let that cool for one minute
with<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:50.999> air<00:02:51.150> good<00:02:51.419> at<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.870> want<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.829> let<00:02:52.950> they
