so this would be a good opportunity to

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.990 
so this would be a good opportunity to
when<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.989> odds<00:02:45.110> are<00:02:45.290> much<00:02:45.349> better<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:46.000> so

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
when the odds are much better there so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.729
