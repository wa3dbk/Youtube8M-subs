don't<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> reason<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

don't really see the reason for it but
um<00:01:28.619> refinery<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> come<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.210> pretty

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
good choice anyway because mass lings

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.560 
good choice anyway because mass lings

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840

shows that Hellion off that's a little
confusing<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.550> definitely<00:04:50.120> would<00:04:51.020> not<00:04:51.170> suggest

confusing I definitely would not suggest
that<00:04:51.950> course<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.430> action<00:04:52.520> I<00:04:52.880> mean<00:04:53.450> maybe<00:04:53.660> if

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that course of action I mean maybe if

that course of action I mean maybe if
this<00:04:53.960> link<00:04:54.200> spotted<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.590> Hellion<00:04:54.890> already

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
this link spotted the Hellion already

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.180 
this link spotted the Hellion already
sure<00:04:55.850> but<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:57.260> fact<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.770> Hellion<00:04:58.040> could

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
sure but the fact that the Hellion could

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.500 
sure but the fact that the Hellion could
have<00:04:58.280> just<00:04:58.460> hid<00:04:58.580> back<00:04:58.730> here<00:04:58.970> until<00:04:59.270> Morrow's

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
have just hid back here until Morrow's

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.030 
have just hid back here until Morrow's

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.640 
ready for his first big push would have
been<00:05:01.160> actually<00:05:01.490> superior<00:05:02.420> I<00:05:02.630> believe<00:05:03.350> but

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
been actually superior I believe but

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.770 
been actually superior I believe but

little bit prone to Hellion attacks if
morrow<00:05:19.730> does<00:05:19.940> show<00:05:20.090> up<00:05:20.240> soon<00:05:20.500> it<00:05:21.500> looks<00:05:21.710> like

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
morrow does show up soon it looks like

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.320 
morrow does show up soon it looks like
Morrow's<00:05:22.070> going<00:05:22.340> for<00:05:22.490> an<00:05:22.580> all-in<00:05:22.850> like<00:05:23.060> we<00:05:23.180> saw

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
Morrow's going for an all-in like we saw

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.880 
Morrow's going for an all-in like we saw
in<00:05:23.360> metal<00:05:23.660> opolis<00:05:23.930> he's<00:05:24.200> pulled<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.620> lot<00:05:24.830> of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
in metal opolis he's pulled a lot of

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.850 
in metal opolis he's pulled a lot of
suvs<00:05:25.370> here<00:05:25.660> even<00:05:26.660> pulled<00:05:26.840> his<00:05:26.960> mule<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:27.380> mules

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
suvs here even pulled his mule but mules

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.800 
suvs here even pulled his mule but mules
can't<00:05:28.070> attack<00:05:28.340> so<00:05:28.850> he<00:05:29.030> goes<00:05:29.240> ahead<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:29.600> sends

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
can't attack so he goes ahead and sends

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.250 
can't attack so he goes ahead and sends
him<00:05:29.960> home<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:31.450> these<00:05:32.450> first<00:05:32.720> four<00:05:32.870> hellions

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
him home and these first four hellions

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.020 
him home and these first four hellions
do<00:05:33.440> show<00:05:33.620> up<00:05:33.650> it<00:05:34.250> looks<00:05:34.490> like<00:05:34.640> they<00:05:34.760> did<00:05:34.910> not

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
do show up it looks like they did not

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.400 
do show up it looks like they did not
get<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.210> shot<00:05:35.420> off<00:05:35.450> on<00:05:35.690> this<00:05:35.780> crawler<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.320> they

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
get a shot off on this crawler so they

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.540 
get a shot off on this crawler so they
are<00:05:36.470> going<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.680> meet<00:05:36.830> up<00:05:36.950> with<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.190> rest<00:05:37.370> of

are going to meet up with the rest of
the<00:05:37.670> forces<00:05:37.970> he's<00:05:38.540> actually<00:05:38.690> going<00:05:38.960> a<00:05:39.110> long

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
the forces he's actually going a long

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.350 
the forces he's actually going a long
way<00:05:39.470> around<00:05:39.590> here<00:05:40.160> just<00:05:40.760> to<00:05:40.850> make<00:05:41.030> sure<00:05:41.060> he

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
way around here just to make sure he

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.690 
way around here just to make sure he
doesn't<00:05:41.540> get<00:05:41.720> spotted<00:05:42.200> perhaps<00:05:42.620> he<00:05:43.430> didn't

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
doesn't get spotted perhaps he didn't

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.010 
doesn't get spotted perhaps he didn't

see any overlords I don't know maybe

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.810 
see any overlords I don't know maybe
he's<00:05:45.200> just<00:05:45.320> spotting<00:05:45.710> make<00:05:46.190> sure<00:05:46.310> edges<00:05:46.670> not

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
he's just spotting make sure edges not

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.160 
he's just spotting make sure edges not
doing<00:05:47.030> anything<00:05:47.210> sneaky<00:05:47.570> going<00:05:47.930> for<00:05:48.080> this

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
doing anything sneaky going for this

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.450 
doing anything sneaky going for this
high<00:05:48.350> yield<00:05:48.590> early<00:05:48.920> or<00:05:49.010> something<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.400> that

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
high yield early or something like that

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.370 
high yield early or something like that
would<00:05:50.330> have<00:05:50.450> been<00:05:50.510> really<00:05:50.570> easy<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:51.080> pick<00:05:51.230> off

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
would have been really easy to pick off

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.140 
would have been really easy to pick off
had<00:05:51.620> he<00:05:51.650> been<00:05:51.950> doing<00:05:52.220> that<00:05:52.340> but<00:05:52.520> all<00:05:52.880> these

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
had he been doing that but all these

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.180 
had he been doing that but all these
SUVs<00:05:53.390> here<00:05:53.840> being<00:05:54.050> pulled<00:05:54.260> so<00:05:54.590> this<00:05:54.860> is<00:05:55.040> pretty

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
SUVs here being pulled so this is pretty

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.590 
SUVs here being pulled so this is pretty
much<00:05:55.310> an<00:05:55.520> all-in<00:05:55.820> attack<00:05:56.060> he's<00:05:56.270> not<00:05:56.420> even

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
much an all-in attack he's not even

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.540 
much an all-in attack he's not even
planning<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.960> expand<00:05:57.260> finally<00:05:57.950> comes<00:05:58.250> in<00:05:58.400> with

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
