while to get my groove on but after a
while<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.209> enjoyed<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.780> was

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
while I really enjoyed it it was

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.110 
while I really enjoyed it it was
actually<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> first<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:13.980> I'd<00:02:14.310> ever<00:02:14.340> sat

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
actually the first time I'd ever sat

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
actually the first time I'd ever sat
down<00:02:15.329> and<00:02:15.690> read<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.140> whole<00:02:16.320> book<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> way

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
down and read the whole book all the way

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
down and read the whole book all the way
through<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.690> course<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.079> found<00:02:19.290> little

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
through so of course I found little

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
through so of course I found little
areas<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.609> thought

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
areas that I thought

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330 
areas that I thought
I<00:02:21.180> should<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:21.769> polished<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.129> little

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I should have polished that up a little

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.070 
I should have polished that up a little
bit<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.970> could<00:02:24.330> probably<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
bit but I could probably do that the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.539 
bit but I could probably do that the
rest<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.409> my<00:02:25.530> life<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.920> always<00:02:26.280> find

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
rest of my life and always find

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.060 
rest of my life and always find
something
