once<00:00:20.730> we've<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.420> baffle<00:00:21.990> system<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.529> here

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
once we've got a baffle system in here

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939 
once we've got a baffle system in here
so<00:00:23.250> when<00:00:23.640> these<00:00:23.760> live<00:00:24.029> wheels<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.480> full<00:00:24.949> -

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so when these live wheels are full -

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
so when these live wheels are full -
right<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:27.269> baffle<00:00:27.720> system<00:00:27.840> really

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
right here this baffle system really

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
right here this baffle system really
keeps<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.650> water<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.130> sloshing<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.939> when

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
keeps that water from sloshing but when

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
keeps that water from sloshing but when
a<00:00:30.090> fish<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.779> my<00:00:30.929> live<00:00:31.140> well<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> fish

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a fish is in my live well the fish

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
a fish is in my live well the fish
always<00:00:32.040> sits<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.640> its<00:00:32.790> nose<00:00:33.000> against<00:00:33.450> the

wall if I'm being really rough water
he's<00:00:36.059> gonna<00:00:36.239> bump<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.140> instead<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> my<00:00:38.040> pumps

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
he's gonna bump this instead of my pumps

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
he's gonna bump this instead of my pumps
up<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.450> lid<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> protects<00:00:41.160> my

the biggest these libels actually come
all<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.840> under<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> seats<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.789> put

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
all the way up under the seats I can put

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.810 
all the way up under the seats I can put
a<00:00:51.030> 30<00:00:51.570> pound<00:00:51.780> bag<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> had<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.579> side

wouldn't it be nice 30 pound bag but

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
wouldn't it be nice 30 pound bag but
they're<00:00:55.860> insulated<00:00:56.340> no<00:00:56.610> other<00:00:56.760> boats<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
they're insulated no other boats have

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.189 
they're insulated no other boats have
insulated<00:00:57.899> live<00:00:58.199> wheels<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
insulated live wheels and then I have a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
insulated live wheels and then I have a
cooling<00:01:01.739> system<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.370> nitro<00:01:02.699> boat<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.390> let's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
cooling system on my nitro boat so let's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
cooling system on my nitro boat so let's
talk<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.619> out

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
talk about this a little bit I'm out

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
talk about this a little bit I'm out
there<00:01:04.979> fishing<00:01:05.220> deep<00:01:05.519> let's<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.060> Table

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
there fishing deep let's say on Table

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
know water temperatures 96 degrees can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
know water temperatures 96 degrees can
get<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> 96<00:01:15.210> degrees<00:01:15.479> surface<00:01:15.900> tip<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.320> you

get to 96 degrees surface tip and you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730 
get to 96 degrees surface tip and you
catch<00:01:16.830> fish<00:01:17.100> 16<00:01:17.759> 20<00:01:18.210> maybe<00:01:18.420> 30<00:01:18.570> feet<00:01:19.110> deep<00:01:19.470> I

catch fish 16 20 maybe 30 feet deep I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.999 
catch fish 16 20 maybe 30 feet deep I
can<00:01:20.460> cool<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:21.360> live<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:22.009> temperature

without ever dropping one bag of ice in
my<00:01:25.830> live<00:01:26.070> look<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
my live look right here in this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.319 
my live look right here in this
compartment<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.409> water<00:01:28.650> circulates<00:01:29.400> through

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
compartment the water circulates through

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
compartment the water circulates through
these<00:01:30.540> radiators<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.350> ice<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.890> melted

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
these radiators my ice is all melted

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.460 
these radiators my ice is all melted
it's<00:01:32.400> late<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> day<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:34.229> water

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it's late in the day but my water

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's late in the day but my water
circulates<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:35.549> these<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:35.939> radiators

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
circulates through these two radiators

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.319 
circulates through these two radiators
and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.229> cools<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.920> water<00:01:38.159> temperature<00:01:38.700> down

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and it cools this water temperature down

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
and it cools this water temperature down
to<00:01:39.780> 70<00:01:40.530> degrees<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> I've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> set<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to 70 degrees is what I've got to set it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
to 70 degrees is what I've got to set it
