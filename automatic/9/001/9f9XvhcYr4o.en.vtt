00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.289
 and always end up false Keep me 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.420
 I point to friends to relax 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 have fun and enjoy my time 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.410
 free 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.150
 I walk longboard about two years ago 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.700
 and a half 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.910
 actually start by means of a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.910
 friend 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.040
 it does not come to anything by riding bread 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.800
 my name is manuela I am 21 years old and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.530
 This tradition 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.869
 in my free time besides studying and 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.960
 command the longboard I learned when I was 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.780
 very small with 6 years old but makes 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.180
 some 34 years that I started to give them more 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.710
 strong and learn to do several things 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.450
 doing like I get rid of everything 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 he studied a lot all day long 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.079
 that as my free time I relax 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 I put the music I do not listen to anyone and 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.530
 I threw myself 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.760
 jeremías and good nothing I am student of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 architecture the most practical what 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.370
 called freeride austin that is like the most 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.409
 common 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.319
 against basically the angels 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.539
 crouch down in a pose that 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.060
 interrupt that you do less friction with 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.429
 the wind and you become a kind 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.719
 of racing car and good are also 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.470
 some that others who practice these 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.800
 more freestyle 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.810
 actually pulling different tricks not 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.860
 both of speed because with a little bit of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.550
 air the occasional jump 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.410
 go favorite 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.020
 and it's more general I can also know 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.410
 with this with the table most use roll 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.330
 hard and for his hoops some gloves 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.080
 with some special pulls that make 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.290
 who want to be more and nothing this month and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.550
 go down and down at a certain speed 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.950
 the gloves and that are more than resources 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.750
 the table clarifies why use a thousand 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.390
 different ways 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.890
 we can often raise the table then 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.319
 the table fly with the air 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.990
 omen because you're there on the floor there 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.630
 many rivers like a second when you tour 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.850
 your body and today the floor and now turn 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.220
 the tour rotates and I do not know if it does not end in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.890
 the floor if I'm going to be able to stop then 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.120
 that's how I really like that function of 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 not having in control is about things 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.209
 and 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.270
 and all that in a year or so looking 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.800
 the 60 thousand 276 there are videos is everything 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.050
 documented of them documented everything 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 start with the first skateboards 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.360
 trolleys with unarmed skates and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.430
 they start to start someone worries 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.900
 and start making tables with the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.810
 first wheels that were removed from urethane 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.569
 longboard in the beginning in pesos 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.010
 first that I marry you bring that came from 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.290
 the idea of admits them in california 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.300
 when there was not there a pool does not grab her 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.030
 and began to throw tricks mobility and 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.440
 I want to mix it a bit too 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.420
 they reflect little is what being was and with 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.880
 the skateboards copy the same 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.640
 movements up descents download plans 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.470
 inclined to climb to lower to be barefoot 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.360
 because they were not yet with york he quoted 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.550
 layer apparently for how little it is and 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.130
 filming in more of the silver 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.710
 like someone started with skateboarding with 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.710
 those linked to the being that is there is there 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.990
 it's more than anything where was born a lot to be the 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.910
 sea ​​of silver mainly and good and 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.340
 here started what is the movement of what 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.340
 moral white in 2002 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.400
 and now as 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:27.360
 a little quieter is something else 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.360
 familiar me 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:36.860
 it's a sport that does not require certain 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:39.860
 force certain balance 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.810
 as a certain hardness that's why the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.180
 Most of those who practice it are 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.090
 men however unlike the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.349
 skate and being is like the sport of 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.900
 table that more women airy and being 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.030
 woman on the longboard 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.320
 it's good it 's good because good 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.880
 guys who push to do things that 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.860
 layers one is not encouraged 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.900
 then instead of this with other girls 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.449
 fear baryon discs and beds you're not 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.460
 a little better than what I would have to 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.770
 do but there's also a whole theme 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.039
 good with the scar that's me 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.190

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.820
 these are the these are the protections 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:26.010
