number 7 dark ash blonde that didn't
cover<00:01:19.950> anything<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.759> had<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.240> darker<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cover anything so I had to go darker and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.399 
cover anything so I had to go darker and
whenever<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.770> number<00:01:23.460> 5<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.939> number<00:01:24.180> 5

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
whenever I put number 5 at is number 5
darker<00:01:25.409> shade<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.700> made<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> look

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
darker shade that kind of made it look

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.260 
darker shade that kind of made it look
even<00:01:27.930> more<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.710> burgundy<00:01:29.130> red<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:29.970> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
even more like a burgundy red it was I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
even more like a burgundy red it was I
just<00:01:30.869> couldn't<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> color<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.250> my

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
just couldn't get the color right so my

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.370 
just couldn't get the color right so my
only<00:01:32.549> option<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> go<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.140> black

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
only option was to go back to black

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.929 
only option was to go back to black
which<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.860> didn't<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.909> know

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
which I didn't want to do because I know

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
which I didn't want to do because I know
that<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.780> black<00:01:37.049> hair<00:01:37.439> dye<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> most

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that the black hair dye is the most

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
that the black hair dye is the most
difficult<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.290> decided<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
difficult to take out so I decided to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.539 
difficult to take out so I decided to
just<00:01:41.070> wait<00:01:41.400> until<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.600> travel<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.399> get<00:01:44.399> it

really work if people have seen results

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.280 
really work if people have seen results
and<00:03:58.709> what<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> pros<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.970> cons<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.840> decided

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and what are the pros and cons I decided

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
and what are the pros and cons I decided
to<00:04:01.470> give<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.739> try<00:04:01.950> for<00:04:02.190> myself<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> see<00:04:03.239> how

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
to give it a try for myself and see how

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.970 
to give it a try for myself and see how
it<00:04:03.690> will<00:04:03.870> react<00:04:04.200> with<00:04:04.410> my<00:04:04.560> body

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
it will react with my body

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.430 
it will react with my body
after<00:04:05.459> all<00:04:05.610> it's<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.970> natural<00:04:06.450> vitamin<00:04:07.140> complex

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
after all it's a natural vitamin complex

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.590 
after all it's a natural vitamin complex
that<00:04:07.830> helps<00:04:08.280> provide<00:04:08.730> nutrients<00:04:09.360> for<00:04:09.540> healthy

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that helps provide nutrients for healthy

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.000 
that helps provide nutrients for healthy
and<00:04:10.200> shiny<00:04:11.010> hair<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.050> if<00:04:13.050> it's<00:04:13.260> natural<00:04:13.709> then

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
and shiny hair so if it's natural then

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.770 
and shiny hair so if it's natural then
it<00:04:14.190> cannot<00:04:14.400> harm<00:04:14.700> me<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.090> was<00:04:15.329> my<00:04:15.480> thinking

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
it cannot harm me that was my thinking

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.590 
it cannot harm me that was my thinking
so<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.079> decided

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
so I decided

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.330 
so I decided
just<00:04:16.810> give<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:16.990> a<00:04:17.110> shot<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.620> when<00:04:17.770> I<00:04:17.890> was<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.160> Los
