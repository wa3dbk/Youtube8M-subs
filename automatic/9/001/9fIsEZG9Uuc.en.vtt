00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.970
 good morning with you i'm olga platonov and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.160
 good mood today we'll talk 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.269
 about one curious breeding method 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.089
 of plants 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.770
 This is a vegetative method and was invented in 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:19.289
 China sometimes needs to call 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.500
 roots to form a plant in order 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.710
 not to change its appearance not in 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.019
 the bottom of the debunk itself is usually to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.140
 this method is resorted to when the plant 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 takes some place in the garden or on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.070
 the windowsill and its height is very important as 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.500
 it's done i choose this 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 internodes there two below 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.390
 centimeter 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.020
 i make the cut with a very sharp knife or 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.020
 scalpel 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.329
 ring is ready to be here 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.579
 accumulate nutrients and 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.530
 rooting will occur 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 quickly we need moisture 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 for this I take sphagnum moss 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.590
 now this moss is wrapped in 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 plastic wrap and build something 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.820
 like a candy and start down below 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.520
 wind up 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.159
 candy our ribbon but the top 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.610
 part I 'm going to tie a bow 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 because periodically 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.220
 I will train water there 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 now i'm just before tying 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.000
 wetted with water 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.610
 now could we hold moisture 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.550
 the film creates a certain microclimate 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.740
 together the roots of education that's all through 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 two weeks approximately if you will 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.810
 time to water in this place will appear 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.050
 roots then you can cut off this shoot 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 and plant directly into the soil for 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.760
 enhancing the roots of the formation in water 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.000
 which you watering could add 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.200
 root roots love your plants and successful 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 all moods
