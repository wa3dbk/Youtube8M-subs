00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.459 
actually a frozen parfait we're gonna
use<00:00:30.839> the<00:00:31.050> ICI<00:00:31.739> gourmet<00:00:32.130> whip<00:00:33.350> we're<00:00:34.350> gonna

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
use the ICI gourmet whip we're gonna

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.099 
use the ICI gourmet whip we're gonna
aerate<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.609> make<00:00:36.329> sure<00:00:36.480> after<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.960> been

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
aerate the make sure after it's been

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.450 
aerate the make sure after it's been
mixed<00:00:37.289> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.769> we're<00:00:37.920> gonna<00:00:38.010> freeze<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
mixed and then we're gonna freeze it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.110 
mixed and then we're gonna freeze it
typically<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.750> would<00:00:40.460> whip<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.820> these

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
typically we would whip all these

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.669 
typically we would whip all these
components<00:00:42.660> separately<00:00:42.870> fold<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.500> together

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
components separately fold them together

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.770 
components separately fold them together
and<00:00:44.250> import<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> mold<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.539> sort<00:00:45.749> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and import into a mold and we're sort of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
and import into a mold and we're sort of
going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.019> combine<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.859> those<00:00:47.010> things<00:00:47.249> into

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
going to combine all those things into

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
going to combine all those things into
an<00:00:47.670> ISA<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:47.999> it<00:00:48.059> makes<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.749> functional

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
an ISA so it makes it very functional

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.180 
an ISA so it makes it very functional
and<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.640> creates<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.269> really<00:00:51.600> interesting

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
and it also creates a really interesting

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
and it also creates a really interesting
texture<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.460> us<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:53.760> looking<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.469> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
texture for us that we're looking for so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.329 
texture for us that we're looking for so
we've<00:00:55.589> got<00:00:55.769> Greek<00:00:56.730> yogurt<00:00:57.319> this<00:00:58.319> is<00:00:58.530> raw<00:00:58.769> cream

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
we've got Greek yogurt this is raw cream

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.479 
we've got Greek yogurt this is raw cream
raw<00:00:59.789> milk<00:00:59.999> cream<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.589> infused<00:01:01.589> with<00:01:01.920> some

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
raw milk cream that's infused with some

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
raw milk cream that's infused with some
wild<00:01:02.699> fennel<00:01:02.999> seeds<00:01:03.300> egg<00:01:04.290> whites<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.829> sugar

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
wild fennel seeds egg whites and sugar

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
wild fennel seeds egg whites and sugar
and<00:01:05.729> salt<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:06.960> basically<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.320> going

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and salt so we're basically just going

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.060 
and salt so we're basically just going
to<00:01:07.680> mix<00:01:08.490> everything<00:01:08.610> together<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to mix everything together and so this I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.810 
to mix everything together and so this I
mean<00:01:11.250> literally<00:01:12.560> cuts<00:01:13.560> out<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:14.700> enormous

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
mean literally cuts out an enormous

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539 
mean literally cuts out an enormous
amount<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> time<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.009> typically<00:01:17.430> we

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
amount of time you know typically we

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
amount of time you know typically we
would<00:01:17.640> whip<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.119> cream<00:01:18.570> separately<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.649> would

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
would whip the cream separately we would

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
would whip the cream separately we would
with<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> whites<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.210> two

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
with the whites and we would have two

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
with the whites and we would have two
different<00:01:21.630> installments<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> sugar<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
different installments of sugar one of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100 
different installments of sugar one of
the<00:01:22.920> whites<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> cream<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.049> we

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the whites one of the cream and then we

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
the whites one of the cream and then we
would<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.290> whatever<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:26.070> our<00:01:26.729> bases<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.570> we

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
would have whatever are our bases and we

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
would have whatever are our bases and we
fold<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> those<00:01:28.979> things<00:01:29.280> together<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
fold all of those things together and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.560 
fold all of those things together and
then<00:01:30.270> we'd<00:01:30.420> pipe<00:01:30.659> them

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
then we'd pipe them

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.730 
then we'd pipe them
into<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.689> mold<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:32.990> then<00:01:33.140> freeze<00:01:33.380> them<00:01:33.409> this

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
into the mold and then freeze them this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.100 
into the mold and then freeze them this
way<00:01:33.920> makes<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.850> lot<00:01:34.939> faster<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.509> actually

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
way makes it a lot faster it actually

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.929 
way makes it a lot faster it actually
has<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.320> kind<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.860> much<00:01:37.070> more<00:01:37.610> interesting

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
has a kind of a much more interesting

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.560 
has a kind of a much more interesting
look<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:39.820> just<00:01:40.820> sort<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.149> hold<00:01:41.420> a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
look to it that just sort of hold a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.460 
look to it that just sort of hold a
first<00:01:41.899> place

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
first place

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
first place
all<00:01:43.280> right<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:43.700> we're<00:01:44.450> pretty<00:01:44.600> much<00:01:44.780> there

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
all right so we're pretty much there

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.800 
all right so we're pretty much there
we're<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.610> gonna<00:01:46.700> take<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.659> half<00:01:50.659> a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
we're just gonna take this is a half a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.510 
we're just gonna take this is a half a
liter

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
liter
