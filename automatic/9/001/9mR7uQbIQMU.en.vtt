00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.600 
the messaging looks very nice I believe
it<00:01:47.020> does<00:01:47.140> come<00:01:47.380> with<00:01:47.470> color<00:01:47.740> keyboard<00:01:47.980> but<00:01:48.370> i'm

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it does come with color keyboard but i'm

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.610 
it does come with color keyboard but i'm
just<00:01:48.880> using<00:01:49.480> stock<00:01:49.870> because<00:01:50.110> i<00:01:50.320> think<00:01:50.380> it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
just using stock because i think it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.880 
just using stock because i think it
looks<00:01:50.800> better<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:53.170> i<00:01:53.260> did<00:01:53.440> actually<00:01:53.530> just

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
looks better because i did actually just

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.880 
looks better because i did actually just
jailbreak<00:01:54.160> again<00:01:54.460> today<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.740> let's<00:01:56.740> go<00:01:56.770> back

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890
