00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello how about how are you welcome to 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.160
 eating rich today we are going to 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.799
 prepare a dessert that everyone we 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.990
 like it's the flan Neapolitan flan 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.090
 Neapolitan one of the characteristics of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 This is also carrying milk 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.160
 cheese the one that gives it a consistency 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.230
 different texture and flavor I'm sure 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.359
 that everyone is going to show you these 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.970
 are the ingredients a can of milk 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.930
 evaporated a can of condensed milk 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 this is sweet milk 150 grams of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.280
 cream cheese this is a little less or 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.680
 we could say that they are three quarters 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.379
 parts of the whole bar of cheese a 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.109
 teaspoon vanilla extract 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.430
 four eggs and one cup of sugar is 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.949
 super rate that we're going to use 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.320
 to do our doctor that's how you 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.120
 prepare the first thing we should do 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.910
 to prepare our polynean program 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.190
 is to heat our oven everything depends 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.969
 of the temperature of the country in which 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.649
 find 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.559
 us the temperature that we already measured 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.080
 where in degrees fahrenheit and we're going to 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.950
 put our oven to warm to 350 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 fabio degrees 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.140
 there in Mexico in our countries where 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.969
 are used the degrees centigrade are 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.560
 180 degrees felt now what are we going to 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.509
 prepare that is our candy the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.729
 candy is a bit of a cost to make 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.320
 a lot of people are burning here I'm going to 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.479
 teach which ones gave him the trick that 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.399
 we use in this house to 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.670
 take out a candy practically 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.039
 we put to heat our our 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.539
 beforehand and we put that the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.380
 first first that we do at we dispose 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.039
 half cup 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.659
 Sugar see how the smoke out the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.360
 bed we beat it so that we do not know 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.940
 burn 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 what is left is how we want 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.030
 comment and it's fine with you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 groups but it still does not become liquid 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 then it's the way we're going to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.010
 making the game is a game because it gave me 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 something that must have our 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.290
 our pot and how can you 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.020
 count the preparation of this candy 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.170
 it's pretty fast why why 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.640
 now and it's hot then the point 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.990
 most important here is that we have 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.209
 we continue moving and beating our 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.570
 sample of sugar so that we do not get 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.570
 burn 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 with me once our our 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 candy to our sugar is from to 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.920
 this melting point is when you 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.400
 let's add the rest of the cup 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.200
 sugar here we put it we mix it and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.740
 we take advantage of it in a very efficient way 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.990
 the heat of the sugar already melted with the 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.000
 new sugar that we are putting and it 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.010
 will mix a uniform shape and let's 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.020
 to avoid that in this way we burn 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 the candy look at us the consistency 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.950
 what is having is getting another 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.950
 time a little solid but not a question 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.380
 two minutes later than three mats 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.930
 this candy will be completely 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.060
 ready so you do not burn from time to time 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.660
 when you have to take out our candy 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.550
 the fire for the lumps 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.010
 of the sugar that are still solid and 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.900
 big ones melt and do not follow 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 cooking or burning the candy not 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.090
 then it is very important that you take 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.710
 Look how is it going? 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.060
 leaving these groups here that 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.700
 dissolve in the candy already 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 practically melted but not 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.940
 I'm burning with the force of fire 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.950
 we have the candy ready we're going to 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.950
 put in this case in a refractory of 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.380
 crystal I'm going to put it in what I'm going to 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.480
 everywhere here 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.459
 they have to pretty 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.409
 Now that we have prepared our candy 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.900
 let's give everything next in the 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.720
 preparation of the end everything as I said is 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.030
 easy to do is very simple everything to 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.010
 the blender everything is mixed and in less 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.870
 of 5 minutes this is over 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.629
 then let's put our milk 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.180
 condensed is the law that says let's 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.660
 put here and now let's put our 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.660
 evaporated milk 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.000
 complicates the area and we add the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.250
 teaspoon vanilla extract 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.690
 just a little bit to give it a 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.970
 little bit of flavor we do not want the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.580
 flavor is very powerful vanilla we put 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.380
 our four eggs directly to the 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.540
 blender 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.389
 and then add the magic ingredient 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.999
 truth let's put the cheese 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.009
 add the teaspoon of extract of 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.810
 vanilla you swim a little to give 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.060
 a little bit of flavor we do not want the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.669
 flavor is very powerful vanilla we put 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.490
 our four eggs directly to the 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.629
 blender and then add the 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.629
 magic ingredient 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.030
 since we have all the ingredients in 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.759
 the blender as the next step is 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.759
 the next we are going to liquefy the two 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.280
 good friends our ingredients already 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.470
 they are perfectly liquefied I want to 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.450
 please take note that important 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.300
 it's important like condensed milk and 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.800
 the cheese are a bit thick is 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.990
 important that you put your 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.720
 blender to liquefy these ingredients 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 for about 35 minutes the joke is that 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.400
 they are perfectly well liquefied and 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.830
 perfectly and mixed the following 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.620
 step is that I'm going to add directly 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.590
 from the blender to the ica anniversary of 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.010
 well york where I have my candy I 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.470
 to add the light content of the plan 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.470
 I put it like that developing my way 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.030
 and what we are going to do now is that what 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.240
 let's cover it with some paper 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.240
 aluminum 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.870
 and we 're going to put it in another container in 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.090
 another glass refractory where already 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.490
 has water look at you how much water 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.560
 I'm putting him here to the refractory is 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.840
 approximately three quarters of 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.050
 water because that's what we're going to put 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.270
 so you have one because the plan is going 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.130
 to be a bain-marie then we need 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.250
 this water because we are going to put a 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.290
 average of an hour and a half in our 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.760
 oven we're going to put it in the oven and we 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.980
 we see in about an hour and a half 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.290
 Well here you have friends 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.470
 this is the Neapolitan well you what 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.680
 The plan was nice as it is even the 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.380
 color of the candy is therefore golden not 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.420
 It is not like a gold color is not 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.760
 black and then the texture is 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.330
 pretty good now, because the only thing 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.069
 we are left is to try 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.069
 Well, it was time to try it 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.670
 and an incredible texture does not seem that 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.340
 It is creamy but it really knows all 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.310
 Families count as always friends 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.650
