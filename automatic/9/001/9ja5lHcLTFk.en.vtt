with<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> name<00:01:35.880> suggests

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with this one and as the name suggests

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
with this one and as the name suggests
it<00:01:36.509> literally<00:01:36.840> stays<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> whole<00:01:37.770> entire<00:01:38.100> day

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it literally stays the whole entire day

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
it literally stays the whole entire day
so<00:01:38.700> before<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> begin<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so before you begin you really want to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
so before you begin you really want to
have<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> nice<00:01:40.500> idea<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> direction<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
have a nice idea of the direction that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
have a nice idea of the direction that
you<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.270> wing<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> want<00:01:43.290> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you want your wing to go so you want to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.139 
you want your wing to go so you want to
take<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.740> eyeliner<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.820> anything

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
take your eyeliner or really anything

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
take your eyeliner or really anything
that's<00:01:45.360> straight<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> pencil<00:01:46.290> or

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that's straight like a pencil or

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.200 
that's straight like a pencil or
anything<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> line

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
anything like that and you want to line

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.760 
anything like that and you want to line
it<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> edge<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.290> nostril

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it up right at the edge of your nostril

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 
it up right at the edge of your nostril
and<00:01:49.950> right<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> edge<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.540> eye<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and right at the edge of your eye and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
and right at the edge of your eye and
then<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> point<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> end<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.549> your

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then you want to point the end of your

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
then you want to point the end of your
stick<00:01:54.659> eyeliner<00:01:55.140> pencil<00:01:55.619> whatever<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:56.189> at

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
stick eyeliner pencil whatever right at

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440 
stick eyeliner pencil whatever right at
the<00:01:56.460> edge<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:56.969> eyebrow

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the edge of your eyebrow

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
the edge of your eyebrow
so<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.229> pretty<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so this is pretty much like the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
so this is pretty much like the
direction<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.700> waist<00:01:59.880> should<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.240> now

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
direction that your waist should go now

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.819 
direction that your waist should go now
I<00:02:00.509> find<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> mistake<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> people

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
I find a mistake that a lot of people

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.050 
I find a mistake that a lot of people
make<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.369> start<00:02:02.670> their<00:02:02.850> wing<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
make is that they start their wing a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
make is that they start their wing a
little<00:02:03.479> bit<00:02:03.600> too<00:02:03.810> far<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> actually

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
little bit too far in so it actually

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.740 
little bit too far in so it actually
makes<00:02:05.280> their<00:02:05.520> eyes<00:02:05.700> look<00:02:06.030> smaller<00:02:06.360> than<00:02:06.630> they

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
makes their eyes look smaller than they

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.809 
makes their eyes look smaller than they
are<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> start<00:02:08.340> your<00:02:08.580> wing

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
are you really want to start your wing

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.950 
are you really want to start your wing
right<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> outer<00:02:09.599> core

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
right at the outer core

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.530 
right at the outer core
I<00:02:10.020> almost<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.430> wing<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.850> continuing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
I almost like the wing is continuing

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.720 
I almost like the wing is continuing
from<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.050> lower<00:02:13.290> lashline<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.610> will

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
from your lower lashline and that will

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.760 
from your lower lashline and that will
just<00:02:14.850> create<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.810> nice<00:02:15.990> elongated

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
just create a really nice elongated

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.050 
just create a really nice elongated
effect<00:02:17.040> your<00:02:17.250> eyes<00:02:17.400> which<00:02:17.670> will<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:17.940> your

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
effect your eyes which will make your

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.570 
effect your eyes which will make your
eyes<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> very<00:02:18.420> cat-like<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.560> very<00:02:20.160> like

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
eyes a very cat-like and very like

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.730 
eyes a very cat-like and very like
almond<00:02:21.120> shaped<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> gorgeous<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
almond shaped which is gorgeous so the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.930 
almond shaped which is gorgeous so the
first<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.730> take<00:02:23.880> my

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
first thing I like to do is I take my

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
first thing I like to do is I take my
eyeliner<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.260> line<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:25.980> that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
eyeliner and I just line it up in that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.250 
eyeliner and I just line it up in that
direction<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.850> determined<00:02:27.480> before<00:02:27.990> so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
direction that we determined before so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.930 
direction that we determined before so
the<00:02:28.500> angle<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.010> where<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.310> wing<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.820> to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the angle of where the wing is going to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.020 
the angle of where the wing is going to
go<00:02:33.800> like<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.340> find<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.760> when<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
go like that and I find that when you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.760 
go like that and I find that when you
keep<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.390> eyes<00:02:36.540> open<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.170> makes<00:02:37.350> creating

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
keep your eyes open it makes creating

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.470 
keep your eyes open it makes creating
the<00:02:37.860> wing<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.220> lot<00:02:38.520> easier<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.300> you're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the wing a lot easier because if you're

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
the wing a lot easier because if you're
like<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.320> you're<00:02:40.590> trying<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.890> do<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
like this and you're trying to do it you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.040 
like this and you're trying to do it you
can't<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.550> see<00:02:41.970> what<00:02:42.540> you're<00:02:42.690> doing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
can't really see what you're doing

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840 
can't really see what you're doing
exactly<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.830> your<00:02:43.950> eyes<00:02:44.100> are<00:02:44.130> open<00:02:44.340> you're

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
exactly so if your eyes are open you're

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
exactly so if your eyes are open you're
looking<00:02:45.060> straight<00:02:45.270> ahead<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.780> you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
looking straight ahead and you're

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.630 
looking straight ahead and you're
squinting<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.710> little<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.400> makes

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
squinting just a little bit it makes

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640 
squinting just a little bit it makes
everything<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.180> lot<00:02:48.330> easier<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.080> now<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.320> want

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
everything a lot easier so now you want

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.050 
everything a lot easier so now you want
to<00:02:49.680> create<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.950> straight<00:02:50.280> line<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.640> goes<00:02:50.790> just

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
to create a straight line that goes just

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.000 
to create a straight line that goes just
below<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.450> point<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.020> created<00:02:52.410> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
below the point that you just created so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.920 
below the point that you just created so
that<00:02:53.130> goes<00:02:53.280> straight<00:02:53.460> down<00:02:54.030> towards<00:02:54.840> your

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that goes straight down towards your

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.110 
that goes straight down towards your
lash<00:02:55.140> line<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.100> creates<00:02:56.460> sort<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
lash line so this creates sort of like a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.460 
lash line so this creates sort of like a
triangle<00:02:57.750> shape

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.470 

and<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.490> can<00:03:06.610> see<00:03:06.760> there's<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.030> lot<00:03:07.330> of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and as you can see there's a lot of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000 
and as you can see there's a lot of
space<00:03:07.630> over<00:03:07.930> there<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.470> literally<00:03:08.860> just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
space over there but I'm literally just

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.290 
space over there but I'm literally just
going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.520> color<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.060> now<00:03:10.330> with<00:03:10.570> my<00:03:11.070> liner

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
going to color it and now with my liner

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.030 
going to color it and now with my liner
and<00:03:13.300> then<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.660> could<00:03:13.810> also<00:03:13.840> go<00:03:14.350> back<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.950> just

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and then you could also go back and just

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.130 
and then you could also go back and just
perfect<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.790> line<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> bit<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.050> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
perfect that line a bit so just make it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.100 
perfect that line a bit so just make it
a<00:03:17.200> little<00:03:17.410> straighter<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:22.840> see<00:03:22.900> if

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
a little straighter so as you can see if

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.990 
a little straighter so as you can see if
I<00:03:23.170> close<00:03:23.380> my<00:03:23.410> eye<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.370> pretty<00:03:24.790> much<00:03:24.880> a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
I close my eye it is pretty much a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.180 
I close my eye it is pretty much a
straight<00:03:25.480> line<00:03:25.690> right<00:03:25.870> from<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.230> tip<00:03:26.440> down<00:03:27.010> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
straight line right from the tip down to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.500 
straight line right from the tip down to
my<00:03:27.250> lash<00:03:27.430> line<00:03:27.460> but<00:03:27.760> when<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> open<00:03:28.210> my<00:03:28.240> eye<00:03:28.330> it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
my lash line but when I open my eye it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.380 
my lash line but when I open my eye it
creates<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.290> perfect<00:03:29.620> curve<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:31.030> your<00:03:31.180> liner

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
creates the perfect curve for your liner

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.750 
creates the perfect curve for your liner
so<00:03:31.900> now<00:03:32.080> you're<00:03:32.230> literally<00:03:32.500> 90%<00:03:32.920> done<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.550> all

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
so now you're literally 90% done and all

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.460 
so now you're literally 90% done and all
you<00:03:33.880> need<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> do<00:03:34.210> is<00:03:34.360> create<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.810> really<00:03:35.200> thin

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
you need to do is create a really thin

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.960 
you need to do is create a really thin
line<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.860> goes<00:03:35.980> from<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.220> inner<00:03:36.370> corner<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
line that goes from the inner corner and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.250 
line that goes from the inner corner and
you<00:03:37.060> want<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:37.330> connect<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.870> line<00:03:38.050> that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
you want to connect it to the line that

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.810 
you want to connect it to the line that
you<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.530> created<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.340> you're<00:03:39.550> pretty<00:03:39.700> much

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
you just created and you're pretty much

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.280 
you just created and you're pretty much
done<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.570> pretty<00:03:40.720> much<00:03:40.840> just<00:03:40.930> want<00:03:41.080> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
done so you pretty much just want to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.900 
done so you pretty much just want to
create<00:03:41.530> really<00:03:41.770> nice<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.160> small<00:03:42.370> strokes<00:03:42.760> and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
create really nice and small strokes and

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.580 
create really nice and small strokes and
it<00:03:43.270> would<00:03:43.360> recommend<00:03:43.780> holding<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.080> pencil<00:03:44.470> on

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
it would recommend holding a pencil on

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.110 
it would recommend holding a pencil on
its<00:03:44.800> side<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.280> way<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.520> makes<00:03:45.670> creating<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
its side that way it makes creating the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.490 
its side that way it makes creating the
lines<00:03:46.300> really<00:03:46.630> nice<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:46.990> easy<00:03:47.110> because<00:03:47.350> if

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
lines really nice and easy because if

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.170 
lines really nice and easy because if
you<00:03:47.590> put<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.070> its<00:03:48.310> point<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:48.910> try<00:03:49.150> and

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
you put it on its point and you try and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.030 
you put it on its point and you try and
draw<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.200> point<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> pencil<00:03:51.010> and

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
draw with the point of the pencil and

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.130 
draw with the point of the pencil and
it's<00:03:51.280> just<00:03:51.460> going<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.730> make<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.120> life<00:03:52.300> look<00:03:53.020> a

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
it's just going to make the life look a

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.610 
it's just going to make the life look a
little<00:03:53.290> shaky<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.960> is<00:03:59.080> what<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.290> eyeliner

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
little shaky so this is what my eyeliner

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.960 
little shaky so this is what my eyeliner
looks<00:03:59.890> like<00:04:00.010> when<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.280> done<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:00.700> course

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
looks like when it's done and of course

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.370 
looks like when it's done and of course
you<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.270> make<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.510> wing<00:04:01.660> as<00:04:01.810> short<00:04:02.170> or<00:04:02.320> as

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
you can make the wing as short or as

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.420 
you can make the wing as short or as
long<00:04:02.740> as<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.100> want

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
long as you want

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.370 
long as you want
I<00:04:03.490> made<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.120> sort<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.450> like<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.750> mid<00:04:05.080> length

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
I made this sort of like a mid length

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.840 
I made this sort of like a mid length
wing<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.190> could<00:04:06.340> sort<00:04:06.460> of<00:04:06.550> get<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
wing just so you could sort of get the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:23.250 
wing just so you could sort of get the
idea<00:04:07.090> of<00:04:07.120> how<00:04:07.210> you<00:04:07.390> do<00:04:07.870> it

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.810 

my<00:04:24.260> eyeliner<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.889> little<00:04:25.220> bit<00:04:25.340> dry<00:04:25.490> today<00:04:25.700> so

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
my eyeliner is a little bit dry today so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.460 
my eyeliner is a little bit dry today so
it<00:04:26.060> made<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.419> little<00:04:26.600> bit<00:04:26.780> more<00:04:26.930> difficult

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
it made it a little bit more difficult

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.590 
it made it a little bit more difficult
to<00:04:27.560> like<00:04:27.860> create<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.700> really<00:04:28.970> nice<00:04:29.120> line<00:04:29.360> like

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
to like create a really nice line like

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.450 
to like create a really nice line like
quickly<00:04:29.990> but<00:04:30.200> if<00:04:30.320> your<00:04:30.500> eyeliner<00:04:30.889> is<00:04:31.040> new<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
quickly but if your eyeliner is new and

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.800 
quickly but if your eyeliner is new and
then<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.639> shouldn't<00:04:31.880> have<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.060> problem<00:04:32.150> so

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
then you shouldn't have a problem so

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.360 
then you shouldn't have a problem so
definitely<00:04:33.169> try<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.650> use<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.830> liquid<00:04:34.100> eyeliner

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
definitely try and use a liquid eyeliner

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.580 
definitely try and use a liquid eyeliner
that<00:04:35.000> has<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> lot<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.810> product<00:04:36.169> left<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:36.470> it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
that has a lot of product left in it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.320 
that has a lot of product left in it
because<00:04:36.770> it'll<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.070> make<00:04:37.250> your<00:04:37.460> job<00:04:37.760> way

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
because it'll just make your job way

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.150 
because it'll just make your job way
easier<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:39.200> once<00:04:39.410> you're<00:04:39.560> done<00:04:39.590> creating<00:04:39.980> your

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
easier so once you're done creating your

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.580 
easier so once you're done creating your
wing<00:04:40.490> each<00:04:40.700> one<00:04:40.910> apply<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> ton<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.720> mascara<00:04:42.260> and

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
wing each one apply a ton of mascara and

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.690 
wing each one apply a ton of mascara and
then<00:04:42.770> you're<00:04:42.889> pretty<00:04:43.010> much<00:04:43.220> done<00:04:43.490> your<00:04:43.669> eye

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
then you're pretty much done your eye

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.260 
then you're pretty much done your eye
look

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
look

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.430 
look
so<00:04:44.389> that's<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:44.780> for<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.930> finished<00:04:45.200> winged

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
so that's it for the finished winged
