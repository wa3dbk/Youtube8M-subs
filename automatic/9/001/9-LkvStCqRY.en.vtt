you're eating the grains and the breads
and<00:03:22.130> after<00:03:22.370> many<00:03:22.940> years<00:03:23.209> even<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.570> vegetarian

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
and after many years even a vegetarian

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.590 
and after many years even a vegetarian
is<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.310> started<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.880> notice<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:26.209> certain

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
is that I started to notice that certain

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.160 
is that I started to notice that certain
grains<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:27.560> eat<00:03:27.769> could<00:03:28.580> make<00:03:28.820> me<00:03:29.170> almost

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
grains I would eat could make me almost

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.199 
grains I would eat could make me almost
fall<00:03:30.470> asleep<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:31.610> think<00:03:31.820> that's<00:03:31.970> why<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.120> lot

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
fall asleep and I think that's why a lot

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.520 
fall asleep and I think that's why a lot
of<00:03:32.360> people<00:03:32.630> come<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.840> raw<00:03:33.110> foods<00:03:33.350> because

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
of people come to raw foods because

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.380 
of people come to raw foods because
after<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.459> finish<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> meal<00:03:34.970> someone
