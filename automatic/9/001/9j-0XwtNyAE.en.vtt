00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
this is a Polaris vector it's kind of a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.180 
this is a Polaris vector it's kind of a
funky<00:00:07.609> looking<00:00:07.970> first<00:00:08.840> try<00:00:09.170> from<00:00:09.500> Polaris<00:00:10.009> in

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
funky looking first try from Polaris in

funky looking first try from Polaris in
the<00:00:10.250> world<00:00:10.429> of<00:00:10.580> electric<00:00:10.969> bikes<00:00:11.210> they've

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
the world of electric bikes they've

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.720 
the world of electric bikes they've
actually<00:00:11.809> launched<00:00:12.320> three<00:00:12.679> bikes<00:00:13.429> they're

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
actually launched three bikes they're

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.320 
actually launched three bikes they're
strive<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.150> Meridian<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.139> vector<00:00:15.500> and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
strive the Meridian and the vector and

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.970 
strive the Meridian and the vector and
you<00:00:17.330> know<00:00:17.420> again<00:00:17.630> with<00:00:17.779> this<00:00:17.900> this<00:00:18.230> funky<00:00:18.710> top

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
you know again with this this funky top

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.189 
you know again with this this funky top
bar<00:00:19.250> I<00:00:19.550> guess<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:20.150> lets<00:00:20.269> you<00:00:20.570> lower<00:00:20.990> your

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
bar I guess that lets you lower your

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.540 
bar I guess that lets you lower your
seat<00:00:21.439> a<00:00:21.470> little<00:00:21.710> bit<00:00:21.830> more<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.279> kind<00:00:22.400> of

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
seat a little bit more and kind of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.040 
seat a little bit more and kind of
create<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:23.140> cruiser<00:00:24.140> feel<00:00:24.590> or<00:00:24.859> something<00:00:25.250> but

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
create a cruiser feel or something but

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.169 
create a cruiser feel or something but
it's<00:00:27.050> also<00:00:27.230> just<00:00:27.500> unique<00:00:27.740> looking<00:00:28.039> all<00:00:28.910> of

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's also just unique looking all of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.150 
it's also just unique looking all of
their<00:00:29.359> bikes<00:00:30.009> at<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:31.340> stage<00:00:31.640> use<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.480> same

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
their bikes at this stage use the same

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.430 
their bikes at this stage use the same
components<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.670> well<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.270> same<00:00:35.690> electronics

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
components and well the same electronics

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.560 
components and well the same electronics
right<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.010> you've<00:00:37.160> got<00:00:37.190> this<00:00:37.430> nice<00:00:37.670> control

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
right so you've got this nice control

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.550 
right so you've got this nice control
box<00:00:38.810> down<00:00:39.110> here<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.650> motor<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.820> then<00:00:41.510> your<00:00:42.110> your

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
box down here a motor and then your your

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.100 
box down here a motor and then your your
your<00:00:43.100> computer<00:00:43.700> right<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.720> throttle

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
your computer right with the throttle

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.010 
your computer right with the throttle
and<00:00:45.200> everything<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.770> I'm<00:00:45.860> gonna<00:00:45.980> walk<00:00:46.340> through

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
and everything so I'm gonna walk through

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.780 
and everything so I'm gonna walk through
specs<00:00:48.020> here<00:00:48.550> now<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.000> 250<00:00:50.960> watt<00:00:51.790> hub

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
specs here now this is a 250 watt hub

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.790 
specs here now this is a 250 watt hub
motor<00:00:53.030> which<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.510> kind<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.050> weak<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> world

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
motor which is kind of weak in the world

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.530 
motor which is kind of weak in the world
of<00:00:54.950> electric<00:00:55.370> bikes<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.000> actually<00:00:56.150> has

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
of electric bikes but it actually has

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.840 
of electric bikes but it actually has
regenerative<00:00:57.500> braking<00:00:58.190> which<00:00:58.460> is<00:00:58.610> pretty

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
regenerative braking which is pretty

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.600 
regenerative braking which is pretty
cool<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:00.590> not<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.800> lot<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.010> electric<00:01:01.430> bikes

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
cool and not a lot of electric bikes

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.070 
cool and not a lot of electric bikes
have<00:01:01.880> that<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.390> know<00:01:02.450> it's<00:01:02.570> kind<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:02.780> nice<00:01:02.900> you

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
have that you know it's kind of nice you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.140 
have that you know it's kind of nice you
put<00:01:03.320> some<00:01:03.650> of<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:03.830> juice<00:01:04.580> back<00:01:04.879> in<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
put some of the juice back in the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.850 
put some of the juice back in the
battery<00:01:05.510> by<00:01:05.750> doing<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.200> whenever<00:01:06.410> you<00:01:06.650> pull

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
battery by doing that whenever you pull

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.930 
battery by doing that whenever you pull
on<00:01:06.980> these<00:01:07.160> brakes<00:01:08.800> but<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:10.220> know<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.550> at<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
on these brakes but you know it at the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.930 
on these brakes but you know it at the
same<00:01:11.090> time<00:01:11.680> 250<00:01:12.680> watts<00:01:13.010> isn't<00:01:13.370> offering<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.820> lot

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
same time 250 watts isn't offering a lot

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.550 
same time 250 watts isn't offering a lot
of<00:01:14.060> power<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.510> just<00:01:14.720> kind<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.020> gives<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.530> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
of power it just kind of gives you a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.410 
of power it just kind of gives you a
little<00:01:15.680> bit<00:01:16.190> of<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.370> boost<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.850> it's<00:01:17.180> kind<00:01:17.390> of

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
little bit of a boost and it's kind of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.800 
little bit of a boost and it's kind of
noisy<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.960> like<00:01:18.080> we're<00:01:18.290> kind<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.280> whines<00:01:19.810> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
noisy it's like we're kind of whines so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.480 
noisy it's like we're kind of whines so
I'm<00:01:20.900> not<00:01:21.020> sure<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:21.350> feel<00:01:21.410> about<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.980> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
I'm not sure how I feel about that the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.900 
I'm not sure how I feel about that the
battery<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.540> lithium<00:01:24.350> battery<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:25.040> 36

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
battery is a lithium battery it's 36

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.510 
battery is a lithium battery it's 36
volt<00:01:26.150> 10<00:01:26.420> amp<00:01:26.570> hour<00:01:26.720> very<00:01:27.260> standard<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.370> nice

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
volt 10 amp hour very standard it's nice

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.370 
volt 10 amp hour very standard it's nice
that<00:01:28.730> it's<00:01:28.850> built<00:01:29.060> into<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> down<00:01:29.540> tube<00:01:29.870> does

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
that it's built into the down tube does

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.870 
that it's built into the down tube does
that<00:01:30.530> distributes<00:01:31.040> weight<00:01:31.220> towards<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
that distributes weight towards the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.149 
that distributes weight towards the
front<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.180> bike<00:01:32.390> why<00:01:33.170> while<00:01:33.830> you've<00:01:34.130> got

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
front of the bike why while you've got

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.940 
front of the bike why while you've got
the<00:01:34.370> weight<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.909> motor<00:01:35.120> on<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.480> rear<00:01:35.950> so

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the weight of the motor on the rear so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.560 
the weight of the motor on the rear so
you<00:01:37.280> know<00:01:37.400> from<00:01:37.640> front<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.030> back<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.390> pretty

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
you know from front to back it's pretty

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.360 
you know from front to back it's pretty
even<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:39.500> you've<00:01:39.710> got<00:01:39.860> one<00:01:39.980> of<00:01:40.070> those<00:01:40.130> bike

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
even if you've got one of those bike

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.649 
even if you've got one of those bike
racks<00:01:40.580> for<00:01:40.730> your<00:01:40.850> car<00:01:41.060> though<00:01:41.240> that's<00:01:41.480> got

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
racks for your car though that's got

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.750 
racks for your car though that's got
like<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> prongs<00:01:42.230> this<00:01:42.920> bikes<00:01:43.159> gonna<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.520> kind

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
like the prongs this bikes gonna be kind

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.219 
like the prongs this bikes gonna be kind
of<00:01:43.820> crooked<00:01:44.180> or<00:01:44.330> something<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.870> so<00:01:44.960> I'm<00:01:45.080> not

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
of crooked or something and so I'm not

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.840 
of crooked or something and so I'm not
sure<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.800> can't<00:01:46.460> get<00:01:46.520> over<00:01:46.580> that<00:01:46.900> bent<00:01:47.900> top<00:01:48.229> bar

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
sure I can't get over that bent top bar

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.800 
sure I can't get over that bent top bar
functionally<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:49.970> works<00:01:50.150> pretty<00:01:50.330> well<00:01:50.450> you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
functionally it works pretty well you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.140 
functionally it works pretty well you
ride<00:01:50.960> along<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.440> got<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.740> front<00:01:52.010> shock<00:01:52.340> very

happened to me more than once and I
don't<00:02:31.350> know<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.470> guess<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.370> turn

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
don't know I guess that's it you turn

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.810 
don't know I guess that's it you turn
the<00:02:32.730> thing<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.230> cycle<00:02:34.650> through

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
the thing on and then you cycle through

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.490 
the thing on and then you cycle through
power<00:02:35.820> assist<00:02:36.300> mode<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.020> three<00:02:37.230> right

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
power assist mode so I'm on three right

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.310 
power assist mode so I'm on three right
now<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.460> go<00:02:38.550> down<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.730> one<00:02:39.000> two<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.720> one

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
now you can go down to one two three one

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
now you can go down to one two three one
two<00:02:40.560> three<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.220> keep<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.550> through

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
two three you just keep going through

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360 
two three you just keep going through
like<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:43.230> then<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.980> start<00:02:44.220> pedaling

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
like that and then you start pedaling

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.210 
like that and then you start pedaling
and<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.450> goes<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.990> I'm<00:02:46.710> gonna<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:47.010> three

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and and it goes so I'm gonna do three

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.990 
and and it goes so I'm gonna do three
because<00:02:47.790> even<00:02:48.210> three<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.600> only<00:02:48.960> barely<00:02:49.350> enough

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
because even three is only barely enough

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:18.490 
because even three is only barely enough
and<00:02:51.950> kind<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> listen<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.760> whine
