life on the device so this will save you
valuable<00:05:36.620> battery<00:05:37.620> life<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.130> can<00:05:38.580> also

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
valuable battery life I can also

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.090 
valuable battery life I can also
optimize<00:05:39.150> individual<00:05:40.050> features<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.860> for

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
optimize individual features so for

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.580 
optimize individual features so for
example<00:05:41.640> if<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.000> am<00:05:42.150> on<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.419> move<00:05:42.570> yeah<00:05:43.230> I<00:05:43.440> can

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
example if I am on the move yeah I can

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.830 
example if I am on the move yeah I can
actually<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:44.100> by<00:05:44.280> turning<00:05:44.730> off<00:05:44.850> Wi-Fi<00:05:45.360> what

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
actually see by turning off Wi-Fi what

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.630 
actually see by turning off Wi-Fi what
I'm<00:05:45.960> gonna<00:05:46.140> gain<00:05:46.470> back<00:05:46.800> in<00:05:46.950> my<00:05:47.070> battery<00:05:47.490> life

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
I'm gonna gain back in my battery life

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.670 
I'm gonna gain back in my battery life
so<00:05:48.180> for<00:05:48.330> example<00:05:48.660> my<00:05:48.810> battery<00:05:49.169> is<00:05:49.200> fairly<00:05:49.500> low

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
so for example my battery is fairly low

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.990 
so for example my battery is fairly low
on<00:05:49.710> this<00:05:49.950> device<00:05:50.250> at<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.490> moment<00:05:50.760> I've<00:05:50.850> only

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
on this device at the moment I've only

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.140 
on this device at the moment I've only
got<00:05:51.180> 20%<00:05:51.570> battery<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:52.560> know<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:53.730> actually<00:05:54.030> by

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
got 20% battery I know that actually by

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.480 
got 20% battery I know that actually by
turning<00:05:54.480> off<00:05:54.600> mobile<00:05:54.960> data<00:05:55.260> is<00:05:55.710> going<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.340> gain

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
turning off mobile data is going to gain

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.780 
turning off mobile data is going to gain
me<00:05:56.669> 11<00:05:57.090> minutes<00:05:57.770> if<00:05:58.770> I<00:05:58.919> turn<00:05:59.160> off<00:05:59.280> Wi-Fi<00:05:59.460> it's

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
me 11 minutes if I turn off Wi-Fi it's

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.270 
me 11 minutes if I turn off Wi-Fi it's
going<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> gave<00:06:00.090> me<00:06:00.270> 7<00:06:00.720> minutes<00:06:01.140> yeah<00:06:01.950> on<00:06:02.160> a

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
going to gave me 7 minutes yeah on a

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.220 
going to gave me 7 minutes yeah on a
device<00:06:02.610> that's<00:06:02.880> got<00:06:03.030> limited<00:06:03.570> battery<00:06:03.840> life

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
device that's got limited battery life

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.080 
device that's got limited battery life
left<00:06:04.470> in<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.800> like<00:06:05.190> this<00:06:05.520> one<00:06:05.580> we're<00:06:05.880> using

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
left in it like this one we're using

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.630 
left in it like this one we're using
right<00:06:06.419> now<00:06:06.710> actually<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:07.890> could<00:06:08.010> be<00:06:08.130> super

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
right now actually that could be super

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.400 
right now actually that could be super
valuable<00:06:08.940> it<00:06:09.150> could<00:06:09.330> be<00:06:09.480> enough<00:06:09.720> just<00:06:10.140> to<00:06:10.260> get

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
valuable it could be enough just to get

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.310 
valuable it could be enough just to get
you<00:06:10.530> home<00:06:10.740> or<00:06:11.090> last<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.330> evening<00:06:12.660> out<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:13.020> can

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
you home or last the evening out I can

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.580 
you home or last the evening out I can
also<00:06:13.440> adjust<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.950> brightness<00:06:14.220> of<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.760> device

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
also adjust the brightness of the device

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.570 
also adjust the brightness of the device
etc<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.800> can<00:06:16.950> look<00:06:17.070> at<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.280> different

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
etc and I can look at the different

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.490 
etc and I can look at the different
settings<00:06:17.820> here<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.390> make<00:06:18.840> decisions<00:06:19.350> on

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
settings here and make decisions on
