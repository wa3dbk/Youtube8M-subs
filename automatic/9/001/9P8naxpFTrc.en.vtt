00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.780 
have one and what I'm basically going to
do<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.130> just<00:00:11.130> widen<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.880> bangs<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.330> bit<00:00:12.540> and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
do is just widen the bangs a bit and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.220 
do is just widen the bangs a bit and
make<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.940> shorter<00:00:15.360> through<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> back<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
make it shorter through the back and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
make it shorter through the back and
longer<00:00:16.770> through<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> front

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
longer through the front

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.330 
longer through the front
I<00:00:17.670> wish<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> front<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.050> longer<00:00:19.619> however

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
I wish the front was longer however

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.689 
I wish the front was longer however
that's<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> weight<00:00:21.750> came<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that's not how the weight came and so

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
that's not how the weight came and so
these<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> things<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.500> could<00:00:25.890> use

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
these are the things that you could use

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.480 
these are the things that you could use
first<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> always<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.019> spray<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.099> spray

first I always like to spray a spray
shine<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.900> helps<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.439> tangles

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
shine and that just helps to get tangles

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
shine and that just helps to get tangles

out of the hair so I'm just going to
spray<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> brush<00:00:36.120> through<00:00:37.820> next<00:00:38.820> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
want to either get a head or put it on

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
want to either get a head or put it on
someone's<00:00:43.530> head<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> make<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> triangle

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
someone's head and make a triangle

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
someone's head and make a triangle
partying<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:46.170> we're<00:00:47.100> gonna<00:00:47.190> make

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
partying in the back we're gonna make

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
partying in the back we're gonna make
sure<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> head<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> slightly<00:00:48.809> bent<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
sure that the head is slightly bent and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.369 
sure that the head is slightly bent and
we're<00:00:50.430> gonna<00:00:50.550> keep<00:00:50.820> taking<00:00:51.090> small<00:00:51.780> triangle

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we're gonna keep taking small triangle

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.630 
we're gonna keep taking small triangle
sections<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.480> make<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> straight<00:00:54.840> line

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
sections and just make a straight line

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
sections and just make a straight line
eventually<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.180> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.780> sure<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.440> as

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
eventually you want to make sure that as

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
eventually you want to make sure that as
you<00:00:58.980> pull<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> triangle<00:00:59.879> sections<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you pull the triangle sections that you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
you pull the triangle sections that you
are<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> over<00:01:02.550> directing<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
are kind of over directing it so that it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.070 
are kind of over directing it so that it
stays<00:01:04.680> long<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> front<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> end

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
stays long in the front so what you end

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
stays long in the front so what you end
up<00:01:07.260> doing<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.680> taking<00:01:07.710> less<00:01:08.400> off<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.450> left

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
up doing is taking less off on the left

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.700 
up doing is taking less off on the left
and<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:10.680> sides<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.320> cut

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and right sides that way you don't cut

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.300 
and right sides that way you don't cut
too<00:01:14.010> much<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> front<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.770> actually<00:01:16.770> didn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
too much off the front I actually didn't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
too much off the front I actually didn't
cut<00:01:17.490> any<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> front<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.740> said

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
cut any off the front because as I said

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
cut any off the front because as I said
prior<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.670> wanted<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> front<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> longer

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
prior I wanted the front to be longer

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
prior I wanted the front to be longer
like<00:01:23.250> Nicki<00:01:23.729> Minaj's<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.840> her<00:01:25.049> hair<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
like Nicki Minaj's I think her hair is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:02:14.970 
like Nicki Minaj's I think her hair is
so<00:01:25.920> cool

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.410 

so<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.040> keep<00:02:16.370> doing<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.850> same<00:02:16.880> thing

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so you keep doing the same thing

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.350 
so you keep doing the same thing
depending<00:02:18.050> upon<00:02:18.200> how<00:02:18.800> thick<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.580> hair<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
depending upon how thick your hair is is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.130 
depending upon how thick your hair is is
how<00:02:20.810> small<00:02:21.230> your<00:02:21.380> sections<00:02:21.890> will<00:02:22.069> be<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:23.140> I'm

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
how small your sections will be and I'm

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.220 
how small your sections will be and I'm
just<00:02:24.319> gonna<00:02:24.560> finish<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> back<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:26.230> then

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
just gonna finish up the back and then

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080 
just gonna finish up the back and then
when<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> incorporate<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> sides<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:29.030> going

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
when I incorporate the sides I'm going

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.290 
when I incorporate the sides I'm going
to<00:02:29.540> definitely<00:02:30.200> over<00:02:30.650> direct<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.090> back

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
to definitely over direct to the back

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.199 
to definitely over direct to the back
line<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:35.319> what<00:02:36.319> we're<00:02:36.500> trying<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.610> work

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
line and what we're trying to do is work

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.780 
line and what we're trying to do is work
from<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.600> back<00:02:38.900> part<00:02:39.340> at<00:02:40.360> an<00:02:41.360> angle<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.610> where

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
from this back part at an angle to where

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.290 
from this back part at an angle to where
this<00:02:44.180> doesn't<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:45.200> cut<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.489> stays<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
this doesn't get cut so that stays the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:03:14.040 
this doesn't get cut so that stays the
same<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.850> part<00:02:50.209> gets<00:02:50.420> cut

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:25.330 

you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.190 

now<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.550> just<00:03:26.730> finishing<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.600> other<00:03:27.810> side

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
now I'm just finishing up the other side

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.160 
now I'm just finishing up the other side
and<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.640> make<00:03:29.850> sure<00:03:30.180> everything<00:03:31.020> is

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.420 

I<00:03:42.060> wish<00:03:42.750> these<00:03:42.960> bangs<00:03:43.320> weren't<00:03:43.830> as<00:03:44.040> short<00:03:44.310> as

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
I wish these bangs weren't as short as

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.830 
I wish these bangs weren't as short as
they<00:03:44.580> were<00:03:44.640> because<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.240> would<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:45.450> left<00:03:45.690> them

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
they were because I would have left them

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.980 
they were because I would have left them
a<00:03:45.930> little<00:03:46.170> bit<00:03:46.290> longer<00:03:46.530> however<00:03:47.490> if<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.690> work

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
a little bit longer however if you work

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.600 
a little bit longer however if you work
with<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:52.160> normally<00:03:53.160> when<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> cut

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
with what you have normally when I cut

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.090 
with what you have normally when I cut
bangs<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.270> do<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.660> in<00:03:54.840> sections<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.890> I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
bangs I do it in sections just like I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.070 
bangs I do it in sections just like I
did<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> back<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:57.150> since<00:03:57.690> these<00:03:57.870> were

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
did the back but since these were

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.140 
did the back but since these were
already<00:03:58.260> cut<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:58.830> just<00:03:59.370> making<00:03:59.700> sure<00:03:59.730> that

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
already cut I'm just making sure that

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.950 
already cut I'm just making sure that
they're<00:04:00.330> straight<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.280> then<00:04:02.280> I'm<00:04:02.460> going<00:04:02.700> to

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
they're straight and then I'm going to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.040 
they're straight and then I'm going to
widen<00:04:03.960> them<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> bit<00:04:04.590> by<00:04:05.480> sectioning<00:04:06.480> off<00:04:06.630> some

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
widen them a bit by sectioning off some

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.810 
widen them a bit by sectioning off some
of<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> hair<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.830> left<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.310> right<00:04:08.520> and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
of the hair on the left and right and

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.760 
of the hair on the left and right and
just<00:04:09.660> making<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.980> line<00:04:11.370> straight<00:04:12.770> following
