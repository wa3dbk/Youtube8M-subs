 [music] 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.389
 Yes 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.330
 ok i finally got a microphone 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.070
 that all my subscribers asked me 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.610
 now i hope my voice case he 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.860
 good and devote today's program 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.470
 for weights and ages guys who 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.619
 I am constantly asked for varieties 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.379
 exercises that can be done on 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.699
 different parts of the body with weights 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.829
 it is clear that all this is limited 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.140
 because not everyone can raise 16 and 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.260
 24 kilograms shake out 2 kilograms 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.340
 weight and do different frills with her but 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.219
 I want to isolate 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.199
 specific muscle group using weights 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.379
 today i will try to do something on 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.090
 biceps 16 kilograms I just 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.920
 tried a few exercises yes 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.199
 really possible but mostly 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.190
 is done 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:05.119
 brachialis is the central bundle of fiber 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 separating triceps and biceps and try 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.450
 make a short short bicep head 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.700
 all I came up with is just two 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.069
 variations first is if we take weights 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.369
 like that Makar is very 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.039
 uncomfortable but what to do then 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.280
 it is brahialis that will train 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.280
 here is 1 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.960
 234 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 five 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.130
 6 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.040
 7 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.980
 eight 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.720
 9 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.760
 there is 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.580
 eleven 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.210
 12 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.510
 3 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.350
 [music] 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.300
 4 means I coached now 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.960
 brachyalis here just this thought 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 whom underdeveloped ligaments it will affect 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.720
 a little bit later because 16 kilograms 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.490
 to warm up is a very big weight 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.070
 accordingly, who has ligaments weakly 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.080
 developed they can get sick in two or three 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.280
 days and then you will have discomfort you will not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.160
 will be able to do what I tell you now 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.730
 He showed no pain is not there 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.660
 OK 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.130
 there are elementary workouts for ligaments 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.770
 which maybe I'll show later 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.050
 and so it was an exercise on brachyialis 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.810
 which can be done 4 sets of 14 and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.660
 16 reps here and the second exercise 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.910
 You can try this with another grip 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.910
 take it like that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.280
 [music] 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.360
 6 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.950
 I sat down then I have a short head 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.950
 biceps outdoor 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:08.180
 9 10 11 12 13 14 frankly at me 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.410
 the chest is tense now and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.959
 of course the press 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.599
 but it all works in statics only 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 biceps only external biceps head 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.739
 short reduced good feeling 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.049
 swoop in goes stress goes good also 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.549
 4 sets of 16 reps I would do 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.840
 so if you do superset 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.790
 let's say as i showed the first to type 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.360
 Alexy second on biceps 4 approach on 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.430
 four 16 reps is very hard 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.110
 not easy therefore let's try 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.730
 super set joint like i just 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:47.730
 once brahialis showed it 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:55.909
 at a pace of 45 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:04:02.090
 six seven eight nine ten times two 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:05.139
 three four now turn over the magnet 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.139
 [music] 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.860
 1314 set rest stretch 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.719
 I usually do this with me 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.719
 there is a mirror here 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.010
 two minutes rest and do three more 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.880
 approach still fucking poured external 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.780
 part of the biceps and barker and I still have 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.290
 the girl I trained for two years 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.200
 beautiful figure great butt beautiful 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.020
 legs nothing extra just muscle in 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.360
 tonus beautiful girl 30 years old and here 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.200
 recently I was told the case came on 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.910
 a gym and some kind of woodpecker 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.190
 plump jock so let's say in which 90 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.580
 percent we have during which other than and 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.740
 wolves probably instead of needles raises 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.690
 picks up needles instead of bars 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.700
 shorter fit does not begin to advise 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.200
 I warm it up constantly between 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.840
 approaches that is, it stretches like 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.660
 I taught two years a girl I recall in 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 great shape are great for you 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.690
 you have to start telling what's not 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.380
 need to stretch between sets this 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.680
 old school 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.170
 yes my friend is old school but it 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.520
 the only correct one is to 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.170
 thoughts remained 108 and supple and 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.660
 beautiful and young 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.420
 if you do not agree continue to prick 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.370
 yourself ass all that college there and not 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.520
