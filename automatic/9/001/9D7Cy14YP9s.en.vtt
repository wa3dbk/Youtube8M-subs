want to point out about the cover hammer

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.189 
want to point out about the cover hammer
breakers<00:00:19.890> they<00:00:20.699> actually<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.900> 10

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
breakers they actually have the 10

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.519 
breakers they actually have the 10
handle<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> black<00:00:24.529> handle

got the color hammer with the black

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
got the color hammer with the black
handle<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> demonstrate<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
handle so I'm going to demonstrate the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
handle so I'm going to demonstrate the
how<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> come

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
how to put this in so I'm going to come

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
how to put this in so I'm going to come
in<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.649> putting<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.430> condenser

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
in we are actually putting a condenser

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
in we are actually putting a condenser
outside<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.590> higher<00:00:46.860> efficient

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
outside and it's a higher efficient

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.450 
outside and it's a higher efficient
condenser<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.860> 40<00:00:50.309> amp

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
condenser so we had to go from a 40 amp

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
condenser so we had to go from a 40 amp
breaker<00:00:50.640> which<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> wire<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> rated

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
breaker which is what this wire is rated

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
breaker which is what this wire is rated
for<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> 40<00:00:53.370> amp<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.640> number<00:00:53.910> eight<00:00:54.030> copper

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
for is 40 amp is number eight copper

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.470 
for is 40 amp is number eight copper
we're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> max<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
we're going to go to a we good to max of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.529 
we're going to go to a we good to max of
30<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> actually<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> 25<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.090> code

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
30 but I actually have a 25 and the code

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.369 
30 but I actually have a 25 and the code
says<00:01:00.840> between<00:01:01.770> 18<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.809> 30<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
says between 18 and 30 so we're going to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.730 
says between 18 and 30 so we're going to
go<00:01:04.470> 25<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:11.990> give<00:01:12.990> me<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> second<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> was

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
go 25 on this one give me a second I was

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:25.560 
go 25 on this one give me a second I was
not<00:01:13.950> prepared<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:35.270 

I'm<00:01:26.020> going<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.229> put<00:01:26.409> this<00:01:26.560> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.120 

and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.940> will<00:01:36.120> redo<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.230> wire<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> for

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and I will redo this wire this is for

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.400 
and I will redo this wire this is for
demonstration<00:01:38.820> purposes<00:01:39.330> only<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.900> lot<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
demonstration purposes only a lot of

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.140 
demonstration purposes only a lot of
times<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> wires<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.940> out

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
times we want to put the wires in on out

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
times we want to put the wires in on out
here<00:01:42.440> basically<00:01:43.440> I'm<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.680> pull<00:01:43.860> these
