00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello everyone welcome to the recipes 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.820
 by Carlos DurÃ³n and we are going to make him a mass 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.759
 for Italian pizza the ingredients that 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.279
 we will need to be 135 grams 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.349
 of flour of force 80 milliliters of 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.349
 Tempered water 4 grams of yeast 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.570
 fresh civilized olli 4 grams of salt 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.710
 although a little to taste and average 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.079
 tablespoon of oil 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.489
 the first step is to break up the 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.489
 fresh yeast in warm water 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.710
 and dissolve it 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.870
 as we do not have enough flour to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.940
 make a volcano directly 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 the water with the yeast 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 the half a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.240
 and simply with a spoon what 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.240
 we mix a little 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 we add the salt 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 an opportunity that we have a mass 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.270
 homogeneous we took it out of the bowl and started 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 to knead on the countertop if we see that it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.690
 hit us we can sprinkle a little 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.960
 of flour but in principle it is not 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 necessary because it does not stick and there 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 that to spend about 10 minutes and in the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.740
 key to knead well is to squeeze 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.170
 make strength with this part of the hand 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.050
 it's worth it so we're doing a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.050
 circle and let's squeeze 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.750
 What we want is for the mass to be the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.750
 more homogeneous possible and that is elastic 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.320
 another way more to mass is to take the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.409
 put it like this or the way it is with 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.920
 this hand arrays this part and with the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.170
 other 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.720
 you have to stretch it 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.720
 it comes back together and you do it again 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.500
 at the beginning when you do 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.600
 can break evils I'm going to do a lot 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.080
 Once it may break but is normal 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.930
 because we still did not give it to him 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 enough electricity but after 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.060
 the 56 minutes of kneading you will see that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 when you do this, it's not going to break 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.770
 for nothing if you have a mass now in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.050
 house and you did not want to give them the beating of 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.960
 be ten minutes kneading the can 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 knead without any problem the rotisserie 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.900
 Well, we have about nine minutes 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.910
 kneading the dough and the truth that already 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.930
 so we advance much softer a lot 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.829
 more elastic for example let's do 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.829
 just kind too 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 it does not come out perfect 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.390
 We will continue advancing until we reach 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.030
 the 10 minutes good as well as 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.970
 we took about ten minutes kneading 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.250
 we give ball shape 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.890
 we lay a little hand and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.430
 we put it 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.640
 to the dough and put it in a bowl that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.290
 we have also previously cited 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.290
 and we cover it with transparent film 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.580
 let's let the dough rest or more 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.440
 half an hour until doubled 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.960
 volume is important that we leave it 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.330
 rest in a quality zone if we are 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.090
 in winter we can leave it next to the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.250
 radiator or inside the oven without lighting 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.830
 and if we are in summer then simply 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.200
 the kitchen is worth what is important 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.920
 a good quality zone because the mass already 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.450
 has rested a half hour and well then 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.450
 as you see has doubled its size 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.010
 Well, the problem we're going to do 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.010
 will be to remove the goal 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.020
 Y 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.599
 let's spend a tad we try anything 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.700
 practically nothing just to take away the 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.550
 air 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.860
 as we have already reduced and we are going to do 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.459
 a little ball we have to make a little ball 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.459
 perfect 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.730
 a person that we have a little ball 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.730
 perfect let's study flour 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.820
 we figure the ball above 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.870
 what we are going to do is going to be the most 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.460
 high with the roller when we have more 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.889
 or less a base like that because now we're going 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.259
 to put on non-stick paper and 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.780
 we already know pretty good so that 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.950
 do not go totally round what 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.950
 we have to do is going to be 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.950
 yes 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.390
 backwards 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 as for the cults sides 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 diagonal 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.120
 and again and we repeat the teacher a 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.000
 back to back 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.340
 achieved our patronage for another 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.060
 diagonally 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.980
 and in improving there are many types of dough and 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.740
 the Italian is characterized because it has 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.419
 a very thin dough that adorns the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.199
 order them so it stays very crispy 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.120
 That's why the goal is to make the dough 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.410
 as thin as possible we will put it on top 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.410
 of paper before meaning 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.189
 well then when we have it on 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.669
 of paper here in baking paper 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:38.740
 we are going to continue advancing and after that 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.740
 already have it here is that we can 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.779
 do as fine as possible at the end 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.819
 as we want because then we are not going to 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.710
 have to move the tray is already the 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.120
 accident paper issue then no 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.069
 we have that after it breaks 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.580
 the passion here already as we have it 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.080
 so big roll we can not make it from 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.120
 part back for the protein - 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.699
 because in addition it is only already 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.759
 we have to go better and we have to 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.610
 hit it with the roller and go see more or 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.080
 unless it does not go round well 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.020
 we already have the base for pizza 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.479
 Italian list you try three finite is 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.659
 round we go did not come out perfect is that a 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.590
 put the ingredients and usually the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.140
 we have to water at 250 degrees 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.169
 about 10 minutes but good depends on 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.930
 what we do 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.340
 It has a time and a temperature I'm going 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.069
 to leave in the description different 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.319

 little related to this topic because with 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.129
 the description can also leave me
