we<00:00:01.979> need<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.340> meet<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.520> new<00:00:02.760> constraint<00:00:03.360> and

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
we need to meet a new constraint and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.390 
we need to meet a new constraint and
that<00:00:04.740> constraint<00:00:05.370> has<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.690> co<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.529> co

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
that constraint has to do with co to co

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.620 
that constraint has to do with co to co
2<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:09.320> warming<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> planet<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:12.150> equation

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
2 is warming the planet and the equation

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.110 
2 is warming the planet and the equation
on<00:00:12.750> co2<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.620> actually<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> very

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
on co2 is actually a very

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080 
on co2 is actually a very
straightforward<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.800> sum<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
straightforward one if you sum up the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.040 
straightforward one if you sum up the
co2<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.470> gets<00:00:19.740> emitted<00:00:20.300> that<00:00:21.300> leads<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
co2 that gets emitted that leads to a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.320 
co2 that gets emitted that leads to a
temperature<00:00:22.410> increase<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.189> that

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
temperature increase and that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.029 
temperature increase and that
temperature<00:00:24.330> increase<00:00:24.750> leads<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.710> some<00:00:25.890> very

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
temperature increase leads to some very

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
temperature increase leads to some very
negative<00:00:26.340> effects<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.599> effects<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
negative effects the effects on the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740 
negative effects the effects on the
weather<00:00:28.820> perhaps<00:00:29.820> worse<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.359> indirect

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
weather perhaps worse the indirect

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.560 
weather perhaps worse the indirect
effects<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.279> natural<00:00:32.820> ecosystems

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
effects in that the natural ecosystems

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
effects in that the natural ecosystems
can't<00:00:33.840> adjust<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.559> these<00:00:34.680> rapid<00:00:35.160> changes<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
can't adjust to these rapid changes and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.080 
can't adjust to these rapid changes and
so<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.690> ecosystem<00:00:37.680> collapses<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so you get ecosystem collapses now the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900 
so you get ecosystem collapses now the
exact<00:00:39.629> amount<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.350> how<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> map<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
exact amount of how you map from a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
exact amount of how you map from a
certain<00:00:42.420> increase<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.170> co2<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.399> what

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
certain increase in of co2 to what

certain increase in of co2 to what
temperature<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> where<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
temperature will be and where the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.540 
temperature will be and where the
positive<00:00:46.620> feedbacks<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.190> there's<00:00:47.489> some

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
positive feedbacks are there's some

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.299 
positive feedbacks are there's some
uncertainty<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
uncertainty there but not very much and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
uncertainty there but not very much and
there's<00:00:51.090> certainly<00:00:51.420> uncertainty<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.230> how

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there's certainly uncertainty about how

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439 
there's certainly uncertainty about how
bad<00:00:52.890> those<00:00:53.129> effects<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.300> will

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bad those effects will be but they will

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
bad those effects will be but they will
be<00:00:54.510> extremely<00:00:54.960> bad<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:56.180> asked<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> top

scientists<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:58.260> several<00:00:58.440> times<00:00:58.770> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
scientists and there's several times do

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
scientists and there's several times do
we<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.969> down<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.899> near<00:01:01.109> zero

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
we really have to get down to near zero

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.770 
we really have to get down to near zero
can't<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:02.789> cut<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.270> half<00:01:03.329> or

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can't we just you know cut it in half or

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
can't we just you know cut it in half or
a<00:01:03.809> quarter<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.860> answer<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.549> until

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a quarter and the answer is that until

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350 
a quarter and the answer is that until
we<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.479> near<00:01:07.170> 20<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.610> temperature<00:01:09.150> will

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
we get near 20 the temperature will

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
we get near 20 the temperature will
continue<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> rise<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
continue to rise and so that's that's a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
continue to rise and so that's that's a
big<00:01:12.060> challenge<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.810> very<00:01:12.960> different<00:01:13.500> than

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
big challenge it's very different than

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.070 
big challenge it's very different than
saying<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.760> we're<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> 12-foot<00:01:15.869> high

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
saying you know we're a 12-foot high

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
saying you know we're a 12-foot high
truck<00:01:16.470> trying<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.950> under<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> ten<00:01:17.460> foot

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

truck trying to get under a ten foot
bridge<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.360> sort<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> squeeze

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bridge and we can just sort of squeeze

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.090 
bridge and we can just sort of squeeze
under<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.470> has<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.950> get

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
under this is something that has to get

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.780 
under this is something that has to get
20<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.369> carbon

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
20 now we put out a lot of carbon

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.399 
20 now we put out a lot of carbon

for each American it's about 20 tons for
people<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.369> poor<00:01:35.549> countries<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.150> less<00:01:36.360> than

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
people in poor countries it's less than

people in poor countries it's less than
one<00:01:36.750> ton<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.619> average<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.220> five<00:01:38.549> tons

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
one ton it's an average about five tons

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.960 
one ton it's an average about five tons
for<00:01:39.840> everyone<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> planet<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.250> somehow

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
for everyone on the planet and somehow

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.840 
for everyone on the planet and somehow
we<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.689> changes<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.549> bring

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
we have to make changes that will bring

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.350 
we have to make changes that will bring
that<00:01:45.119> down<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> zero<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.729> constantly

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that down to zero it's been constantly

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.219 
that down to zero it's been constantly
going<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.439> only<00:01:49.770> various<00:01:50.610> economic

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
going up it's only various economic

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.539 
going up it's only various economic
changes<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> even<00:01:52.920> flattened<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> at

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
changes that have even flattened it at

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999 
changes that have even flattened it at
all<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.360> from<00:01:54.540> rapidly<00:01:55.439> rising

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
all so we have to go from rapidly rising

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.280 
all so we have to go from rapidly rising
to<00:01:56.670> falling<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.390> falling<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to falling and falling all the way to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.340 
to falling and falling all the way to
zero<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.640> equation<00:02:00.210> has<00:02:00.329> four<00:02:00.630> factors<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
zero this equation has four factors a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
zero this equation has four factors a
little<00:02:02.130> bit<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> multiplication<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.659> you've

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
little bit of multiplication so you've

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.690 
little bit of multiplication so you've
got<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.960> thing<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> Left<00:02:04.920> co2<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
got a thing on the Left co2 that you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
got a thing on the Left co2 that you
want<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> zero<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
want to get to zero and that's going to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
want to get to zero and that's going to
be<00:02:08.099> based<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.090> number<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> people<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
be based on the number of people the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.820 
be based on the number of people the
services<00:02:11.400> each<00:02:11.940> person's<00:02:12.569> using<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.050> average

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
services each person's using on average

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.310 
services each person's using on average
the<00:02:14.220> energy<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.940> average<00:02:15.870> for<00:02:16.020> each<00:02:16.050> service

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the energy on average for each service

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.270 
the energy on average for each service
and<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.220> co2<00:02:17.550> being<00:02:18.180> put<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.900> per<00:02:19.680> unit<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and the co2 being put out a per unit of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
and the co2 being put out a per unit of
energy<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.330> let's<00:02:21.540> look<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:21.870> each<00:02:21.990> one<00:02:22.020> of

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
energy so let's look at each one of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.220 
energy so let's look at each one of
these<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.790> how<00:02:24.270> we<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.020> down

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
these and see how we can get this down

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.070 
these and see how we can get this down
to<00:02:25.530> zero<00:02:26.090> probably<00:02:27.090> one<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> these<00:02:27.510> numbers<00:02:27.720> is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to zero probably one of these numbers is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.010 
to zero probably one of these numbers is
going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.590> get<00:02:28.710> pretty<00:02:28.980> near<00:02:29.250> 20

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
going to have to get pretty near 20

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.410 
going to have to get pretty near 20
that's<00:02:31.160> back<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:32.400> high<00:02:32.550> school<00:02:32.820> algebra<00:02:33.000> but

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that's back from high school algebra but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.110 
that's back from high school algebra but
let's<00:02:33.600> let's<00:02:33.930> take<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> look<00:02:34.730> first<00:02:35.730> we've<00:02:35.940> got

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
let's let's take a look first we've got

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.290 
let's let's take a look first we've got

reproductive health services we could

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.380 
reproductive health services we could
lower<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.950> by<00:02:50.130> perhaps<00:02:50.460> ten<00:02:50.940> or<00:02:51.030> fifteen

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.800 
lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen
percent<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.800> see<00:02:52.980> an<00:02:53.070> increase<00:02:53.520> of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
percent but there we see an increase of
