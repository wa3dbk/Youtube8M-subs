00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:08.670
 for a new video tips then I 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.269
 will show you how I put my 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 stamping plates then you will need 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.000
 just one to how is it called a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.130
 pocket for storing photos in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.519
 do it here 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.599
 and so it looks like this so 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.700
 either you take to the waist directly 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 here I do not know if it exists but 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.550
 I did like those see here and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 I cut the edges but of course for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.860
 not that it opened on the sides 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 in fact I use this device there 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 so the story of this device is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 that actually two years ago actually when 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.719
 I still lived at my grandmother's 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.020
 we did 1 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.879
 and then I had taken him to make a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 other tip that I will show you in 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.260
 another video with these and we have it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.030
 lost and in fact I was looking for all the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 time I had looked on the internet I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 longer knew the name I was typing that soda 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 you go to the body to he gave me 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.110
 stuff to blow in to put 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 under vacuum and actually there as by chance 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.340
 last week I thought I 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.500
 may be watching again 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.259
 on the internet if I find one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 had ordered 1 last year and in 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.720
 done on priceminister and it's me 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 never arrived I had paid 5 euros and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.579
 few briefs has never happened I 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 asked the seller 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.290
 here he has never answered me so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 I gave up doing it and then there the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.079
 last week I told myself he 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.390
 should I look I will test 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.000
 under all names 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.020
 to see if I find a penny of bag ap 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.600
 it's actually I found them all 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.159
 stupidly at pearl selestat so they 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.470
 have a site I will put you in the bar 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.390
 info to order on the net but 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.880
 I'm lucky to have a pearl at 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.470
 next to my house so I took my 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.670
 little car and cottages have searched 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.700
 two they are not quite worth 5 euros 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 and then it works battery-powered batteries 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.350
 are not provided with 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.720
 and in fact by contact it will melt the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.720
 plastic and you will be able to slide 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:39.470
 and melt it all so I'm going to I 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:42.230
 am going to ask is actually to tidy up my 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 stamping blocks I simply bought 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.660
 of a photo support here is like you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 want if you do not have the device 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.480
 you can take a photo support and 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.900
 do not melt leave as it is me 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.900
 I preferred to melt it so I'm going 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.269
 to show you on a page I take my 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 page I simply take the penny 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.049
 bag 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:17.739
 I take the measure that it is necessary 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.739
 and I just drag it like this 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.579
 that's it and so it's massoud and it's me 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.230
 drunk there the side you see it's more 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.200
 we can not go that far 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.840
 really fused weld and the rest 1 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.750
 I cut with a chisel to make 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.030
 that's how my little pocket is 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.359
 and at least the plates are not scratched they 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.310
 have their front and back and then you 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.590
 can choose 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.260
 here are your dishes like that so I have my 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.389
 small stamping plate binder because 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.919
 that I still counted on acquiring 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.459
 others because it's true that on the 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:03.169
 site is joly there are some very 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.939
 pretty it was out of stock 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.709
 when I wanted to order them and they 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.209
 receive within 30 days so the month 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.760
 next I think I'll redo myself 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.430
 a small stock of standing and it was necessary 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.950
 really a storage and there it is the top 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.870
 it just fell well here I hope that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.959
 my little trick will have pleased you 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.820
 all links are in info bar and 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.820
 I make you very big kisses ciao
