00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.350
 and we aim and see him do what happens 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.870

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.769

 I do not know why it does not happen to me there but what 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.800
 I'll say it's a sand 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.599
 the caves and all that but what not 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.770
 understand is why no peace because there 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.770
 it serves me on the floor 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.900
