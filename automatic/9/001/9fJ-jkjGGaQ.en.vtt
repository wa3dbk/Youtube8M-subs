 alone in the darkness of the word all this horror was 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.670
 created explicitly after reading the books of howard 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.409

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.000
 the games their motives and goals are different but the essence 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.190
 games remain unchanged so you can 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 choose anyone it will not affect 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.670
 course of events 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.320

 Blazhkovich fighter carries brave alone 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.660
 trash the enemy troops and gets to 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:49.030
 Adolf Hitler himself who by the way is not 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.490
 as simple as expected if you 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.100
 interesting then let's say this Hitler 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.630

 This sequel comes in three episodes 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.639
 related about them should not 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.710
 talk separately count them 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.389

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.010
 who started a chemical war in general 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.440
 pretty interesting shot to 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.710
 one 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.230
 ramazh in 60 levels but hardly anyone 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.650
 play all 60 because there are some among them 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.250
 hidden secret levels though in general 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.290

 actions forward to victory 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.310
 push what is called fascists and if 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.440
 seriously, we all recommend this 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.080
 moment this is one of the best shooters if 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.570
 none of the best games at all 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.250
 as you spend less time 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:58.280
