00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
it's kind of like showing off something

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.629 
it's kind of like showing off something
cool<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> discovered<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.070> also<00:00:11.219> kind<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
cool I discovered but it's also kind of

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.580 
cool I discovered but it's also kind of
like<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.820> tutorial<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.929> let<00:00:13.019> me<00:00:13.110> show<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.440> what

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
like a tutorial so let me show you what

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.270 
like a tutorial so let me show you what
I<00:00:13.650> discovered

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
I discovered

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.710 
I discovered
so<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> basically<00:00:14.849> created<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:16.520> little<00:00:17.720> teleport

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so I basically created a little teleport

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.439 
so I basically created a little teleport
thingy<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.400> someone<00:00:20.400> accurate<00:00:21.210> well<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
thingy that someone accurate well it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.150 
thingy that someone accurate well it
doesn't<00:00:21.600> accurately<00:00:21.869> teleport<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
doesn't accurately teleport you but it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
doesn't accurately teleport you but it
teleports<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.720> similar<00:00:25.439> direction

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
teleports you in the similar direction

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.060 
teleports you in the similar direction
to<00:00:25.949> where<00:00:26.070> you're<00:00:26.250> looking<00:00:27.650> somewhat<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to where you're looking somewhat but it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.780 
to where you're looking somewhat but it
can't<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.660> down<00:00:31.640> necessarily<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
can't go up and or down necessarily and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.440 
can't go up and or down necessarily and
you<00:00:32.850> need<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.630> enclosed<00:00:33.800> area<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
you need to be in an enclosed area and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.979 
you need to be in an enclosed area and
there's<00:00:36.450> fewer<00:00:36.690> bugs<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.649> basically<00:00:38.899> here<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
there's fewer bugs but basically here it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.010 
there's fewer bugs but basically here it
is<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.040> gonna<00:00:41.190> look<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:41.430> there

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
is so I'm gonna look over there

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.299 
is so I'm gonna look over there
boom<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.719> over<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:47.160> can

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
boom I'm in here I was over there we can

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.560 
boom I'm in here I was over there we can
start<00:00:47.820> over<00:00:48.000> let's<00:00:48.719> start<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:50.510> and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.540 

this<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> good<00:00:55.140> spot<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> then

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this should be a good spot and then

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
this should be a good spot and then
let's<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:59.600> let's<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.960> where<00:01:01.350> we

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
let's go over there let's see where we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's go over there let's see where we
aren't<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> didn't<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.370> far<00:01:02.670> but

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
aren't all that didn't go very far but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
aren't all that didn't go very far but
basically<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.070> go

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
basically what it is is you can go

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.810 
basically what it is is you can go
pretty<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:05.700> anywhere<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:08.580> by

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
pretty much anywhere you look just by

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.289 
pretty much anywhere you look just by
pressing<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.479> button<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.180> see

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
pressing a button but see as you can see

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.039 
pressing a button but see as you can see
it<00:01:12.390> gets<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.840> off<00:01:14.090> but<00:01:15.090> that's<00:01:15.420> alright<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it gets a bit off but that's alright so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.710 
it gets a bit off but that's alright so
here's<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> command<00:01:17.340> block<00:01:17.549> let<00:01:17.880> me<00:01:18.000> move<00:01:18.659> my

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
here's the command block let me move my

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.890 
here's the command block let me move my
hand<00:01:19.020> off<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.909> this<00:01:20.909> basically<00:01:21.390> uses

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
hand off of this and this basically uses

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.859 
hand off of this and this basically uses
item<00:01:22.830> attributes<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.420> here's<00:01:24.630> where<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
item attributes so here's where the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
item attributes so here's where the
tutorial<00:01:25.380> comes<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> um<00:01:27.920> I'm<00:01:28.920> sure<00:01:29.009> most

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
tutorial comes in so um I'm sure most

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.260 
tutorial comes in so um I'm sure most
people<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
people know that you can do this and I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
people know that you can do this and I
I'm<00:01:33.869> sure<00:01:34.110> most<00:01:34.259> people<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I'm sure most people know how to do it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
I'm sure most people know how to do it
as<00:01:35.220> well<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.329> haven't<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.659> seen<00:01:36.780> any

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
as well but I haven't really seen any

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
as well but I haven't really seen any
videos<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.799> confused<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.310> how<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> do

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
videos and I was confused on how to do

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.359 
videos and I was confused on how to do
it<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.750> had<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> hard<00:01:40.170> time<00:01:40.229> figuring<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it so it had a hard time figuring out so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.719 
it so it had a hard time figuring out so
here<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> /give<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.520> at

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
here it is so we do a /give and then at

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.800 
here it is so we do a /give and then at
player<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.240> whatever<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:46.909> 350<00:01:47.909> 45<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
player or whatever you want 350 45 is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.609 
player or whatever you want 350 45 is
the<00:01:48.930> compass<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.079> believe<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the compass and then one I believe is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.940 
the compass and then one I believe is
amount<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> 0<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> data<00:01:54.420> value<00:01:54.899> value<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
amount and 0 is the data value value and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.720 
amount and 0 is the data value value and
then<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.170> attribute<00:01:58.340> modifiers<00:01:59.340> and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
then we do attribute modifiers and

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.340 
then we do attribute modifiers and
the<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.330> capitalized<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.050> M<00:02:02.170> is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the a is capitalized the M is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.810 
the a is capitalized the M is
capitalized<00:02:02.850> :<00:02:04.230> square<00:02:05.230> brackets<00:02:05.890> curly

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
capitalized : square brackets curly

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.470 
capitalized : square brackets curly
brackets<00:02:07.920> attribute<00:02:08.920> name<00:02:09.280> make<00:02:09.730> sure<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
brackets attribute name make sure a and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.360 
brackets attribute name make sure a and
n<00:02:10.660> are<00:02:10.690> capitalized<00:02:13.350> quotation<00:02:14.350> :<00:02:14.860> quotation

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
n are capitalized quotation : quotation

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.480 
n are capitalized quotation : quotation
marks<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.910> then<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.400> a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
marks and then you can do one of a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.080 
marks and then you can do one of a
number<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.150> different<00:02:20.760> attributes

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
number of different attributes

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.130 
you'll figure it out we're gonna do
generic<00:02:32.050> dot<00:02:33.300> movement<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.510> make<00:02:34.660> sure<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.960> S

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
generic dot movement and make sure the S

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
generic dot movement and make sure the S
is<00:02:35.440> capitalized<00:02:35.860> nothing<00:02:36.190> else<00:02:36.340> in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the same thing as here I'm not sure if

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.390 
the same thing as here I'm not sure if
this<00:02:47.290> does<00:02:47.560> anything<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:50.890> not<00:02:51.040> sure<00:02:51.220> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
this does anything but I'm not sure and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.140 
this does anything but I'm not sure and
the<00:02:51.820> new<00:02:51.940> comma<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.600> then<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> amount<00:02:53.410> :<00:02:54.310> 50

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
the new comma and then you amount : 50

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.290 
the new comma and then you amount : 50
and<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.460> plenty<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.490> make<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.880> go<00:02:58.030> fast

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
and that is plenty to make you go fast

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.620 
and that is plenty to make you go fast
but<00:02:58.630> if<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.830> did<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.250> one<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:01.000> wouldn't<00:03:01.330> go<00:03:01.480> as

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
but if I did like one it wouldn't go as

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.630 
but if I did like one it wouldn't go as
fast<00:03:01.900> as<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.500> or<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.460> I'm<00:03:03.610> sure

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
fast as that or you know and I'm sure

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.850 
fast as that or you know and I'm sure
hungry<00:03:04.180> might<00:03:04.330> make<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.930> faster<00:03:05.440> an

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
hungry might make you going faster an

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.650 
hungry might make you going faster an
operation<00:03:06.850> zero<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:08.760> believe<00:03:09.760> if<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.630> remember

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
operation zero I believe if I remember

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.770 
operation zero I believe if I remember
correctly<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:12.550> makes<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.330> negative<00:03:13.480> or

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
correctly it makes it negative or

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.390 
correctly it makes it negative or
positive<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> can't<00:03:15.400> remember<00:03:15.780> how<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
positive but I can't remember how and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.729 
positive but I can't remember how and
then<00:03:18.400> finally<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.480> want<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.660> put<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.020> UUID

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
then finally you want to put in UUID

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.910 
then finally you want to put in UUID
least<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.060> most<00:03:22.870> I'm<00:03:23.290> not<00:03:23.440> sure<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.770> these

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
least and most I'm not sure what these

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.810 
least and most I'm not sure what these
do<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.550> need<00:03:24.820> them<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.830> just<00:03:26.830> I've

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
do but you need them I just I've

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.280 
do but you need them I just I've
actually<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.540> didn't<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.959> supposed<00:03:29.200> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
actually I didn't know you supposed to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.680 
actually I didn't know you supposed to
put<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.310> found<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.630> a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
put this in and I found this in on a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.570 
put this in and I found this in on a
website<00:03:31.989> where<00:03:32.770> they<00:03:32.860> told<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.190> how<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.340> do

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
website where they told you how to do

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.030 
website where they told you how to do
that<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:35.050> I'm<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.170> using<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.620> numbers<00:03:35.890> they

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that so I'm just using the numbers they

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.590 
that so I'm just using the numbers they
used<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.670> could<00:03:36.850> probably<00:03:37.000> use<00:03:37.209> any<00:03:37.390> number

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
used you could probably use any number

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.870 
used you could probably use any number
you<00:03:37.720> want<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.560> I'll<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.459> command<00:03:39.700> down

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
you want but I'll have this command down

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.850 
you want but I'll have this command down

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
the description and then you end your

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.320 
the description and then you end your
curly<00:03:42.070> brackets<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.640> your<00:03:42.760> square<00:03:42.970> brackets

and<00:03:43.450> your<00:03:43.600> curly<00:03:43.870> brackets<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.380> there<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.100> go

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
and your curly brackets and there you go

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.930 
and your curly brackets and there you go
you<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.459> your<00:03:46.080> custom<00:03:47.080> item<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.340> if<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.670> hold

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.210 
you have your custom item so if you hold
it<00:03:49.090> or<00:03:49.270> if<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.570> like<00:03:49.690> armor<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.800> can<00:03:50.920> put<00:03:51.100> it

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
it or if it's like armor you can put it

it or if it's like armor you can put it
on<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.900> it'll<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:55.120> if<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.360> put<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.630> on

on and it'll and then if you put it on

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.470 
on and it'll and then if you put it on
it'll<00:03:55.930> happen<00:03:56.320> anyways<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.700> it's<00:03:57.880> plus<00:03:58.150> see<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
it'll happen anyways so it's plus see it

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.949 
it'll happen anyways so it's plus see it
says<00:03:58.690> plus<00:03:59.050> 50<00:03:59.380> speed<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.030> yeah<00:04:01.030> but<00:04:01.840> one

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
says plus 50 speed and yeah but one

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.160 
says plus 50 speed and yeah but one
thing<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.230> want<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.380> be<00:04:02.440> careful<00:04:02.830> about<00:04:03.010> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
thing you want to be careful about is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.619 
thing you want to be careful about is
let's<00:04:05.170> see<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:06.010> doing

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
let's see is doing

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.220 
let's see is doing
this<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.829> we're<00:04:10.980> gonna<00:04:11.069> go<00:04:11.250> over<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.230> I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
this so we're gonna go over here and I

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.219 
this so we're gonna go over here and I
guess<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.829> don't<00:04:13.950> mind<00:04:14.220> losing<00:04:14.489> this<00:04:14.700> world<00:04:15.229> it

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
guess I don't mind losing this world it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.180 
guess I don't mind losing this world it
makes<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.590> go<00:04:16.799> flying<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.130> see

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
makes you go flying so as you can see

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.580 
makes you go flying so as you can see
I've<00:04:20.489> gone<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.329> rendered<00:04:21.660> chunk<00:04:21.959> one

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
I've gone out of the rendered chunk one

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.469 
I've gone out of the rendered chunk one
although<00:04:22.889> this<00:04:23.280> can<00:04:23.460> be<00:04:23.550> very<00:04:23.910> glitchy<00:04:24.180> one

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
although this can be very glitchy one

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.689 
although this can be very glitchy one
time<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.289> world<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.710> was<00:04:25.949> not<00:04:26.550> even
