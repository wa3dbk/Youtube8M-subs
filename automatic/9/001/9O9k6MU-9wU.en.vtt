00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hello, 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 In 1816, the Scotsman Robert Stirling created his first engine. 

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:23.000
 This is one of the first industrial engines. 

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:30.007
 It was subsequently displaced by the steam engine due to insufficient technology for its production. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 This prototype was originally made with a smaller diameter work / cylinder / cylinder. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 After the first experiment, it was replaced by another, larger diameter. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.589
 In this case, from f22 to f45, at stroke of the piston 15mm. 

00:00:51.671 --> 00:01:00.552
 Logically larger diameter leads to greater torque and efficiency. 

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:06.000
 So that the plunger area is essential. 

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:13.985
 The piston is made of graphite due to the low coefficient of friction and the low density of 1.7 grams. With this variant of the piston, a cast iron segment with a thickness of 0.8 mm was installed. 

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:19.429
 The display seal is also made of graphite. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 The display is made of textolite because the density of the textolite is 1.4g / cm3 and was the lightest material I have. 

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:33.935
 Turned by 2 parts and milled so as to form a cavity, 

00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:44.000
 i. the removal of material in the interior for lightening. / For details, see my YouTube / 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 The flywheel is attached to 2 bearings mounted side by side one-sided. 

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.591
 Transmitting motion from the piston to the display 

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:08.680
 is made again with two rolling bearings. 

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:21.000
 The course of the display is 12 mm. The compression ratio has not measured it, but it is probably below the unit. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.785
 Subsequently, I increased the stroke of the piston to 22mm, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 as a result of which the torque increases. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.300
 Do not underestimate the plots or the cross section of the plunger because the kinetic impulse is small. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 In addition, I can say that I was experimenting with a display made of aluminum. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 The result was that the engine under the same conditions showed worse results! 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.435
 High thermal conductivity material is not suitable for display. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.435
 Success!
