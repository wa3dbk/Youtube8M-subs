it's really good especially for their
first<00:02:16.910> project<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.560> once<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.830> day<00:02:18.980> for

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
first project but I once a day for

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.070 
first project but I once a day for
project<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> didn't<00:02:19.940> make<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.209> MMA<00:02:20.900> game

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
project and it didn't make a MMA game

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.729 
project and it didn't make a MMA game
but<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.160> UFC<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.150> pretty<00:02:23.540> good<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.170> wish

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
but for UFC it's just pretty good I wish

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.140 
but for UFC it's just pretty good I wish
they<00:02:24.890> had<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.400> don't<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:25.640> about<00:02:25.940> which

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
they had it I don't think about which

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.630 
they had it I don't think about which
they<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.450> have<00:02:26.570> more<00:02:26.750> was<00:02:26.930> uh<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.280> reverse

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
they can have more was uh the reverse

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.220 
they can have more was uh the reverse
transitions<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.510> think<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:29.930> reverse

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
transitions I think you could reverse

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.320 
transitions I think you could reverse
them<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:30.500> i'm<00:02:30.590> not<00:02:30.739> sure<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.820> can<00:02:31.850> reverse

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
them but i'm not sure if you can reverse

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.990 
them but i'm not sure if you can reverse
them<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:33.080> crazy<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.190> i<00:02:34.700> wish<00:02:34.850> they

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
them is not like crazy and i wish they

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.370 
them is not like crazy and i wish they
still<00:02:35.150> had<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.390> cage<00:02:35.660> control<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.230> know
