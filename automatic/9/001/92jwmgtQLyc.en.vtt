how<00:00:00.420> you<00:00:00.570> do<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:01.140> wanted<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.709> make<00:00:01.890> an<00:00:02.040> updated

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
how you do I wanted to make an updated

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.940 
how you do I wanted to make an updated
version<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> wind<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.319> mechanical

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
version of how to wind a mechanical

watch<00:00:05.100> as<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:06.299> can<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:06.629> here<00:00:07.940> it<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.000> not

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
watch as you can see here it is not

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.830 
watch as you can see here it is not
currently<00:00:09.690> running<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:11.300> this<00:00:12.300> particular

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
currently running on this particular

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.369 
currently running on this particular
model<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.679> where<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> spring<00:00:14.730> would

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
model you can see where the spring would

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.890 
model you can see where the spring would
compress<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> wind<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> not<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
compress as you wind it and it is not of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
compress as you wind it and it is not of
the<00:00:19.140> screw<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.619> kind<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.820> means<00:00:20.970> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the screw down kind so that means you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.380 
the screw down kind so that means you
can<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.240> pull<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.230> change<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> time

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
can just pull it out to change the time

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
can just pull it out to change the time
but<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.439> how<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> wind<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but first let's go on how to wind it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.540 
but first let's go on how to wind it
depending<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.810> model<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> watch<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
depending on the model of the watch the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
depending on the model of the watch the
amount<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.510> times<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> rotate<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
amount of times you want to rotate it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500 
amount of times you want to rotate it
may<00:00:31.800> change<00:00:32.099> depending<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> power

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
may change depending on the power

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
may change depending on the power
reserve<00:00:34.160> some<00:00:35.160> might<00:00:35.399> even<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.820> multiple

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
reserve some might even have multiple

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.040 
reserve some might even have multiple
barrels<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.860> springs<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.930> run

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
barrels of the springs so it can run

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
barrels of the springs so it can run
longer<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> generally<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.750> turn<00:00:43.170> until

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
longer so generally you just turn until

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
longer so generally you just turn until
it<00:00:43.739> doesn't<00:00:44.010> want<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> turn<00:00:44.460> anymore<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it doesn't want to turn anymore and if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
it doesn't want to turn anymore and if
you<00:00:45.510> keep<00:00:45.840> turning<00:00:46.079> after<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.309> you'll

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you keep turning after that then you'll

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.130 
you keep turning after that then you'll
break<00:00:47.789> it

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
break it

00:00:48.140 --> 00:01:14.649 
break it
so<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.350> sweating

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.709 

see<00:01:15.290> now<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.680> doesn't<00:01:15.860> want<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.159> try<00:01:16.280> anymore

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
see now it doesn't want to try anymore

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.010 
see now it doesn't want to try anymore
let's<00:01:17.719> sleep<00:01:17.869> we'll<00:01:18.049> focus<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:18.619> on<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:20.020> you

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
let's sleep we'll focus in on that you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.920 
let's sleep we'll focus in on that you
can<00:01:21.110> see<00:01:21.350> here<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:23.390> spring<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.899> compressed

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
can see here the spring is compressed

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.630 
can see here the spring is compressed
and<00:01:24.710> fully<00:01:25.460> well<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:27.799> will<00:01:27.920> continue<00:01:28.399> wide

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
and fully well it will continue wide

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.749 
and fully well it will continue wide
this<00:01:31.640> particular<00:01:32.329> model<00:01:32.720> does<00:01:33.159> have<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.429> screw

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
this particular model does have a screw

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.010 
this particular model does have a screw
down<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.179> in<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.539> case<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.110> would<00:01:36.229> unwind<00:01:37.220> it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
down so in this case you would unwind it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.740 
down so in this case you would unwind it
unscrew<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.259> start<00:01:42.740> popped<00:01:43.100> out<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
unscrew it and you start popped out and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.480 
unscrew it and you start popped out and
this<00:01:44.750> particular<00:01:45.409> model<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:46.100> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this particular model is of the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.210 
this particular model is of the
automatic<00:01:46.880> kind<00:01:47.349> so<00:01:48.349> for<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.799> kind<00:01:49.099> of

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
automatic kind so for this kind of

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.520 
automatic kind so for this kind of
winding<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.810> not<00:01:51.259> really<00:01:51.500> necessary

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
winding it is not really necessary

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.669 
winding it is not really necessary
unless<00:01:52.399> it's<00:01:52.640> 100%<00:01:53.060> dead<00:01:53.599> and<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.349> just<00:01:54.500> want

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
unless it's 100% dead and you just want

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.679 
unless it's 100% dead and you just want
to<00:01:54.709> wind<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.099> little<00:01:55.340> bit<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.420> give<00:01:59.599> it<00:01:59.659> a

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
to wind it a little bit and give it a

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.559 
to wind it a little bit and give it a
little<00:01:59.810> kick<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:00.679> then<00:02:00.770> I'll<00:02:00.890> start<00:02:01.189> running

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
little kick and then I'll start running

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.699 
little kick and then I'll start running
and<00:02:02.569> then<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.929> set<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.259> time<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.500> date

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
and then you can set the time and date

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.080 
and then you can set the time and date
and<00:02:04.209> then<00:02:05.950> I'll<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.220> keep<00:02:07.399> charging<00:02:07.610> itself

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
and then I'll just keep charging itself

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
and then I'll just keep charging itself
throughout<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.479> day

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.020 

so<00:02:22.400> we'll<00:02:22.490> be<00:02:22.580> fully<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:24.520> we<00:02:25.520> have<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.790> one

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so we'll be fully in we have this one

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.520 
so we'll be fully in we have this one
because<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.420> does<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> screw<00:02:27.200> down<00:02:27.320> if

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
because it does not have a screw down if

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.350 
because it does not have a screw down if
it<00:02:27.770> was<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> screw<00:02:28.430> down<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.700> would<00:02:28.790> unscrew<00:02:29.150> it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
it was a screw down you would unscrew it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.930 
it was a screw down you would unscrew it
and<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:30.620> will<00:02:30.680> come<00:02:31.040> out<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.760> can

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and it will come out and then you can

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:43.350 
and it will come out and then you can
wind<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.270> from<00:02:32.450> there

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.720 

thanks<00:02:43.570> for<00:02:43.660> watching
