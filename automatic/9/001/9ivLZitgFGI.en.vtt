 Let 's take lx of the truck car 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.950
 I will comment on the pitch 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.830
 Lx point of this release is the first in the lx series 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:05.980
 Equipped with a solid cover will be released 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:09.319
 Solid cover makes the knit lanes strongly responsive and stable to carry in the pocket 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.439
 Performance was achieved 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.659
 I think that this lx point is the best in the thickest 0 among the series using face steel 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:21.459
 Also increases by all means everyone like 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.459
 Try lx points 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.180
