00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
one mark is equal to one round and these

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
one mark is equal to one round and these
those<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.390> Roman<00:00:54.840> numerals<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> two<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
those are just Roman numerals the two is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.760 
those are just Roman numerals the two is
equal<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.760> five<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.360> equal<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> five

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
equal to two the five is equal to five

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.170 
equal to two the five is equal to five
those<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.489> Roman<00:00:59.820> numerals

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
those are all just like Roman numerals

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.389 
those are all just like Roman numerals
same<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.590> had<00:01:01.710> five<00:01:02.010> marks

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
same so that if I just had five marks

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
same so that if I just had five marks
that<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.699> mean<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.329> highest<00:01:03.480> round<00:01:03.809> I've

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that would mean the highest round I've

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
that would mean the highest round I've
gotten<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.500> five<00:01:04.799> rounds<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.489> anyways

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
gotten to was five rounds but anyways

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
gotten to was five rounds but anyways
the<00:01:06.630> e<00:01:06.659> bone<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.229> worth<00:01:07.409> five<00:01:08.010> rounds<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the e bone is worth five rounds the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
the e bone is worth five rounds the
skeleton<00:01:09.450> head<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> worth<00:01:10.470> fifteen<00:01:11.100> rounds

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
skeleton head is worth fifteen rounds

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
skeleton head is worth fifteen rounds
and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.119> blue<00:01:12.360> eyes<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:12.990> attached<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and the blue eyes if that's attached to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.160 
and the blue eyes if that's attached to
the<00:01:14.250> skeleton<00:01:14.520> eyes<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.570> extra<00:01:15.840> five

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the skeleton eyes that's an extra five

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.649 
the skeleton eyes that's an extra five
rounds<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> top<00:01:18.240> right

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
rounds so if you look at the top right

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
rounds so if you look at the top right
skeleton<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> my<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:21.000> current<00:01:21.360> ranking

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
skeleton which is my my current ranking

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.190 
skeleton which is my my current ranking
I<00:01:22.110> guess<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.560> say<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.540> had<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> skeleton

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I guess you could say I had the skeleton

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.859 
I guess you could say I had the skeleton
which<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.560> fifteen<00:01:26.100> rounds<00:01:26.310> plus<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.600> blue

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
which is fifteen rounds plus the blue

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
which is fifteen rounds plus the blue
eyes<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.409> five<00:01:28.680> rounds<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.490> we're

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
eyes which are five rounds so now we're

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.020 
eyes which are five rounds so now we're
at<00:01:29.729> twenty<00:01:30.180> rounds<00:01:30.350> plus<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.799> five<00:01:32.189> marks<00:01:32.759> at

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
at twenty rounds plus the five marks at

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850 
at twenty rounds plus the five marks at
the<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.450> top<00:01:33.659> left<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> equal<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the very top left which is equal to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
the very top left which is equal to
twenty<00:01:35.100> five<00:01:35.250> rounds<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> means<00:01:36.540> my

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
twenty five rounds so that means my

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100 
twenty five rounds so that means my
heist<00:01:37.170> zombies<00:01:38.009> round<00:01:38.490> score<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.450> whatever<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
heist zombies round score or whatever is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
heist zombies round score or whatever is
equal<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> twenty<00:01:41.070> five<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.899> that's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
equal to twenty five so you know that's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
equal to twenty five so you know that's
pretty<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.399> person<00:01:44.729> below<00:01:45.119> me<00:01:45.360> if

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
pretty good but the person below me if
