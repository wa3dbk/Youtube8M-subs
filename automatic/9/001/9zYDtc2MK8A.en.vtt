minor scale is the open position I've

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
minor scale is the open position I've
already<00:00:22.470> showed<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> guys<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> minor<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
already showed you guys the a minor and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
already showed you guys the a minor and
I<00:00:24.660> told<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> flat<00:00:25.439> three<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.949> six

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
I told you it's a flat three and a six

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300 
I told you it's a flat three and a six
and<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> seven<00:00:26.490> flat<00:00:27.330> 3<00:00:27.599> flat<00:00:27.779> 6<00:00:28.199> flat<00:00:28.289> 7<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and a seven flat 3 flat 6 flat 7 off the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.330 
and a seven flat 3 flat 6 flat 7 off the
major<00:00:29.519> scale<00:00:30.560> that's<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> formula<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.219> make

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
major scale that's the formula to make

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.360 
major scale that's the formula to make
the<00:00:32.460> minor<00:00:32.669> scale<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:34.370> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the minor scale think of it that way so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
the minor scale think of it that way so
we're<00:00:35.520> gonna<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.880> B<00:00:36.090> minor<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:44.480> open<00:00:45.480> position
