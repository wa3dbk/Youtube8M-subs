down<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.210> sights<00:02:18.360> about<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> same<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.560> same

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
down the sights about the same the same

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.870 
down the sights about the same the same
damage<00:02:21.410> see<00:02:22.410> what<00:02:22.560> else<00:02:22.710> we<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> pest

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
damage see what else we got on the pest

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.190 
damage see what else we got on the pest
control<00:02:23.910> matrix<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.930> lightweight

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
control matrix if you have lightweight

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380 
control matrix if you have lightweight
so<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.770> give<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.310> boost<00:02:26.550> your

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so if you give that it will boost your

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.140 
so if you give that it will boost your
movement<00:02:28.050> speed<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:29.130> bit<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.760> all

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
movement speed a little bit I have all

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.790 
movement speed a little bit I have all
armor<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:30.750> lightweight<00:02:30.990> helps<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> little

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
armor so lightweight helps out a little

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.060 
armor so lightweight helps out a little
bit<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.880> have<00:02:32.910> speed<00:02:33.540> reload<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:34.890> will

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
bit do we have speed reload so we will

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.520 
bit do we have speed reload so we will
do<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> reload<00:02:35.790> without<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.300> speed<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.350> there's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
do a reload without the speed so there's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.550 
do a reload without the speed so there's
a<00:02:37.620> reload<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.870> turn<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.200> speed

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
a reload and then if we turn on speed

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.430 
a reload and then if we turn on speed
reload<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.460> fast<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.910> goes<00:02:42.320> now<00:02:43.320> my

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
reload and see how fast it goes now my

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.090 
reload and see how fast it goes now my
gloves<00:02:43.710> don't<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.130> auto<00:02:44.340> rifle<00:02:44.700> reload<00:02:45.030> so

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
gloves don't have auto rifle reload so

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.260 
gloves don't have auto rifle reload so
pretty<00:02:47.100> good<00:02:47.250> bump<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> speed<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.000> there<00:02:48.180> on

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
pretty good bump to speed right there on

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.620 
pretty good bump to speed right there on
your<00:02:48.300> reload<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.070> have<00:02:50.390> small<00:02:51.390> bore

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
your reload then we have small bore

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
your reload then we have small bore
actually<00:02:52.080> use<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> lot<00:02:52.530> because<00:02:52.770> it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
actually use this a lot because it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
actually use this a lot because it
increases<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.400> range<00:02:53.640> instability<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> will

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
increases the range instability it will

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
increases the range instability it will
give<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> smaller<00:02:55.470> magazine<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.100> make<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
give you a smaller magazine to make a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.000 
give you a smaller magazine to make a
little<00:02:56.459> bit<00:02:56.670> harder<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.000> reload<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.860> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
little bit harder to reload but that is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.060 
little bit harder to reload but that is
ok<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> prefer<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.540> gun<00:03:00.920> because<00:03:01.920> if

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
ok I prefer it on this gun because if

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.290 
ok I prefer it on this gun because if
you<00:03:02.190> aim<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.520> sights<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> little

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
you aim down the sights and go a little

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.490 
you aim down the sights and go a little
longer<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:03.989> bit<00:03:04.140> better<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
longer you get a little bit better of a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.860 
longer you get a little bit better of a
shot<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:05.120> found<00:03:06.120> myself<00:03:06.239> aiming<00:03:06.720> down<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
shot I found myself aiming down the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.900 
shot I found myself aiming down the
sights<00:03:06.930> Holden<00:03:07.380> aye<00:03:07.440> hip<00:03:07.590> fire<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.070> do<00:03:08.130> when

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
sights Holden aye hip fire but I do when

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.160 
sights Holden aye hip fire but I do when
I<00:03:09.000> remember<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.570> has<00:03:09.810> hip<00:03:09.989> fire

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I remember that this has hip fire

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900
