Dean Ambrose what's new on him I think

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.970 
Dean Ambrose what's new on him I think
it<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:35.019> shirt<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.840> patch<00:02:38.049> as<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.829> can

there<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.709> his<00:02:45.340> shirt<00:02:45.609> nothing<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> back

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
there on his shirt nothing on the back

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.089 
there on his shirt nothing on the back
black<00:02:47.440> shirt<00:02:47.680> cool<00:02:48.459> crunch<00:02:49.380> ab<00:02:50.380> crunch<00:02:50.859> it's

kind<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.400> tight<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.180> figure

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
kind of tight on this figure

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.180 
kind of tight on this figure
I<00:02:52.690> wonder<00:02:53.049> why<00:02:54.900> Dean<00:02:55.900> Ambrose<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.709> master

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.610 
I wonder why Dean Ambrose is the master
I<00:02:57.400> want<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.239> know<00:02:58.359> but<00:02:58.660> he<00:02:58.840> doesn't<00:02:59.109> have<00:02:59.440> it

I want to know but he doesn't have it
written<00:03:00.160> there<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> might<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.060> do<00:03:01.180> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
written there I might have to do a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.500 
written there I might have to do a
custom<00:03:01.810> mod<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.349> make<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.579> Dean<00:03:03.579> Ambrose<00:03:04.030> master

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
hair color was better I know he doesn't

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.569 
hair color was better I know he doesn't
have<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.739> weird<00:03:21.269> paint<00:03:22.269> on<00:03:22.859> his<00:03:23.859> chin<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:26.019> huh

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
he has weird eyebrows right here I will

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.990 
he has weird eyebrows right here I will
pause<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.260> show<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.680> what<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.130> magic<00:03:33.790> of

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
pause and show you what the magic of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.839 
pause and show you what the magic of
Photoshop<00:03:34.799> what<00:03:35.799> he<00:03:35.889> could<00:03:36.069> look<00:03:36.190> like<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.609> the

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
Photoshop what he could look like if the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.330 
Photoshop what he could look like if the
eyebrows<00:03:37.389> were<00:03:37.780> different<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.650> think<00:03:38.889> this<00:03:39.220> is

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
eyebrows were different I think this is

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.159 
eyebrows were different I think this is
better<00:03:39.519> or<00:03:39.639> do<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.090> think<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.510> worse<00:03:40.900> let

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
better or do you think it is worse let

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.199 
better or do you think it is worse let
me<00:03:41.260> know<00:03:41.379> in<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.560> comments<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:43.090> can

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
me know in the comments and as you can

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.729 
me know in the comments and as you can
see<00:03:43.269> when<00:03:43.629> comparing<00:03:44.169> them<00:03:44.410> they<00:03:44.560> are

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
see when comparing them they are

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.610 
see when comparing them they are
relatively<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.910> same<00:03:46.299> figure<00:03:47.019> from<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
relatively the same figure from the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.410 
relatively the same figure from the
bottom<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.269> shirt<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.609> head

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
bottom it is just the shirt and the head

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.970 
bottom it is just the shirt and the head
so<00:03:52.990> what<00:03:53.110> do<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.230> guys<00:03:53.319> think<00:03:53.380> which<00:03:53.740> is<00:03:53.860> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
so what do you guys think which is the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.360 
so what do you guys think which is the

better Dean Ambrose elite let me know in

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.390 
better Dean Ambrose elite let me know in
the<00:03:57.400> comments<00:03:58.060> what<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.360> guys<00:03:58.390> think<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.110> think

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
the comments what you guys think I think

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.650 
the comments what you guys think I think
personally<00:04:00.400> they<00:04:00.940> both<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.480> their

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
personally they both have their

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.460 
personally they both have their
strengths<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.290> their<00:04:02.380> weaknesses

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
strengths and their weaknesses

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
strengths and their weaknesses
I'd<00:04:05.470> say<00:04:05.800> neither<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.310> them<00:04:06.459> is<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.940> perfect

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
I'd say neither of them is the perfect

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.320 
I'd say neither of them is the perfect
Dean<00:04:08.050> Ambrose<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.890> here<00:04:09.520> we<00:04:09.640> go<00:04:09.790> how<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.120> he

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
Dean Ambrose and here we go how is he

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.870 
Dean Ambrose and here we go how is he
going<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.570> hold<00:04:10.810> this<00:04:11.020> camcorder<00:04:11.550> people<00:04:12.550> say

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
he holds it like this that's dumb

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.699 
he holds it like this that's dumb
who<00:04:16.959> holds<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.380> camcorder<00:04:17.940> upside<00:04:18.940> down<00:04:19.709> for

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
who holds a camcorder upside down for

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.909 
who holds a camcorder upside down for
one<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.250> holds<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.090> by<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.270> screen<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.050> know<00:04:23.530> I

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
one and holds it by the screen I know I

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.480 
one and holds it by the screen I know I
don't

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
don't

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.580 
don't
so<00:04:24.790> uh<00:04:24.820> let's<00:04:25.600> see<00:04:25.780> if<00:04:25.900> he<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.110> hold<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.410> any

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
so uh let's see if he can hold it any

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.580 
so uh let's see if he can hold it any
other<00:04:26.680> way<00:04:27.160> oh<00:04:27.870> maybe<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.169> like<00:04:29.350> that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
other way oh maybe it's like that

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.250 
other way oh maybe it's like that
because<00:04:29.980> he<00:04:30.100> films<00:04:30.460> himself<00:04:30.520> like<00:04:31.300> this<00:04:31.510> yeah

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
because he films himself like this yeah

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.780 
because he films himself like this yeah
that's<00:04:32.500> probably<00:04:32.770> yet<00:04:33.480> so<00:04:34.480> I'm<00:04:34.990> Dean<00:04:35.260> Ambrose
