to do this so I'm going to keep

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.699 
to do this so I'm going to keep
repeating<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> same<00:02:21.010> workout<00:02:21.430> until<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.790> can

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
repeating the same workout until I can

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.229 
repeating the same workout until I can
do<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.920> two<00:02:24.610> 10-minute<00:02:24.940> intervals

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
do the two 10-minute intervals

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.729 
do the two 10-minute intervals
back-to-back<00:02:28.239> because<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.810> next<00:02:29.050> workout

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
back-to-back because the next workout

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.150 
back-to-back because the next workout
that<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.140> couch<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.770> 5k<00:02:32.950> program

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that I have in this couch to 5k program

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.710 
that I have in this couch to 5k program
is<00:02:33.730> run<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.180> 25<00:02:34.540> minutes<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.150> believe<00:02:37.510> this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
is run for 25 minutes and I believe this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.509 
is run for 25 minutes and I believe this
the<00:02:37.900> last<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> last<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> interval

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
the last is the last of the interval

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.790 
the last is the last of the interval
workouts<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.110> last<00:02:41.319> interval

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
workouts so this is the last interval

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.370 
workouts so this is the last interval
workout<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.459> need<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.850> like<00:02:43.510> master<00:02:44.170> this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
workout so I need to like master this

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.170 
workout so I need to like master this
workout<00:02:44.800> before<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.250> move<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> next<00:02:45.880> one

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
workout before I move on to the next one

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.320 
workout before I move on to the next one
I<00:02:47.010> guess<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.160> main<00:02:48.370> problem<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.060> have

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
I guess the main problem that I have

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.539 
I guess the main problem that I have
with<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.660> couch<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.470> 5k<00:02:50.650> program<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
with this couch to 5k program is that it

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.100 
with this couch to 5k program is that it
um<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:54.160> doesn't<00:02:54.400> really<00:02:54.670> set<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> workouts<00:02:55.569> in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
um it doesn't really set the workouts in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:04.710 
um it doesn't really set the workouts in
like<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:57.959> progressive<00:02:59.910> succession<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.690> a

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
like a progressive succession it's not a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.470 
like a progressive succession it's not a
gradual<00:03:05.410> progression<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:07.630> cases<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.940> I'm

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
gradual progression in some cases so I'm

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.440 
gradual progression in some cases so I'm
just<00:03:11.470> really<00:03:12.459> want<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.640> master<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.090> workout

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
just really want to master this workout

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.410 
just really want to master this workout
