hey how's it going guys kris here and in

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.299 
hey how's it going guys kris here and in
this<00:00:09.990> video<00:00:10.200> i'll<00:00:10.559> show<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.830> all<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
this video i'll show you all the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.560 
this video i'll show you all the
different<00:00:11.400> weapon<00:00:11.910> sites<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.330> you'll<00:00:12.450> be

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
different weapon sites that you'll be

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.089 
different weapon sites that you'll be
able<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.809> attach<00:00:13.080> onto<00:00:13.349> your<00:00:13.590> guns<00:00:13.860> in

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
able to attach onto your guns in

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.950 
able to attach onto your guns in
battlefield<00:00:14.610> hardline<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.809> look

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
battlefield hardline and how they look

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
battlefield hardline and how they look
whilst<00:00:16.170> they're<00:00:16.350> being<00:00:16.529> used<00:00:16.859> I'll<00:00:17.789> go<00:00:17.940> over

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
whilst they're being used I'll go over

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
whilst they're being used I'll go over
all<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> close-range<00:00:18.900> optics<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.590> begin<00:00:19.890> with

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
all the close-range optics to begin with

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.759 
all the close-range optics to begin with
so<00:00:20.699> first<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> iron<00:00:21.779> sights<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so first up is the iron sights use the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.320 
so first up is the iron sights use the
weapons<00:00:23.100> built<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.519> iron<00:00:23.880> sights

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
weapons built in iron sights

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.060 
weapons built in iron sights
everyone<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.470> these<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> come

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
everyone pretty much has these and come

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.560 
everyone pretty much has these and come
with<00:00:26.220> them<00:00:26.340> built<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.880> them<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.300> won't

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with them built into them so you won't

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
with them built into them so you won't
have<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> buy<00:00:27.930> these<00:00:27.990> though<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:28.890> look

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
have to buy these though they will look

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
have to buy these though they will look
different<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.490> each<00:00:29.640> gun<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> bit

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
different on each gun some are a bit

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.830 
different on each gun some are a bit
more<00:00:31.349> obstructive<00:00:31.920> than<00:00:32.130> others<00:00:32.480> X<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
more obstructive than others X is the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080 
more obstructive than others X is the
reflex<00:00:34.469> red<00:00:35.100> dot<00:00:35.130> sight<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> bright

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
reflex red dot sight with a bright

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
reflex red dot sight with a bright
aiming<00:00:36.480> point<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> clear<00:00:37.380> sight<00:00:37.649> picture<00:00:38.070> for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
aiming point and clear sight picture for

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.190 
aiming point and clear sight picture for
rapid<00:00:38.579> target<00:00:38.969> acquisition<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.719> tracking

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
rapid target acquisition and tracking

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
rapid target acquisition and tracking
now<00:00:40.770> although<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.190> says<00:00:41.399> red<00:00:41.670> dot<00:00:41.940> sight<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
now although it says red dot sight it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
now although it says red dot sight it
actually<00:00:42.719> lies<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
actually lies and it's more like a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
actually lies and it's more like a
yellow<00:00:44.190> triangle<00:00:44.610> sight<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.660> triangle<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
yellow triangle sight the triangle is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.080 
yellow triangle sight the triangle is
quite<00:00:46.379> big<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.950> could<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.520> harder<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
quite big so it could be a bit harder to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 
quite big so it could be a bit harder to
be<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.390> accurate<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.930> range<00:00:49.399> then<00:00:50.399> there's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
be more accurate at range then there's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
be more accurate at range then there's
the<00:00:50.820> Cobra<00:00:51.239> rush<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> reflex<00:00:52.260> sight<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the Cobra rush and reflex sight with a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
keeps the point of aim clear now this is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
keeps the point of aim clear now this is
