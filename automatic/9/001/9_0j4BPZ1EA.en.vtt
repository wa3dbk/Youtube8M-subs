00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
one of the first things you want to do

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.060 
one of the first things you want to do
when<00:00:13.789> you<00:00:13.879> first<00:00:14.180> come<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:14.449> a<00:00:14.570> route<00:00:15.199> stream<00:00:15.590> is

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
when you first come to a route stream is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.620 
when you first come to a route stream is
determine<00:00:16.640> whether<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:16.940> have<00:00:17.119> surface

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
determine whether you have surface

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.050 
determine whether you have surface
activity<00:00:17.960> or<00:00:18.260> not<00:00:18.470> today<00:00:19.189> I'm<00:00:19.400> not<00:00:19.550> seeing<00:00:19.910> any

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
activity or not today I'm not seeing any

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.120 
activity or not today I'm not seeing any
surface<00:00:20.510> activity<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.410> what<00:00:21.589> I'm<00:00:21.710> going<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:21.949> do

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
surface activity so what I'm going to do

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.620 
surface activity so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:22.310> I'm<00:00:22.429> going<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.609> start<00:00:22.880> on<00:00:22.999> the<00:00:23.119> bottom<00:00:23.480> of

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
is I'm going to start on the bottom of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.689 
is I'm going to start on the bottom of
the<00:00:23.779> river<00:00:23.929> I'm<00:00:24.169> going<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.380> use<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.589> nymph<00:00:24.919> which

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
the river I'm going to use a nymph which

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.060 
the river I'm going to use a nymph which
I<00:00:25.820> have<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:25.999> generic<00:00:26.390> nymph<00:00:26.720> here<00:00:27.019> with<00:00:27.769> a<00:00:27.800> piece

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
I have a generic nymph here with a piece

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.519 
I have a generic nymph here with a piece
of<00:00:28.099> split<00:00:28.460> shot<00:00:28.759> and<00:00:29.029> way<00:00:29.960> up<00:00:30.109> on<00:00:30.259> the<00:00:30.289> other

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
of split shot and way up on the other

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.920 
of split shot and way up on the other
end<00:00:30.769> here<00:00:31.009> I<00:00:31.039> have<00:00:31.429> a<00:00:31.460> strike<00:00:32.029> indicator<00:00:32.570> I'm

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
end here I have a strike indicator I'm

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.300 
end here I have a strike indicator I'm
gonna<00:00:33.200> try<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.500> get<00:00:33.650> down<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.130> bottom

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
gonna try to get down to the bottom

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.610 
gonna try to get down to the bottom
that's<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.180> beginning<00:00:35.600> now<00:00:35.960> as<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:36.380> see

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's the beginning now as I see

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.979 
that's the beginning now as I see
surface<00:00:37.100> activity<00:00:37.430> begin<00:00:37.969> then<00:00:38.420> I'll<00:00:38.539> change

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
surface activity begin then I'll change

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:50.889 
surface activity begin then I'll change
my<00:00:39.260> rig<00:00:39.469> up<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.859> either<00:00:40.190> an<00:00:48.100> emergen<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:50.600> two

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
my rig up to either an emergen is two

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.930 
my rig up to either an emergen is two
currents<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.620> called<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.949> seam<00:00:52.219> you

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
currents here it's called the seam you

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.200 
currents here it's called the seam you
got<00:00:53.090> fast<00:00:53.420> water<00:00:53.949> meeting<00:00:54.949> slow<00:00:55.250> water<00:00:55.550> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
got fast water meeting slow water and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.029 
got fast water meeting slow water and
what<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.570> causes<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.379> spot<00:00:57.739> where<00:00:57.949> the

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
what that causes is a spot where the

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.040 
what that causes is a spot where the
fish<00:00:58.280> will<00:00:58.489> lay<00:00:58.670> where<00:00:59.059> it's<00:00:59.179> almost<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.809> void

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
fish will lay where it's almost a void

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.079 
fish will lay where it's almost a void
it<00:01:00.710> doesn't<00:01:01.100> take<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.219> whole<00:01:01.309> lot<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.640> energy

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
it doesn't take a whole lot of energy

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.450 
it doesn't take a whole lot of energy
for<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.359> fish<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.750> lay<00:01:02.929> there<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:04.339> is

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
for the fish to lay there so this is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.950 
for the fish to lay there so this is
where<00:01:04.610> I'm<00:01:04.699> going<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.910> place<00:01:05.030> my<00:01:05.150> fly<00:01:05.600> along

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
where I'm going to place my fly along

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.220 
where I'm going to place my fly along
the<00:01:06.110> scene<00:01:06.410> right<00:01:07.190> along<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:07.760> I'm<00:01:08.060> gonna<00:01:08.960> try

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
the scene right along here I'm gonna try

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.830 
the scene right along here I'm gonna try
to<00:01:09.260> dead<00:01:09.619> drift<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.509> follow<00:01:11.509> along<00:01:11.659> with

to dead drift it and follow along with

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.060 
to dead drift it and follow along with
the<00:01:12.079> rod<00:01:12.259> tip<00:01:14.290> it's<00:01:15.290> important<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.770> keep<00:01:15.920> the

the surface it's as important to have a
drag<00:01:24.500> free<00:01:24.829> drift<00:01:25.100> when<00:01:25.280> fishing<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.670> nymph<00:01:25.880> as

drag free drift when fishing a nymph as
it<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:26.600> when<00:01:26.810> fishing<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.200> dry<00:01:27.409> fly<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:30.460> think<00:01:31.460> I

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
it is when fishing a dry fly I think I

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.310 
it is when fishing a dry fly I think I
might<00:01:31.850> put<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.180> little<00:01:32.240> more<00:01:32.570> weight<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.930> here<00:01:33.140> I

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
might put a little more weight on here I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.749 
might put a little more weight on here I
don't<00:01:33.439> think<00:01:33.649> I'm<00:01:33.890> quite<00:01:34.159> making<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.670> the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
don't think I'm quite making it to the

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.139 
don't think I'm quite making it to the
bottom<00:01:34.909> fast<00:01:35.270> enough<00:01:36.790> use<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.939> minimum

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
bottom fast enough use the minimum

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.300 
bottom fast enough use the minimum
amount<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.780> split<00:01:39.049> shot<00:01:39.320> or<00:01:39.530> wait<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.040> get<00:01:40.159> your

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
fly down too much and you will

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.260 
fly down too much and you will
continuously<00:01:42.770> hang<00:01:43.040> up<00:01:43.189> on<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.399> bottom<00:01:43.729> too
