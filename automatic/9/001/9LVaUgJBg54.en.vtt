devices 1280 x 720 p your screen super
amoled<00:02:05.790> plus<00:02:05.869> obviously<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.649> curd

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
amoled plus obviously and the curd

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.660 
amoled plus obviously and the curd
thingy<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.750> totally<00:02:10.470> insane<00:02:10.709> how

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
thingy that's that's totally insane how

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.540 
thingy that's that's totally insane how
it<00:02:11.730> looks

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
it looks

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.850 
it looks
and<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.570> battery<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.020> mean<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.410> would<00:02:14.620> love<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
and the battery I mean we would love to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.830 
and the battery I mean we would love to
see<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.160> big<00:02:15.340> batteries<00:02:15.820> 17<00:02:16.830> 1750<00:02:17.830> milliamps<00:02:18.840> at

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
see a big batteries 17 1750 milliamps at

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.350 
see a big batteries 17 1750 milliamps at
1600<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.980> kid<00:02:21.310> already<00:02:21.460> knows<00:02:21.760> my<00:02:21.970> galaxies

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
1600 and I kid already knows my galaxies

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.240 
1600 and I kid already knows my galaxies
to<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.710> battery<00:02:24.100> drains<00:02:24.520> pretty<00:02:25.450> quick

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
to that the battery drains pretty quick

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.270 
to that the battery drains pretty quick
so<00:02:27.780> yeah<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.560> want<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.920> bigger<00:02:30.100> battery

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
so yeah you we want a bigger battery

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.260 
so yeah you we want a bigger battery
equal<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.870> yeah<00:02:32.230> they<00:02:32.800> should<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.700> made<00:02:34.150> it

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
equal so yeah they should have made it

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.730 
equal so yeah they should have made it
bigger<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:35.100> yeah<00:02:36.100> hopefully<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.210> will<00:02:37.510> work

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
bigger but yeah hopefully it will work

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.410 
bigger but yeah hopefully it will work
but<00:02:38.740> according<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.160> these<00:02:39.250> new<00:02:39.580> rumors<00:02:40.000> from

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
but according to these new rumors from

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.360 
but according to these new rumors from
that<00:02:40.630> other<00:02:40.780> gsmarena<00:02:41.680> they're<00:02:41.980> talking

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
that other gsmarena they're talking

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.430 
that other gsmarena they're talking
about<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.000> year<00:02:43.270> but<00:02:43.660> matagi<00:02:43.990> hurts

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
about this year but matagi hurts

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.360 
about this year but matagi hurts
something<00:02:45.160> external<00:02:45.580> cpu<00:02:46.060> dual<00:02:47.050> core<00:02:47.440> GPU<00:02:48.070> as

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
something external cpu dual core GPU as

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.550 
something external cpu dual core GPU as
well<00:02:48.670> i'm<00:02:49.090> sure<00:02:49.150> i<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:49.900> think<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> gas<00:02:50.350> is

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
well i'm sure i don't think the gas is

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.480 
well i'm sure i don't think the gas is
to<00:02:50.710> have<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.920> dual<00:02:51.100> core<00:02:51.310> GPU<00:02:51.960> but<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> next<00:02:54.460> day

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
to have a dual core GPU but the next day

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.880 
to have a dual core GPU but the next day
or<00:02:54.850> life<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.330> 4s<00:02:55.600> right<00:02:55.810> now<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.170> I've<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.650> have

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
or life in 4s right now and I've to have

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.760 
or life in 4s right now and I've to have
the<00:02:57.070> dual<00:02:57.490> core<00:02:57.820> GPU<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.600> then<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.500> had<00:02:59.650> at

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
the dual core GPU and then we had at

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.250 
the dual core GPU and then we had at
eight<00:03:00.000> megapixel<00:03:01.000> camera<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.390> Gator<00:03:01.840> marina

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
eight megapixel camera on Gator marina

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.500 
eight megapixel camera on Gator marina
and<00:03:02.590> also<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.250> battery<00:03:03.670> very<00:03:04.090> very

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and also the battery very very

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.090 
and also the battery very very
interesting<00:03:05.640> 2050<00:03:06.640> milliamps<00:03:07.830> very<00:03:08.830> very

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
interesting 2050 milliamps very very

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.820 
interesting 2050 milliamps very very
exciting<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.150> hopefully<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:11.110> gsmarena

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
exciting so hopefully the gsmarena

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.320 
exciting so hopefully the gsmarena
rumors<00:03:12.280> or<00:03:12.550> true<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:13.990> we<00:03:14.200> don't<00:03:14.380> know<00:03:14.500> yet<00:03:14.740> but
