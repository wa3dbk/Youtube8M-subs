this is easier number one is a piece of
hair<00:01:06.810> nearest<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> back<00:01:07.530> number<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
hair nearest the back number two is the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
hair nearest the back number two is the
middle<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> number<00:01:09.720> three<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.290> key<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
middle and number three is the key to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.660

so from number three take a bit of hair
blend<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> cross<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:17.880> number<00:01:18.330> two

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
blend it in and cross it over number two

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
blend it in and cross it over number two
with<00:01:19.860> number<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.869> take<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> piece<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> hair

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

and<00:01:25.740> cross<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:26.900> number<00:01:27.900> two<00:01:28.610> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and cross it over number two so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.010 
and cross it over number two so
obviously<00:01:29.970> number<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> change

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
obviously number two is going to change

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.570 
obviously number two is going to change
but<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.410> just<00:01:31.560> basically<00:01:31.860> always<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> big
