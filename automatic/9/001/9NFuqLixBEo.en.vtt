00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the grill is because there's surface

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.720 
this fender here but the chrome still on
there<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.740> been<00:01:28.830> hard<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.580> the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
there would have been hard to do the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.270 
there would have been hard to do the
sandblasting<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.540> needs<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.870> be<00:01:31.020> done<00:01:31.280> and
