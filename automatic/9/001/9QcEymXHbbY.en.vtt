hi my name's and so if you've seen the
video<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:20.010> yogurt<00:00:20.279> you'll<00:00:20.640> see

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
video on how to make yogurt you'll see

video on how to make yogurt you'll see
the<00:00:21.840> issue<00:00:22.019> is<00:00:22.350> keeping<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> yogurt<00:00:23.430> at

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the issue is keeping the yogurt at

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.179 
the issue is keeping the yogurt at
exactly<00:00:23.910> 108<00:00:24.510> degrees<00:00:24.980> Fahrenheit<00:00:25.980> during

exactly 108 degrees Fahrenheit during

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
exactly 108 degrees Fahrenheit during
the<00:00:26.699> incubation<00:00:26.849> period<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> tricky

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the incubation period it's a tricky

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.589 
the incubation period it's a tricky
thing<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.090> unless<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.300> absolutely

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
thing to do and unless it's absolutely

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.200 
thing to do and unless it's absolutely
perfect<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.320> bacteria<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.160> multiplied<00:00:32.730> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
perfect the bacteria are multiplied as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
perfect the bacteria are multiplied as
well<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.350> might<00:00:34.560> do<00:00:34.740> there's<00:00:35.460> also<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
well as they might do there's also the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
well as they might do there's also the
possibility<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.840> burning<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> milk<00:00:37.880> when<00:00:38.880> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
possibility of burning the milk when you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.740 
possibility of burning the milk when you
first<00:00:39.180> raise<00:00:39.630> it<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> temperature<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.750> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
first raise it up to temperature so on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
first raise it up to temperature so on
the<00:00:42.840> market<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.290> were<00:00:43.350> loads<00:00:43.560> and<00:00:43.860> loads<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the market there were loads and loads of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
the market there were loads and loads of
yogurt<00:00:44.340> makers<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.600> pretty

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
yogurt makers you can get now all pretty

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
yogurt makers you can get now all pretty
similar<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.650> they're<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.950> pretty<00:00:47.490> much<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
similar and they're all pretty much the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.230 
similar and they're all pretty much the
same<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.730> 180<00:00:50.730> pounds<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
same I think you get 180 pounds at a

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240 
same I think you get 180 pounds at a
time<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.720> see<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:51.960> 225<00:00:52.380> pounds<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.040> do<00:00:53.220> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
time you see or 225 pounds you go do it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
time you see or 225 pounds you go do it
yourself<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.880> push<00:00:54.780> comes<00:00:54.990> to<00:00:55.080> shove<00:00:55.320> what

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
yourself but push comes to shove what

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
yourself but push comes to shove what
they<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.830> do<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:57.030> maintain<00:00:57.720> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
they all do is they maintain a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
they all do is they maintain a
temperature<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.380> certain<00:00:58.650> period<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.950> time

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
temperature for a certain period of time

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
temperature for a certain period of time
so<00:00:59.970> rather<00:01:00.690> than<00:01:00.840> sitting<00:01:01.080> now<00:01:01.290> in<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.530> heart

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so rather than sitting now in your heart

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
so rather than sitting now in your heart
whisking<00:01:02.220> your<00:01:02.370> milk<00:01:02.580> with<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.970> one<00:01:03.150> with<00:01:03.270> all

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
whisking your milk with it one with all

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
whisking your milk with it one with all
that<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> stuff<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.800> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that kind of stuff all you do is you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
that kind of stuff all you do is you
choose<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.610> job<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.360> yogurt<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
choose the job that you want yogurt to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
choose the job that you want yogurt to
be<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.800> people<00:01:07.920> use<00:01:08.250> theirs

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
be and I like a lot of people use theirs

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.190 
be and I like a lot of people use theirs
nice<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.510> major

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
nice little major

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.450 
nice little major
I<00:01:11.229> think<00:01:11.380> we<00:01:11.469> haven't<00:01:11.740> seen<00:01:11.920> her<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.189> come<00:01:12.430> with

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
I think we haven't seen her to come with

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.300 
I think we haven't seen her to come with
her<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.930> her<00:01:13.960> jars<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.649> all<00:01:14.950> you'll<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.219> is

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
her with her jars and all you'll do is

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.700 
her with her jars and all you'll do is
you'll<00:01:15.430> put<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:15.729> milk<00:01:15.909> into<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.560> they'll

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
you'll put your milk into it so they'll

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.469 
you'll put your milk into it so they'll
fiddle<00:01:17.979> little<00:01:18.189> pots<00:01:18.430> up<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.880> you'll<00:01:19.299> turn

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
fiddle little pots up and you'll turn

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.209 
fiddle little pots up and you'll turn
the<00:01:19.539> auger<00:01:19.810> machine<00:01:20.049> on<00:01:20.289> well<00:01:20.860> that'll<00:01:21.130> do

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
the auger machine on well that'll do

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.149 
the auger machine on well that'll do
that'll<00:01:21.520> heat<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:21.939> up<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.210> 100<00:01:22.799> 185<00:01:23.799> degrees

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
that'll heat it up to 100 185 degrees

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.010 
that'll heat it up to 100 185 degrees
around<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.549> was<00:01:24.700> floating<00:01:24.850> about<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.149> be<00:01:25.299> that

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
around I was floating about to be that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.600 
around I was floating about to be that
will<00:01:26.110> then<00:01:26.229> cool<00:01:26.560> down<00:01:26.590> it'll<00:01:27.159> cool<00:01:27.280> itself

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
will then cool down it'll cool itself

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.330 
will then cool down it'll cool itself
down<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:28.380> 120<00:01:29.380> degrees<00:01:29.710> before<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.069> needs<00:01:30.189> to

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
down to 120 degrees before it needs to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.190 
down to 120 degrees before it needs to
be<00:01:30.460> it'll<00:01:31.119> then<00:01:31.210> leave<00:01:31.539> with<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.810> or<00:01:31.929> whatever

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
be it'll then leave with you or whatever

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.679 
be it'll then leave with you or whatever
and<00:01:32.500> then<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:32.710> have<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.460> start<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:36.270> video<00:01:37.270> and

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
and then you have to start the video and

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.830 
and then you have to start the video and
and<00:01:38.319> then<00:01:38.740> it'll<00:01:38.950> keep<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.490> at<00:01:39.909> 180<00:01:40.569> degrees

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
and then it'll keep it at 180 degrees

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.749 
and then it'll keep it at 180 degrees
for<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.829> period<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.130> time<00:01:42.219> that<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.460> want<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
for the period of time that you want it

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.399 
for the period of time that you want it
to<00:01:42.850> be<00:01:42.969> and<00:01:43.240> it'll<00:01:43.390> never<00:01:43.569> vary<00:01:43.869> it'll<00:01:44.170> provide

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
to be and it'll never vary it'll provide

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.230 
to be and it'll never vary it'll provide
the<00:01:44.560> absolute<00:01:44.679> optimum<00:01:45.549> temperature<00:01:46.000> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the absolute optimum temperature and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.929 
the absolute optimum temperature and
perfect<00:01:46.630> environment<00:01:46.899> for<00:01:47.619> bacteria<00:01:47.830> in<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
perfect environment for bacteria in the

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.730 
perfect environment for bacteria in the
milk<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.360> multiply<00:01:49.840> thus<00:01:50.200> turning<00:01:50.470> into

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
milk to multiply thus turning into

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.359 
milk to multiply thus turning into
yogurt<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.329> think<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:53.369> just

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
yogurt and I think that is just

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.329 
yogurt and I think that is just
simplifies<00:01:55.119> things
