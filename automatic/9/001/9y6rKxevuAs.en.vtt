a<00:02:23.120> problem<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:24.010> picture<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.400> image<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
a problem I picture the image of the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.480 
a problem I picture the image of the
thinker<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.770> something<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.340> first

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
thinker and it's something that first

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.040 
thinker and it's something that first
came<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> me<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> guess<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.600> was<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.870> art

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
came to me I guess when I was in art

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.010 
came to me I guess when I was in art
school<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> 80s<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.210> it's<00:02:32.210> an<00:02:32.390> image<00:02:32.750> that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
school in the 80s and it's an image that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.290 
school in the 80s and it's an image that
has<00:02:33.170> stayed<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:33.500> me<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:34.490> now<00:02:34.820> here<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> am<00:02:35.090> in

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
has stayed with me and now here I am in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.760 
has stayed with me and now here I am in
July<00:02:35.480> walking<00:02:35.870> through<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.080> junk<00:02:36.320> shop<00:02:36.380> in

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
July walking through a junk shop in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.500 
July walking through a junk shop in
Alabama<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.430> there's<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.820> little<00:02:38.120> sculpture

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
Alabama and there's a little sculpture

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.940 
Alabama and there's a little sculpture
of<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> thinker<00:02:39.110> but<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.500> amazing<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
of the thinker but it's amazing that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.440 
of the thinker but it's amazing that
this<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.130> here<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.610> pile<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.060> junk<00:02:41.300> that's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
this is here on the pile of junk that's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.330 
this is here on the pile of junk that's
this<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.860> took<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
this so I took it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.830 
this so I took it
the<00:02:43.520> woman<00:02:43.760> said<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:43.970> was<00:02:44.060> only<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.270> dollar<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the woman said it was only a dollar and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170 
the woman said it was only a dollar and
so<00:02:45.020> an<00:02:45.830> image<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.340> always<00:02:46.550> had<00:02:46.880> when<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
so an image that I always had when I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.490 
so an image that I always had when I
thought<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.690> think<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:47.990> was<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> lightbulb

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
thought it to think it was a lightbulb

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.990 
thought it to think it was a lightbulb
over<00:02:48.590> his<00:02:48.860> head<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.460> that's<00:02:49.670> why<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.820> made

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
over his head and so that's why I made

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.850 
over his head and so that's why I made
that<00:02:50.030> lamp<00:02:50.390> sort<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.140> sight<00:02:51.380> gag

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
that lamp sort of a sight gag

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.380 
that lamp sort of a sight gag
and<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.550> just<00:02:52.700> wanted<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> show<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> few

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and I just wanted to show a few

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.730 
and I just wanted to show a few
techniques<00:02:53.690> about<00:02:53.870> making<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.290> rubber<00:02:54.500> mold

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
techniques about making a rubber mold

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.420 
techniques about making a rubber mold
and<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.200> case<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> very<00:02:57.620> complicated<00:02:57.980> mold

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
and in that case a very complicated mold

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.190 
and in that case a very complicated mold
because<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.910> all<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> undercuts<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.750> his<00:02:59.840> arms

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
because of all the undercuts of his arms

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.500 
because of all the undercuts of his arms
and<00:03:00.380> such<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.580> was<00:03:01.850> able<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.120> pull<00:03:02.330> him<00:03:02.420> out

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and such but I was able to pull him out

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:18.550 
and such but I was able to pull him out
of<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> mold<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.580> few<00:03:04.880> lamps<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:17.560> lot

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
of the mold and make a few lamps a lot

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.930 
of the mold and make a few lamps a lot
of<00:03:18.650> times<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.950> added<00:03:19.220> myself<00:03:19.370> when<00:03:19.820> I'm

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
of times I added myself when I'm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.910 
of times I added myself when I'm
thinking<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.480> what<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> video<00:03:21.110> could<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.740> I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
thinking of what a video could be and I

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800 
thinking of what a video could be and I
think<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.190> myself<00:03:22.280> that's<00:03:23.000> too<00:03:23.270> simple<00:03:23.630> or

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
think to myself that's too simple or

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.240 
think to myself that's too simple or
it's<00:03:23.990> repetitive<00:03:24.350> or<00:03:24.710> it's<00:03:24.860> something<00:03:25.040> I've

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's repetitive or it's something I've

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.030 
it's repetitive or it's something I've
done<00:03:25.280> before<00:03:25.720> but<00:03:26.720> by<00:03:27.410> making<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.890> moose

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
done before but by making a moose

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.380 
done before but by making a moose
antlers<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.550> showing<00:03:28.880> all<00:03:28.970> these<00:03:29.090> different

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
antlers and showing all these different

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.910 
antlers and showing all these different
techniques<00:03:29.660> which<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.960> didn't<00:03:30.200> think<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.590> until

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
techniques which I didn't think of until

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.060 
techniques which I didn't think of until
I<00:03:30.980> got<00:03:31.130> into<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:32.180> just<00:03:33.080> goes<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.500> show<00:03:33.530> me<00:03:33.890> as

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
I got into it it just goes to show me as

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.540 
I got into it it just goes to show me as
an<00:03:34.220> example<00:03:35.200> even<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.290> simplest<00:03:36.680> thing<00:03:37.010> could

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
an example even the simplest thing could

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.730 
an example even the simplest thing could
actually<00:03:37.580> be<00:03:37.910> interesting<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.560> moose

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
actually be interesting and the moose

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.080 
actually be interesting and the moose
antlers<00:03:40.130> themselves<00:03:40.580> are<00:03:40.700> something<00:03:40.970> I've

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
antlers themselves are something I've

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.420 
antlers themselves are something I've
had<00:03:41.210> sitting<00:03:41.510> around<00:03:41.600> for<00:03:41.780> 10<00:03:41.990> years<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.500> I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
had sitting around for 10 years and I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.460 
had sitting around for 10 years and I
sort<00:03:44.300> of<00:03:44.360> reinvented<00:03:44.900> them<00:03:45.050> now<00:03:45.320> they're

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
sort of reinvented them now they're

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.230 
sort of reinvented them now they're
hanging<00:03:45.710> on<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:45.890> wall<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.400> I'm<00:03:46.730> excited<00:03:47.030> about

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
hanging on the wall so I'm excited about

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.820 
hanging on the wall so I'm excited about
that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.410

real simple slab of wood this level wood

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.030 
real simple slab of wood this level wood
was<00:03:59.540> only<00:03:59.720> 20<00:04:00.050> bucks<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.620> steel<00:04:00.860> was

was only 20 bucks and the steel was

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.250 
was only 20 bucks and the steel was
about<00:04:01.220> another<00:04:01.400> $20<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.780> can<00:04:02.930> make<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> nice

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
about another $20 you can make a nice

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.510 
about another $20 you can make a nice
piece<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.530> furniture<00:04:03.740> with<00:04:04.040> high<00:04:04.190> perceived
