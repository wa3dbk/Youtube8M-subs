even do anything what type of surgery
they<00:03:03.900> need<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.519> do<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:06.620> computer<00:03:08.180> morphing<00:03:09.180> and

they need and do a computer morphing and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.470 
they need and do a computer morphing and
that<00:03:10.920> means<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.120> actually

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
that means that we can I can actually

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.840 
that means that we can I can actually
figure<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.870> how<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:14.220> person<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.609> going<00:03:14.790> to

look<00:03:15.030> after<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.750> surgery<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.799> can<00:03:16.829> bounce

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
look after the surgery and I can bounce

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.430 
look after the surgery and I can bounce
between<00:03:17.810> looking<00:03:18.810> at<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> face<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:21.510> all

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
between looking at a face that is all

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
between looking at a face that is all
you<00:03:22.650> see<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.250> soft<00:03:23.730> tissue<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.090> an<00:03:24.420> actual

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
you see is the soft tissue or an actual

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.420 
you see is the soft tissue or an actual
looks<00:03:25.139> like<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.319> picture<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> person<00:03:25.950> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
looks like a picture of a person and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.520 
looks like a picture of a person and
with<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> couple<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.930> switches<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
with a couple of switches on the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.830 
with a couple of switches on the
computer<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> underlying<00:03:30.569> bone

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
computer I can see the underlying bone

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.930 
computer I can see the underlying bone
and<00:03:31.230> then<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.769> can<00:03:31.950> move<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.340> bones<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and then I can move the bones on the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.849 
and then I can move the bones on the
computer<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:34.049> see<00:03:34.290> what<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.590> does<00:03:34.650> to

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
computer and then see what that does to

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.610 
computer and then see what that does to
somebody's<00:03:35.400> face<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:37.139> has<00:03:37.380> been

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
somebody's face and that really has been

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.830 
somebody's face and that really has been
a<00:03:37.650> technological<00:03:38.370> breakthrough<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.540> treating

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
a technological breakthrough in treating

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.500 
a technological breakthrough in treating
people<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:40.950> reliable<00:03:41.459> they're<00:03:41.670> very

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
people it's pretty reliable they're very

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.449 
people it's pretty reliable they're very
reliable<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.769> know<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:43.950> really<00:03:44.190> get<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
reliable and you know you really get to

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.309 
reliable and you know you really get to

what we call sculpturing the patient's
face<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:47.370> only<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.819> correct<00:03:48.090> their<00:03:48.299> body

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
face not only can you correct their body

face not only can you correct their body
but<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.989> can<00:03:50.060> take<00:03:51.060> someone<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.599> would

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
but you can take someone that would

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.229 
but you can take someone that would
otherwise<00:03:52.049> have<00:03:52.650> sought<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:53.670> argument<00:03:54.090> sake

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
otherwise have sought for argument sake

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.970 
otherwise have sought for argument sake
or<00:03:54.510> lack<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.500> better<00:03:55.530> term<00:03:55.709> of

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
normal looking face so you can correct

normal looking face so you can correct
the<00:04:01.139> four<00:04:01.380> conditions<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.980> mentioned<00:04:02.400> before

either by putting some extension or you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.539 
either by putting some extension or you
reduce<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.169> size<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.829> jar<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.370> some
