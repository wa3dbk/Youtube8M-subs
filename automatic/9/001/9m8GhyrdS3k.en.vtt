00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hello Evgeny Matveev and this 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.340
 workshop pit stop congratulations to all 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 finally with the beginning of spring I have long wanted 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.630
 dedicate one very interesting question 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.880
 but somehow over time he missed it 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.550
 out of sight and here is one of the subscribers to me 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 reminded today just the same I about him 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.769
 and talk next question 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 to what extent can sharpen 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 standard 50 cylinder 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 two-stroke Japanese moped sake 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 experiment a long time ago I took and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 squandered up to 47 millimeters cylinder from 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 honda dio 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.680
 ryazan talkie in general experiment not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.870
 crowned with success since walls 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 sleeves turned out to be extremely thin and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 he just turned out to be full of holes 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 after boring 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 looking ahead answer the question of all who 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.250
 wondered whether you can squander 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840
 seventy two dice standard 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 cylinder 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.359
 I say that there is no waste it will not succeed 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.850
 since the liner is very thin and so 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.010
 the degree of boring does not provide for eating 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.229
 another couple of interesting nuances that I 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 I want to voice this on the left of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.560
 you the same piston honda dio zx 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.150
 or the so-called af34 e bore and to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 47 millimeters in my even up to 48 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.490
 Now we will know for sure because I already 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490
 I do not remember 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.800
 forty seven and a half first 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.350
 very thin cylinder walls remain 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.340
 even if you were not here holes 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 through which I tried in vain 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.280
 Brew semi-automatic knowledge base in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.560
 I was completely back 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.240
 scarce and thought that this number will take place in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.370
 Generally all here is polished but 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.650
 Of course, such a system does not work anymore. 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.020
 will therefore I did not even try her 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.490
 put on the motor and test here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 standard cylinder from yamaha 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 it is also possible in principle to make sure that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.710
 the sleeve is unlikely 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.899
 thicker than honda dio on the outside 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.459
 the side she is 51 millimeter here also 50 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.240
 and a half whether it is a big difference 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.740
 there is no and here in these places here you 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.540
 You can see here the traces of welding 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.810
 it is in these places that the cylinder was worn out 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.870
 and became full of holes after boring there is still 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.180
 one moment about growing up to forty 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 four millimeters is approximately 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.110
 sixty five dice sixty three 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.590
 sixty six depending on the course 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.330
 piston what I want to say about this 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.730
 here schematically a little, I drew 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.890
 cylinder in general in longitudinal section 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.790
 running a little ahead I will explain that here 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.209
 this is our exhaust window that is here 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.680
 dey hatch this place in a cylinder cut-off 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.170
 general, what else can I say about 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.709
 sprouts up to sixty five cubes 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.810
 approximately in general with such 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.519
 sprouts need to consider the fact that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.480
 purge windows do not abut the cylinder 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.870
 at right angles 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.549
 and here they have a certain angle that is 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.390
 not 90 degrees and then when you 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.739
 pump the liner 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.470
 to a larger diameter then of course if 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.980
 pay attention then the edge of the purge 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.140
 window 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.660
 changes its height as upper edge 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.180
 same bottom edge is another thing that when 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.650
 such growth some flaws 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.409
 which arise 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.489
 for variable valve timing with 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.709
 pays off by increasing the volume and 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.540
 almost a big difference here and you 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.209
 don't see and feel even some 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.189
 increment but again whichever 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.980
 how are the purge windows 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.930
 cylinder can be felt differently 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.540
 power gain with increasing volume 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.060
 cylinder is such an important moment 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.030
 of course when you sharpen up to 47 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.599
 millimeters then the sleeve becomes thinner 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.780
 more 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.609
 and the windows are lowered so much that the whole 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.299
 your potential which you want 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.940
 realize fades due to the fact that 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:21.419
 the window is completely different 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.650
 place unlike the original and purge 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.780
 varies greatly that is 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.210
 side and purge windows 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.830
 the frontal is very much inside the cylinder 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.289
 down relative to the pistons 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.690
 it turns out that the piston is coming to the bottom 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.889
 dead center no yes opens these windows 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.060
 and all your time. 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.400
 It turns out for nothing because 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.250
 blowdown is very much worse 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.639
 side and thus lost power 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.360
 when we are dealing with ready 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:54.510
 particular cylinder this scooters sym 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.970
 racing seventy two dice factory 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.699
 another thing here is completely in that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.729
 is that initially geometry 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.409
 casting such a cylinder here is designed for 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.479
 the fact that the diameter here will be larger 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:12.750
 so here they make thicker walls 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.070
 as here on the purge and here and all 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.370
 it is calculated to some extent 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.490
 so the window on the cylinder which 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.860
 originally calculated under the pro. Yes 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.409
 47-48 millimeters of the window remain on those 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.260
 same places 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:31.680
 particular it is a piston 8 ports and here 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.630
 they can be counted 8 pieces once two three 4 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:40.550
 5 six 7 8 that is plus 2 ports on 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.659
 exhaust so compensated 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.800
 lack of exhaust if you make one 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.550
 big window then 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.340
 compression rings will mix 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.010
 Of course, such an operation is done on 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.230
 knee with a native cylinder almost 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.340
 impossible I tried it turned out 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.620
 once 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.690
 the second time this number has not passed this 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.850
 very difficult and time consuming 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.440
 justifies itself especially with 65 cubes 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.350
 For clarity, this cylinder and I 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.350
 Now I will cut in the right place and show 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.330
 more clearly what actually 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.790
 happens after such a sprout and 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.100
 how thin is the sleeve that 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.260
 also important for the worse 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.180
 side on the characteristics of the motors than 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.070
 thinner Elsa the greater the bias 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.020
 temperature worse cooling 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.910
 please your attention 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.500
 visual evidence that the channels 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.860
 in particular at least on the honda scam 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.620
 the cylinder is angled and when you 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.980
 his sleeve inevitably sharpen the window 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.080
 goes down the same thing happens and 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.030
 with side blowing windows here 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.590
 Of course the angle is not so sharp but it is 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.680
 and please here you can already make sure 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.090
 in that sleeve 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.190
 thinning to almost zero here 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.650
 it is of course not yet clearly seen 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.230
 here in this place can be seen just 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:05.120
 it is excellent that there is no case left 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:06.730
 nothing at all here here here 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.940
 please you another angle 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:13.820
 that is, this is what we have is the front 5 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.180
 the window turns out the so -called and two 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.180
 lateral 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.700
 also exactly all this here you can see that under 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.900
 angle and when the sleeve becomes thin then this 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.130
 the window just as well goes down and 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:31.150
 the most down 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:34.500
 back window because here the angle is bigger 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.500
 even than 45 degrees 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.259
 with you she was not matveev it was 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.240
 workshop pit stop subscribe 

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:51.069
 rate don't keep secret from 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.069
 Friends to all for now and thank you for your trust.
