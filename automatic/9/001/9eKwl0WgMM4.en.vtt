00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.789 

well<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.460> bet<00:00:02.730> another<00:00:02.850> oil<00:00:03.210> filter

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
well I bet another oil filter

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.420 
well I bet another oil filter
unfortunately<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:04.920> another<00:00:04.980> frame

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
unfortunately it's another frame

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.419 
unfortunately it's another frame
although<00:00:05.759> by<00:00:06.029> taking<00:00:06.420> one<00:00:06.540> apart<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.529> this

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
although by taking one apart for this

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.879 
although by taking one apart for this
one<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.790> an<00:00:08.910> older<00:00:09.179> one<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.710> here

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
one was an older one and this one here

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.850 
one was an older one and this one here
is<00:00:10.920> from<00:00:11.250> 2012<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.410> it'll<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> little<00:00:13.740> more

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
is from 2012 so it'll be a little more

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.540 
is from 2012 so it'll be a little more
accurate<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.940> today's<00:00:15.150> standards<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> once<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
accurate to today's standards so once I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
accurate to today's standards so once I
think<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:17.940> apart<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.420> also<00:00:18.570> compare

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
think this one apart I can also compare

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.920 
think this one apart I can also compare
up<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> older<00:00:19.949> frame<00:00:20.220> directly<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> when

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
up to the older frame directly so when

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.970 
up to the older frame directly so when
I'm<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:22.170> I'll<00:00:22.320> land<00:00:22.500> next<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> each<00:00:22.890> other

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I'm done I'll land next to each other

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
I'm done I'll land next to each other
and<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.699> anything<00:00:23.970> changed<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
and see if anything changed over a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.470 
and see if anything changed over a
decade<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.820> all<00:00:26.820> right<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.119> I'll<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.330> right

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
decade or so all right so I'll get right

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.890 
decade or so all right so I'll get right

there<00:02:05.610> there's<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.030> lot<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.480> pleats<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.020> we're

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
there there's a lot of pleats if we're

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.080 
there there's a lot of pleats if we're
on<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> side<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> other<00:02:08.910> side

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
on this side here but on the other side

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.870 
on this side here but on the other side
they're<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.630> very<00:02:09.810> spaced<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.880> typical

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
they're very very spaced out typical

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.570 
they're very very spaced out typical
frame<00:02:12.290> these<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.620> they<00:02:13.770> don't<00:02:13.920> press<00:02:14.280> me<00:02:14.460> at

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
frame these up they don't press me at

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.449 
frame these up they don't press me at
all<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:16.220> don't<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.430> the

all I don't like that and on to the

all I don't like that and on to the
inside<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> filter<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.770> hope<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:25.920> about

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
inside of the filter I hope them about

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.030 
inside of the filter I hope them about
the<00:02:26.190> rest<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.610> oil<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:28.040> it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the rest of the oil that's in here it's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.750 
the rest of the oil that's in here it's
a<00:02:29.130> little<00:02:29.280> leaf<00:02:29.490> spring<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:33.260> inside<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
a little leaf spring and inside of the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.460 
a little leaf spring and inside of the
actual<00:02:38.000> canister<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.239> see<00:02:40.230> there's<00:02:40.410> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
actual canister you can see there's a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.729 
actual canister you can see there's a
little<00:02:40.860> tiny<00:02:41.010> particles<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:42.080> slotin<00:02:43.080> things

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
little tiny particles of slotin things

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.090 
little tiny particles of slotin things
in<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> whole<00:02:44.910> lot<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:47.070> little

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
in there not a whole lot just a little

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.310 
in there not a whole lot just a little
particle<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.910> there<00:02:48.000> alright<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.020> what

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
particle here and there alright so what

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.510 
particle here and there alright so what
I'm<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.770> I'm<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.190> clean<00:02:50.400> up

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
I'm going to do is I'm going to clean up

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.210 
I'm going to do is I'm going to clean up
all<00:02:51.030> these<00:02:51.270> parts<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:52.890> I'll<00:02:52.980> lay<00:02:53.100> them

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
all these parts and then I'll lay them

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
all these parts and then I'll lay them
out<00:02:53.310> next<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> older<00:02:54.300> frame<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:55.230> compare

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
out next to the older frame to compare

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.610 
out next to the older frame to compare
how<00:02:55.770> it's<00:02:55.950> changed<00:02:56.400> over<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.670> decade<00:02:56.970> or<00:02:57.000> so

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
how it's changed over a decade or so

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.660 
how it's changed over a decade or so
also<00:02:58.620> one<00:02:58.739> thing<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.950> forgot<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.250> mention<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
also one thing I forgot to mention it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.460 
also one thing I forgot to mention it
right<00:02:59.790> off<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.970> bat<00:03:00.150> was<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.140> filter

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
right off the bat was that this filter

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.180 
right off the bat was that this filter
does<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.720> bypass<00:03:03.720> valve<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
does not have a bypass valve like the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.610 
does not have a bypass valve like the
older<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.489> does<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.930> could<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.470> it's

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
older one does it could be because it's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.640 
older one does it could be because it's
related<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> car<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.230> was<00:03:10.320> put<00:03:10.470> on

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
related to the car then it was put on

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.710 
related to the car then it was put on
maybe<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.730> had<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> power<00:03:12.780> built<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.380> I

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
maybe it had one on the power built in I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020 
maybe it had one on the power built in I
don't<00:03:15.720> know<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.230> sure<00:03:16.260> right<00:03:16.500> now

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
don't know that for sure right now

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.930 
don't know that for sure right now
alright<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.510> parts<00:03:18.780> laid<00:03:18.959> out

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
alright so here all the parts laid out

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.170 
alright so here all the parts laid out
starting<00:03:20.940> off<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.330> canister<00:03:23.030> later<00:03:24.030> on

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
starting off with the canister later on

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.539 
starting off with the canister later on
they<00:03:24.299> added<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:25.100> texture<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.489> make

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
they added this texture in here to make

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.190 
they added this texture in here to make
it<00:03:26.610> more<00:03:26.730> creepy<00:03:27.150> than<00:03:27.180> you're<00:03:27.360> trying<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.570> put

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it more creepy than you're trying to put

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.750 
it more creepy than you're trying to put
it<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.380> or<00:03:28.590> off<00:03:30.140> going<00:03:31.140> by<00:03:31.290> thicknesses<00:03:31.799> just

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
it on or off going by thicknesses just

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.190 
it on or off going by thicknesses just
probably<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.269> same<00:03:33.450> take<00:03:33.959> about<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
probably about the same take about the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably about the same take about the
same<00:03:34.260> amount<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.620> force<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> squeeze<00:03:35.820> them<00:03:39.170> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
same amount of force to squeeze them and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.720 
same amount of force to squeeze them and
a<00:03:40.410> little<00:03:40.709> leaf<00:03:40.830> spring<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.280> keeps<00:03:41.610> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
a little leaf spring that keeps it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.530 
a little leaf spring that keeps it
together<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:43.410> see<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:44.239> one<00:03:45.239> from<00:03:45.420> today

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
together you see this one from today

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.940 
together you see this one from today
does<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.860> bypass<00:03:47.760> valve<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.450> a

see<00:04:17.979> that<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.370> Fram<00:04:18.910> from<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> decade<00:04:19.630> ago<00:04:19.750> has

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
see that the Fram from a decade ago has

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.460 
see that the Fram from a decade ago has
more<00:04:21.100> evenly<00:04:21.639> spread<00:04:21.940> plates<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:23.169> one<00:04:23.289> from

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
more evenly spread plates the one from

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.270 
more evenly spread plates the one from
today<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.710> doesn't<00:04:29.919> look<00:04:29.979> quite<00:04:30.130> as

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
today this one doesn't look quite as

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.249 
today this one doesn't look quite as
good<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.090> insides<00:04:34.539> you<00:04:34.870> can<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.110> that

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
good the insides you can see that

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.070 
good the insides you can see that
they've<00:04:35.380> added<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.710> swirl<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
they've added the swirl to it it's a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.080 
they've added the swirl to it it's a
little<00:04:38.289> swirl<00:04:38.560> Pyrenean<00:04:39.099> inside<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:39.910> one

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
little swirl Pyrenean inside of that one

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.570 
little swirl Pyrenean inside of that one
that<00:04:40.210> was<00:04:40.360> later<00:04:40.599> on<00:04:40.690> most<00:04:41.050> have<00:04:41.169> added<00:04:41.380> that

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
that was later on most have added that

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.589 
that was later on most have added that
because<00:04:42.580> there's<00:04:42.789> all<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.000> ones<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.300> not<00:04:43.449> have

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
because there's all the ones to not have

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:50.900 
because there's all the ones to not have
that<00:04:44.370> then<00:04:45.370> on<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.849> integrand<00:04:46.660> back<00:04:46.870> valve

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.850 

this<00:04:51.910> one<00:04:52.090> does<00:04:52.270> appear<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:52.570> be<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.650> rubber

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
this one does appear to be like a rubber

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.980 
this one does appear to be like a rubber
just<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:54.789> older<00:04:55.030> ones<00:04:55.180> although<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:55.960> a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
just like the older ones although it's a

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.850 
just like the older ones although it's a
different<00:04:56.259> style<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:58.259> do<00:04:59.259> see<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> little<00:04:59.620> bit<00:04:59.800> of

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
different style I do see a little bit of

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.499 
different style I do see a little bit of
sludge<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.340> wiped<00:05:00.940> most<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.419> off

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
sludge and it wiped most of it off

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.210 
sludge and it wiped most of it off
there's<00:05:02.199> a<00:05:02.410> little<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:02.710> left<00:05:02.860> those<00:05:03.039> go<00:05:03.160> to

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
there's a little bit left those go to

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.010 
there's a little bit left those go to
sludge<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.699> the<00:05:03.849> rim<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:04.539> that's<00:05:04.840> what

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
sludge on the rim and that's what

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.870 
sludge on the rim and that's what
usually<00:05:05.139> causes<00:05:05.440> these<00:05:05.889> Fram<00:05:06.370> filters

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
usually causes these Fram filters

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.870 
usually causes these Fram filters
they're<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.900> little<00:05:08.560> anti<00:05:09.130> dramatic<00:05:09.550> valve<00:05:09.669> to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
they're a little anti dramatic valve to

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.790 
they're a little anti dramatic valve to
fail<00:05:10.090> it's<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.780> little<00:05:10.990> bit<00:05:11.110> sludge<00:05:11.349> and<00:05:11.590> after

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
fail it's a little bit sludge and after

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.469 
fail it's a little bit sludge and after
I<00:05:12.039> know<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:12.729> have<00:05:12.849> sitting<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.210> usually<00:05:13.449> just

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
I know you have sitting it usually just

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.249 
I know you have sitting it usually just
drains<00:05:13.810> back<00:05:14.050> anyway<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:15.930> then<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.169> the

drains back anyway and then on to the
cap<00:05:18.479> about<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.599> same<00:05:19.780> weight<00:05:21.599> how<00:05:22.599> about<00:05:22.780> the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
cap about the same weight how about the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.990 
cap about the same weight how about the
same<00:05:22.990> size<00:05:24.240> similar<00:05:25.240> filters<00:05:26.460> on<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.699> o-ring

same size similar filters on the o-ring
as<00:05:28.150> well<00:05:30.360> took<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.449> off<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.599> this<00:05:31.780> one<00:05:32.039> being<00:05:33.039> on

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
as well took it off of this one being on

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.499 
as well took it off of this one being on
the<00:05:33.400> newer<00:05:33.759> frames<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.210> bit<00:05:34.360> larger<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:37.240> older

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
the newer frames a bit larger the older

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.890 
the newer frames a bit larger the older
one<00:05:37.630> kind<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.870> fits<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:39.449> but<00:05:40.449> overall<00:05:40.509> it's

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
one kind of fits in it but overall it's

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.070 
one kind of fits in it but overall it's
just<00:05:41.080> an<00:05:41.199> o-ring<00:05:41.289> it's<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:42.669> know<00:05:42.930> it's<00:05:43.930> thick

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
just an o-ring it's you know it's thick

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.159 
just an o-ring it's you know it's thick
as<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.320> needs<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.650> really<00:05:46.050> all<00:05:47.050> right

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
as it needs to be really all right

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.089 
as it needs to be really all right
here's<00:05:47.349> one<00:05:47.470> more<00:05:47.590> thing<00:05:47.650> I<00:05:47.830> don't<00:05:47.919> like<00:05:48.009> about

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
here's one more thing I don't like about

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.170 
here's one more thing I don't like about
frame<00:05:48.490> along<00:05:48.820> with<00:05:49.030> their<00:05:49.150> valves<00:05:51.180> inside

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
frame along with their valves inside

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.390 
frame along with their valves inside
where<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.050> leaf<00:05:53.500> spring<00:05:53.740> goes<00:05:53.919> on<00:05:54.099> to<00:05:54.250> which

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
where the leaf spring goes on to which

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.459 
where the leaf spring goes on to which
is<00:05:54.550> some<00:05:54.759> normally<00:05:55.509> have<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.810> bypass<00:05:56.259> valve

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
is some normally have the bypass valve

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.890 
is some normally have the bypass valve
on<00:05:56.800> it<00:05:56.909> the<00:05:57.909> other<00:05:58.030> thing<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.240> seals<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.750> is

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
on it the other thing that seals it is

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.730 
on it the other thing that seals it is
the<00:05:59.139> actual<00:05:59.469> cardboard<00:05:59.979> on<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:01.349> actual<00:06:02.349> veil

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
the actual cardboard on the actual veil

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.950 
the actual cardboard on the actual veil
or<00:06:03.099> the<00:06:03.219> spring<00:06:03.400> itself<00:06:03.699> s<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:04.780> you're

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
or the spring itself s and you're

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.089 
or the spring itself s and you're
supposed<00:06:05.169> to<00:06:05.229> get<00:06:05.349> a<00:06:05.409> good<00:06:05.560> seal<00:06:05.800> on<00:06:05.919> between

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
supposed to get a good seal on between

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.010 
supposed to get a good seal on between
here<00:06:06.430> I<00:06:07.710> don't<00:06:08.710> know<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:09.539> mean<00:06:10.539> I<00:06:10.599> guess<00:06:10.780> it's

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
here I don't know I mean I guess it's

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.170 
here I don't know I mean I guess it's
even<00:06:11.380> but<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:12.400> really<00:06:12.580> get<00:06:12.669> that<00:06:12.820> great<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.120> a

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
even but you really get that great of a

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.689 
even but you really get that great of a
seal<00:06:13.360> between<00:06:13.509> a<00:06:14.009> cardboard<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.280> metal<00:06:15.430> I

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
seal between a cardboard and metal I

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:16.330 
seal between a cardboard and metal I
don't<00:06:16.030> know

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
don't know

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.210 
don't know
then<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.180> same<00:06:17.300> goes<00:06:17.540> on<00:06:17.660> the<00:06:17.720> top<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:18.290> little

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
then the same goes on the top a little

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.250 
then the same goes on the top a little
entering<00:06:19.490> back<00:06:19.850> valve<00:06:20.060> just<00:06:20.690> sits<00:06:20.870> on<00:06:20.930> top<00:06:21.110> of

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
entering back valve just sits on top of

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.310 
entering back valve just sits on top of
there<00:06:21.520> it's<00:06:22.520> expected<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.090> keep<00:06:23.240> 60<00:06:23.660> psi<00:06:24.080> back

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
there it's expected to keep 60 psi back

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.310 
there it's expected to keep 60 psi back
and<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:28.520> know<00:06:28.610> I<00:06:28.639> mean<00:06:29.150> it<00:06:29.240> fits<00:06:29.419> in<00:06:29.630> there<00:06:29.780> but

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
and you know I mean it fits in there but

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.290
