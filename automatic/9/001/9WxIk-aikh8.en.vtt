00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello in this immuno pill we are going to 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.799
 introduce us in the system of 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.020
 complement and let's go over in 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.230
 particular the activation pathways and in 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.480
 concrete the classical way the system of 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.820
 complement is made up of a collection of 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.740
 proteins with protease activity in 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.990
 residues of serine and that act in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.239
 cascade in the serum in a very 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.149
 similar to how do coagulation 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.649
 blood in this hydrolysis a 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.690
 certain protein like the one we have 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.109
 here in yellow acts on another the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.539
 green and proteomics in two fragments 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.640
 the large fragment or be is going to 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.199
 deposit on the surface of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.079
 pathogens while the fragment 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.510
 light or it will be free in the middle 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.519
 in a generic way the big fragments 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.280
 about lining the surface of the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.499
 pathogens are going to be called opsony nash 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.929
 and the coating process is called 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.630
 optimization while the fragments 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.090
 small and are released to the middle are called 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.280
 to phil or toxins and your function will be 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.920
 be chemotherapeutic agents on new 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.469
 inflammatory cells as we see in 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 some situation two fragments the green 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.729
 and yellow are combined in the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.189
 surface of the pathogen and they build a 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.960
 new enzyme these enzymes combined 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.770
 by several fragments they are called convert 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 handles 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.719
 so this new convertase will act on 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.819
 a fragment in this case the rose and what 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.890
 will split into two subunits again the 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.250
 large or beque is deposited in the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 pathogen and the small one or a toxin phylum 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.900
 that is released to the medium 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.030
 the complement system can be 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.700
 activate in three ways that are called 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.640
 Classically, the classic route is the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.409
 the lectins and the alternative route the way 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.750
 classic is a tool of the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.220
 adaptive immunity while the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.350
 two others are tools of the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.720
 innate immunity this is important 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 when we review the elements a bit 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.540
 no data and adaptive response 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.910
 immune 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.160
 today we are going to review in particular the way 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.530
 classic complement system 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.140
 the adaptive tool as you see the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.080
 three converge into an action that is the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.240
 activation of the c3 protein that goes to 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.100
 be the key or central point of the axis of 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.530
 complement activation 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.900
 finally they will produce attraction of other 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.310
 inflammatory cells to the area are 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.050
 will produce what we just saw 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.290
 optimization or coating of 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.600
 pathogens and at the final moment it 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.460
 will produce a pore in the membrane of the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 pathogen all this to drive your 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.990
 death let's see now in detail 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.680
 the classic way 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.340
 Four factors participate in this way 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.990
 c1 c2 c3 and c4 the factor c1 which is the one 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.170
 we have here in the bottom image 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.450
 left is a great protein a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.490
 multi protein complex as you see with 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.700
 many subunits we have the subunit 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.940
 structural which is the subunit c1 cv and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.580
 what are these filamentous proteins 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.590
 finished in a globular domain in the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.760
 that in the factor 1 there may be up 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 6 units of c 1 q and then we have two 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.740
 factors of 1s and c 1 r which are the ones 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.200
 has an enzymatic activity or they would be 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.450
 protease here we have a micrograph at 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.220
 electronic microscope where we see the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.980
 structure of this great protein or 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.560
 multi-protein complex of c-1 that as 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.730
 You see, it looks like an open umbrella 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.709
 rods of an open umbrella 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.530
 how the classic path of the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.049
 complement is going to start because this 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.379
 protein c1 or this factor c1 for their 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.030
 globular domains is going to join 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.459
 immunoglobulins to bound antibodies 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.129
 on the surface of the pathogen is worth 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.110
 any immunoglobulin are not 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.750
 fundamentally immunoglobulin 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.150
 that I already remember you is selling america and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.579
 as you see form this structure to mode 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.430
 of spider on the surface of the 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.989
 pathogen fixing strongly and also 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.410
 will be worth to start the add-on 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.049
 by the classical route immunoglobulin g 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.790
 as you see c1 in any case is the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.700
 protein that recognizes the antibody 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.019
 attached to the pathogen from this 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.540
 moment of the operation of the track 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.540
 classic we will see an animation 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.660
 this is the pathogen let's see the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.900
 antigens and on these antigens binds 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.510
 the immunoglobulin and gg in this example 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.300
 c 1 q recognizes this united and active egg 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.060
 ago 1 r lithic subunit I remember you 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.460
 which in turn active ago 1s also 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.440
 lithic subunit let's minimize it and 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.900
 until 1 sec ago to act 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.290
 sequentially on c 4 and on the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.660
 factor c 2 as you see the big protein 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.810
 or b is deposited on the surface of the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.210
 pathogen and the small is released is formed 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.930
 thus a new enzyme the convertase of c3 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.000
 that acts as its name suggests about c3 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.070
 releasing great spawning proteins 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.080
 and small proteins or that remain 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.150
 free in the middle while b 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.150
 bind to the pathogen and so 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.290
 casual finally in some case a 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.990
 time factor of c3 is going to join the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.330
 convertase protein and it's going to form this 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.400
 tri-molecular complex that is called the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.400
 convertase dc5 of the classic way 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.440
 therefore as consequences of the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.080
 activation of the complement by way 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.060
 classic that has been achieved in the first 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.690
 place a large factor coating 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.539
 big 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.310
 3b on the surface of the pathogen a 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.220
 massive release of small fragments 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.069
 or c3 to the medium therefore they are going to 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.539
 bring inflammatory cells and finally 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.300
 It has formed this tri complex 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.120
 molecular which is the convertase dc5 of the 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.130
 classic way if we review what we finish 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.500
 to see in this pill we have reviewed 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.930
 the general generalities of the system 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.360
 of complement and the nomenclature which 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.240
 are the three activation pathways and if they are 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.680
 innate and adaptive tools how 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.720
 the complement is activated via 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.490
 classic and what factors intervene in 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.950
 this way and what are the big 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.620
 consequences of activation 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.210
 If you want to know if you've learned what 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.460
 we have explained you should ask what 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.160
 next how many are the ways of 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.510
 activation and what are their names 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.110
 which of them are innate and which are 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.200
 adaptive I've made starts the way 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.180
 classic which is the c3 convertase of 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.460
 this way and what are the consequences 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.520
 end of complement activation 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.260
 in the classic way and you know not to 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.090
 the next pill without answering well 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.090
 these questions until soon
