could ever be with this this is my
grandfather's<00:03:35.620> diary

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.660 

I<00:03:44.810> don't<00:03:45.810> quite<00:03:46.110> know<00:03:46.170> what<00:03:46.709> happened<00:03:47.159> or<00:03:47.430> what

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
I don't quite know what happened or what

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.660 
I don't quite know what happened or what
went<00:03:48.000> wrong<00:03:48.329> was<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.439> a<00:03:49.470> mistake<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:50.069> create

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
went wrong was it a mistake to create

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.509 
went wrong was it a mistake to create
the<00:03:50.970> ultimate<00:03:51.569> life<00:03:51.840> form<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.500> thought<00:03:53.340> it

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
the ultimate life form I thought it

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.220 
the ultimate life form I thought it
would<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.790> something<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.450> would<00:03:54.750> benefit

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
would be something that would benefit

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.580 
would be something that would benefit
mankind<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.569> military<00:03:57.810> guards

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
mankind but then the military guards

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.309 
mankind but then the military guards
landed<00:03:59.159> on<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.519> colony<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.060> day<00:04:00.540> they<00:04:01.260> were

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
landed on the colony that day they were

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.920 
landed on the colony that day they were

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
sent to destroy the research project

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.199 
sent to destroy the research project

Maria I hope you are all safe the
cruiser<00:04:15.450> washes<00:04:15.810> down<00:04:16.019> probably<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.739> keep<00:04:17.039> an

attack<00:04:17.789> from<00:04:17.940> falling<00:04:18.359> into<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.570> wrong<00:04:18.690> hands

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.940 

under<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.760> premise

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.440 

I<00:04:29.470> found<00:04:30.470> Maria's<00:04:30.980> name<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.640> moose<00:04:31.910> who<00:04:32.150> died

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
I found Maria's name of a moose who died

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.320 
I found Maria's name of a moose who died
when<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.960> art<00:04:33.230> was<00:04:33.500> shut<00:04:33.770> down<00:04:34.120> she<00:04:35.120> meant

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
when the art was shut down she meant

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.180 
when the art was shut down she meant
everything<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:36.020> me<00:04:37.690> she<00:04:38.690> died<00:04:39.110> because<00:04:39.680> of<00:04:40.040> my

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
everything to me she died because of my

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.400 
everything to me she died because of my
research<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:41.120> lost<00:04:42.020> everything

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
research I lost everything

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.810 
research I lost everything
I<00:04:45.410> waited<00:04:46.040> see<00:04:48.520> what's<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.760> Avenger<00:04:50.590> somehow

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
I waited see what's to Avenger somehow

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:00.350 
I waited see what's to Avenger somehow
someway

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.190 

based<00:05:01.360> on<00:05:01.780> my<00:05:02.050> original<00:05:03.000> projections<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.330> was

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
based on my original projections I was

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.840 
based on my original projections I was
able<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.680> complete<00:05:06.220> my<00:05:06.250> project<00:05:07.050> shadow<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
able to complete my project shadow I

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:19.560 
able to complete my project shadow I
designed<00:05:09.850> its<00:05:10.300> mind<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:11.140> be<00:05:11.380> perfect<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:19.270> you

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
designed its mind to be perfect if you

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.640 
designed its mind to be perfect if you
wish<00:05:20.040> release<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.700> awaken<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.420> if<00:05:22.750> she<00:05:23.170> wants

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
wish release and awaken it if she wants

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.080 
wish release and awaken it if she wants
to<00:05:23.860> fill<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.430> world<00:05:24.760> with<00:05:25.050> destruction<00:05:27.090> so

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
to fill the world with destruction so

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.540 
to fill the world with destruction so
that's<00:05:28.630> why<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.050> released<00:05:29.680> shadow<00:05:30.130> from<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
that's why you released shadow from the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:44.310 
that's why you released shadow from the
base

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:56.410 

my<00:05:44.860> grandpa

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.550 

shifted<00:05:57.420> due<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.930> amount<00:05:58.170> of<00:05:58.290> energy

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
shifted due to the amount of energy

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.490 
shifted due to the amount of energy
given<00:05:59.130> off<00:05:59.220> by<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.550> Emeril's<00:06:00.150> we<00:06:00.870> have<00:06:01.140> to

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
given off by the Emeril's we have to

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.250 
given off by the Emeril's we have to
stop<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.130> energy

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.280 

is<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.650> way<00:06:10.010> to<00:06:10.070> stop<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.730> energy<00:06:11.270> we<00:06:11.780> have<00:06:12.050> to

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
is a way to stop the energy we have to

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.190 
is a way to stop the energy we have to
use<00:06:12.530> your<00:06:12.860> ever

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.240 

master<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.940> power<00:06:18.210> to<00:06:18.630> stop<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.320> chaos

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
master the power to stop the chaos

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.700 
master the power to stop the chaos
that's<00:06:21.490> right<00:06:21.790> if<00:06:22.060> I've<00:06:22.300> used<00:06:22.690> this<00:06:22.900> I<00:06:23.170> just

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
that's right if I've used this I just

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.890 
that's right if I've used this I just
might<00:06:23.920> be<00:06:24.100> able<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.430> stop<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.940> Chaos<00:06:25.270> Emerald

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
might be able to stop the Chaos Emerald

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.059 
might be able to stop the Chaos Emerald
the<00:06:26.800> reaction<00:06:27.340> of<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.550> castle's<00:06:28.360> is<00:06:28.540> moving

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.159 

still<00:06:34.069> maybe<00:06:34.280> some<00:06:34.699> time<00:06:34.970> left<00:06:35.210> if<00:06:35.569> we<00:06:35.930> pull

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
still maybe some time left if we pull

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.439 
still maybe some time left if we pull
together<00:06:36.350> we<00:06:37.190> might<00:06:37.400> be<00:06:37.550> able<00:06:37.699> to<00:06:37.819> get<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.330> the

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
together we might be able to get to the

00:06:38.449 --> 00:07:01.290 
together we might be able to get to the
shortcut<00:06:38.900> that<00:06:39.080> leads<00:06:39.380> to<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:39.770> color
