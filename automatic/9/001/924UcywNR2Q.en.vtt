00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
code in the game that they found you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
code in the game that they found you
know<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.850> happens<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.480> mean

know a lot of times this happens I mean

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
know a lot of times this happens I mean
their<00:00:45.960> games<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.829> massive<00:00:47.460> there's<00:00:47.670> tons<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
their games are massive there's tons and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
their games are massive there's tons and
tons<00:00:48.719> amount<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.350> data<00:00:49.530> stuff<00:00:50.129> gets<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.640> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
tons amount of data stuff gets put in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.810 
tons amount of data stuff gets put in
thrown<00:00:51.629> into<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> pile<00:00:52.410> tested<00:00:53.219> thrown<00:00:53.579> out

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
thrown into the pile tested thrown out

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740 
thrown into the pile tested thrown out
and<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> mix<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:57.180> always

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and you know in all that mix not always

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
and you know in all that mix not always
do<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.260> clean<00:00:58.680> everything<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.520> perfectly

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
do they clean everything up perfectly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
do they clean everything up perfectly
because<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.570> such<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.469> massive

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
because there's just such a massive

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
because there's just such a massive
amount<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.910> mean<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> thought<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.870> room<00:01:04.350> was

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
amount I mean you thought your room was

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
amount I mean you thought your room was
hard<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> clean<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> sometimes<00:01:06.180> miss

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
hard to clean up and you sometimes miss

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.200 
hard to clean up and you sometimes miss
a<00:01:06.510> few<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.760> giant

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
a few things just think of like a giant

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.170 
a few things just think of like a giant
warehouse<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> everything<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
warehouse of stuff and everything is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
warehouse of stuff and everything is
just<00:01:12.450> piled<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.080> top<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> each<00:01:13.500> other<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
just piled on top of each other and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
just piled on top of each other and
you're<00:01:14.670> trying<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> organize<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.689> before

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you're trying to organize that before

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
you're trying to organize that before
release<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.590> basically<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
release that's basically what it is so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.649 
release that's basically what it is so
stuff<00:01:18.350> gets<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.220> mist<00:01:20.729> very<00:01:21.180> commonly

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
stuff gets lot like mist very commonly

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
stuff gets lot like mist very commonly
so<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.200> people<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so when these people go in and kind of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
so when these people go in and kind of
hack<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> game<00:01:24.270> check<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> code<00:01:25.470> out

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
hack the game check some of the code out

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
hack the game check some of the code out
you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.340> whatever<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:27.210> their<00:01:27.360> little<00:01:27.509> hacker

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you know whatever do their little hacker

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
you know whatever do their little hacker
stuff<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.860> find<00:01:29.250> these<00:01:29.520> remnants<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.329> ideas

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
stuff they find these remnants of ideas

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
stuff they find these remnants of ideas
that<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.770> potentially<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.610> could

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that could have potentially be could

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
that could have potentially be could
potentially<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> game<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> first

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
potentially be in the game now the first

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
potentially be in the game now the first
one<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.369> crazy<00:01:35.729> teleport<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:37.049> that's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
one is this crazy teleport thing that's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.359 
one is this crazy teleport thing that's
like<00:01:38.810> absolutely<00:01:39.810> ridiculous<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.860> go

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
like absolutely ridiculous like go

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
like absolutely ridiculous like go
through<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.670> walls<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.600> stuff<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.170> crazy

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
through like walls and stuff it's crazy

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.039 
through like walls and stuff it's crazy
it<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> little<00:01:45.210> buggy<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:45.960> you'll

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it is a little buggy and I think you'll

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
it is a little buggy and I think you'll
like<00:01:46.140> die<00:01:46.280> sometimes<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> teleport<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like die sometimes after you teleport so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
like die sometimes after you teleport so
it's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.020> crazy<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> didn't

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it's a little crazy you know that didn't

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.499 
it's a little crazy you know that didn't
get<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.820> through<00:01:51.060> testing

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
get all the way through testing

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.090 
get all the way through testing
obviously<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.110> thrown<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:52.590> before<00:01:52.829> they

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
obviously they thrown it out before they

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
obviously they thrown it out before they
went<00:01:53.399> through<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> polished<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> completely

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
went through and polished it completely

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
went through and polished it completely
but<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.490> interesting<00:01:56.850> idea

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but it's a really interesting idea

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.789 
but it's a really interesting idea
although<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.350> make<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.530> lot<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
although I think would make a lot of

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
although I think would make a lot of
people<00:01:59.100> frustrated<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.180> glad<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.869> in

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
people frustrated so I'm glad it's in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.260 
people frustrated so I'm glad it's in
the<00:02:01.110> game<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.649> skeptical<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.210> do

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the game and I'm skeptical if they do

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.719 
the game and I'm skeptical if they do
end<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.049> releasing<00:02:04.500> them<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> polishing<00:02:05.579> them

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
end up releasing them and polishing them

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.059 
end up releasing them and polishing them
maybe<00:02:05.939> that'll<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> thing<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.890> like

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
maybe that'll be like a thing with like

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.770 
maybe that'll be like a thing with like
one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> map<00:02:08.729> packs<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:09.569> come

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
one of the map packs you know they come

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.479 
one of the map packs you know they come
out<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> new<00:02:10.500> armor<00:02:10.920> abilities<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
out with like a new armor abilities that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.059 
out with like a new armor abilities that
could<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.090> cool

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
could be really cool

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.530 
could be really cool
think<00:02:13.249> that<00:02:13.370> would<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.579> freaking<00:02:14.120> awesome<00:02:14.239> but

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
think that would be freaking awesome but

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.679 
think that would be freaking awesome but
uh<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:16.310> know<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.609> they<00:02:16.819> do<00:02:16.879> release<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.540> one

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
uh you know if they do release this one

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.690 
uh you know if they do release this one
I<00:02:17.719> hope<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.079> maybe<00:02:18.290> tone<00:02:18.590> down<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:19.069> fixed<00:02:19.579> cuz

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
I hope it's maybe tone down or fixed cuz

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
I hope it's maybe tone down or fixed cuz
that<00:02:19.849> seems<00:02:20.030> crazy<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:21.019> other<00:02:21.049> one<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.379> this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that seems crazy the other one is this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.369 
that seems crazy the other one is this
hacker<00:02:22.209> ability<00:02:23.209> which<00:02:23.359> is<00:02:23.510> really<00:02:23.840> cool<00:02:24.139> and
