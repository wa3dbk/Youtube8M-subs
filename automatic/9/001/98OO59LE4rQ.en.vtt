does is it converts the calories your
calories<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:35.280> heat<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.020> happens<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
calories into heat so what happens is it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
calories into heat so what happens is it
converts<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:37.950> calories<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> heat<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
converts those calories in the heat and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
converts those calories in the heat and
that's<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> boosts<00:01:41.460> your

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.650 
and some of Genesis within the body the
only<00:04:45.520> issue<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:45.850> that<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.390> can<00:04:46.540> eat<00:04:46.630> a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
only issue with that is you can eat a

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
thermogenesis but not necessarily be

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.100 
thermogenesis but not necessarily be
healthy<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.180> die<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:04.330> organs<00:05:04.840> because

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
healthy for you die just organs because

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.350 
healthy for you die just organs because
it<00:05:05.230> stresses<00:05:05.440> them<00:05:05.710> out<00:05:05.890> so<00:05:06.100> it's<00:05:06.910> smarter<00:05:07.240> to

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
it stresses them out so it's smarter to

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.850 
it stresses them out so it's smarter to
use<00:05:07.420> herbs<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.990> spices<00:05:08.200> because<00:05:08.500> then<00:05:08.740> you're

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
use herbs and spices because then you're

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.070 
use herbs and spices because then you're
also<00:05:09.040> consuming<00:05:09.490> less<00:05:10.180> calories<00:05:10.690> which<00:05:10.870> has<00:05:11.050> a

also consuming less calories which has a

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.020 
also consuming less calories which has a

effect on how long you live in all these
little<00:05:13.180> different<00:05:13.600> things<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.020> just<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.500> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
little different things and just the the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.710 
little different things and just the the
flow<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.280> your<00:05:15.640> internal<00:05:16.240> good<00:05:16.450> dose<00:05:16.630> of

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
organs but it's just easier because you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.480 
organs but it's just easier because you
can<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.150> throw<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.510> herbs<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:19.750> spices<00:05:20.490> your
