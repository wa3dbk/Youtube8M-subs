00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
and a tail also it's a kind of more

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.519 
and a tail also it's a kind of more
round<00:00:28.119> -<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:30.189> are<00:00:30.369> thunder<00:00:31.140> 8-inch<00:00:32.140> trucks

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
round - these are thunder 8-inch trucks

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.630 
round - these are thunder 8-inch trucks
they're<00:00:32.950> the<00:00:34.260> titanium<00:00:35.260> lights<00:00:35.530> they're<00:00:36.520> not

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
they're the titanium lights they're not

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.069 
they're the titanium lights they're not
the<00:00:36.760> ones<00:00:36.910> at<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.090> hollow<00:00:37.239> king<00:00:37.629> pit<00:00:37.809> or<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
the ones at the hollow king pit or the

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.020 
the ones at the hollow king pit or the
hollow<00:00:38.230> axle<00:00:38.469> but<00:00:38.890> they<00:00:39.609> do<00:00:39.670> have<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.879> hollow

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
hollow axle but they do have a hollow

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.270 
hollow axle but they do have a hollow
kingpin<00:00:40.539> and<00:00:40.780> they're<00:00:41.320> all<00:00:41.469> titanium<00:00:42.129> so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
kingpin and they're all titanium so

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.479 
kingpin and they're all titanium so
they're<00:00:42.429> super<00:00:42.789> light<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:44.440> what<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.309> like

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
they're super light and I what I like

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.419 
they're super light and I what I like
about<00:00:45.609> the<00:00:45.789> titanium<00:00:46.329> is<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.949> your<00:00:47.949> bolts

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
about the titanium is that your bolts

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.430 
about the titanium is that your bolts
like<00:00:48.609> don't<00:00:48.850> really<00:00:48.940> get<00:00:49.239> worn<00:00:49.960> down<00:00:50.019> because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
like don't really get worn down because

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.989 
like don't really get worn down because
the<00:00:50.559> metal<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:50.980> hard<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:51.399> you<00:00:51.489> can<00:00:51.609> always<00:00:51.760> like

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
the metal so hard so you can always like

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.400 
the metal so hard so you can always like
you<00:00:52.179> never<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.510> screw<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.079> your<00:00:53.140> bolt

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
you never have that screw on your bolt

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.369 
you never have that screw on your bolt
probably<00:00:53.890> no<00:00:54.420> set<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.510> trucks<00:00:55.719> usually<00:00:56.140> last

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
probably no set of trucks usually last

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.790 
probably no set of trucks usually last
me<00:00:57.659> about<00:01:00.839> six<00:01:01.839> months<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.379> kind<00:01:02.530> of<00:01:02.559> depends

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
me about six months it kind of depends

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.140 
me about six months it kind of depends
on<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> bushings<00:01:03.399> like<00:01:03.579> if<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.819> bushings

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
on the bushings like if the bushings

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.230 
on the bushings like if the bushings
explode<00:01:04.770> sometimes<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:06.070> just<00:01:06.640> like<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.880> set<00:01:07.150> up

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
explode sometimes I just like to set up

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.940 
explode sometimes I just like to set up
new<00:01:07.360> trucks<00:01:07.630> rather<00:01:07.900> than<00:01:08.110> put<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.800> new

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
new trucks rather than put in new

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.020 
new trucks rather than put in new
bushings<00:01:09.369> but<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.990> ride<00:01:10.990> rikta<00:01:11.979> wheels<00:01:12.220> this<00:01:12.970> is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
bushings but I ride rikta wheels this is

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380 
bushings but I ride rikta wheels this is
the<00:01:14.070> energy<00:01:15.070> formula<00:01:15.610> they<00:01:15.759> came<00:01:16.210> out<00:01:16.329> with

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
the energy formula they came out with

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.179 
the energy formula they came out with
recently<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.049> kind<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.229> like<00:01:17.409> more<00:01:17.920> flat

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
recently it's kind of like more flat

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.889 
recently it's kind of like more flat
spot<00:01:18.460> resistant<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.149> uh<00:01:20.100> these<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.250> 52s

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
spot resistant and uh these are 52s

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.389 
spot resistant and uh these are 52s
sometimes<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:23.020> ride<00:01:23.140> fifty<00:01:23.469> ones<00:01:23.710> -<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.159> kind<00:01:24.340> of

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
sometimes I ride fifty ones - it kind of

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.539 
sometimes I ride fifty ones - it kind of
just<00:01:24.869> depends<00:01:25.869> on<00:01:26.020> I'm<00:01:26.140> skating<00:01:26.590> or<00:01:26.770> what<00:01:27.520> I

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
just depends on I'm skating or what I

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.359 
just depends on I'm skating or what I
grabbed<00:01:27.939> that<00:01:28.240> day<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:29.079> put<00:01:29.229> on<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.619> uh<00:01:29.649> I<00:01:29.979> like

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
grabbed that day to put on but uh I like

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.679 
grabbed that day to put on but uh I like
this<00:01:30.700> wheel<00:01:30.880> too<00:01:31.090> because<00:01:31.360> it's<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> different

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
this wheel too because it's a different

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.940 
this wheel too because it's a different
shape<00:01:32.020> than<00:01:32.259> like<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.439> lot<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.829> other

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
shape than like a lot of the other

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.880 
shape than like a lot of the other
victims<00:01:33.369> it's<00:01:33.490> kind<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.729> more<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:35.590> flat

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
victims it's kind of more like like flat

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.100 
victims it's kind of more like like flat
on<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.100> sides<00:01:36.250> kind<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.180> square<00:01:37.479> I<00:01:37.600> don't<00:01:37.840> like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
on the sides kind of square I don't like

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.740 
on the sides kind of square I don't like
it<00:01:38.280> feels<00:01:39.280> like<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.549> rocks<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.329> for<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.600> middle

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
it feels like it rocks in for the middle

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
it feels like it rocks in for the middle
surfing<00:01:41.289> up<00:01:41.439> I<00:01:41.649> ride<00:01:42.430> uh<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.110> fkd<00:01:44.680> bearings

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
surfing up I ride uh the fkd bearings

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.969 
surfing up I ride uh the fkd bearings
also<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:46.899> have<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.200> one<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.619> don't<00:01:47.680> even<00:01:47.829> know

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
also I have this one I don't even know

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.410 
also I have this one I don't even know
what<00:01:48.100> kind<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.310> hardware<00:01:48.579> this<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.939> but<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:49.390> has

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
what kind of hardware this is but it has

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.020 
what kind of hardware this is but it has
one<00:01:49.719> silver<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.320> always<00:01:51.250> put<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.549> silver<00:01:51.909> in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
one silver I always put the silver in

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.539 
one silver I always put the silver in
the<00:01:52.119> same<00:01:52.270> spot
