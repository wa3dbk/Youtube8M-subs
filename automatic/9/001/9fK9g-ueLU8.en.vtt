00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.570
 start aboghe ella the picture is just 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 a little sharper than that when time 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.980
 but the landscape left so I 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.980
 actually left the original settings 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.809

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.559

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.670
 I had not even appeared on wii put 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.950

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.650
 French no it's good so I'm not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.560
 here to talk to you about that but I want 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.070
 to make a game you present a trick 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.179
 yet finished when you noticed 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.249
 I have a lot of doors 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.439
 it's very very simple and well 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.649
 just have a snow door 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.630
 you throw the door in the snow and 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.829
 a second device I understand 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 still not maybe it's a 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.049
 problem like that but we win some 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 doors 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.100
 it's absolutely weird and you can 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.890
 put them anywhere or your ta ta ta 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.299

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.230
 metal and metal 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.950
 we find some in the soil and then there 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.340
 must be melted during the fondue 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.230
 which gives these ingots also bilingual 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.650
