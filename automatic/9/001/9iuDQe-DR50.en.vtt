if you bet the river he's probably going

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.740 
if you bet the river he's probably going
to<00:04:25.830> pay<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.070> off<00:04:26.280> an<00:04:26.520> overpair<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.300> once<00:04:27.450> again

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
to pay you off an overpair so once again

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.420 
to pay you off an overpair so once again
I<00:04:27.930> would<00:04:28.050> suggest<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.650> bet<00:04:28.800> between<00:04:28.980> nine<00:04:29.400> and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
I would suggest the bet between nine and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.520 
I would suggest the bet between nine and
twelve<00:04:29.790> thousand<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.630> eight<00:04:30.780> now<00:04:31.260> if<00:04:31.410> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
twelve thousand and eight now if the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.380 
twelve thousand and eight now if the
rivers<00:04:31.830> an<00:04:31.950> eight<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.370> gives<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> good

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390
