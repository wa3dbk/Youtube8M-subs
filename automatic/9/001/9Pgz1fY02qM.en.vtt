00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.589
 I mark 4 rectangles on cardboard 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.309
 the length of which is slightly larger than the width 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.079
 tips and sides i'm starting to glue here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.469
 my stripes are already with holes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 should get through these now 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.500
 holes I'm starting to push the twine here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 what I got 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.250
 Now I will show you how to 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 twine for starters every couple not so we 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.270
 feed in single nodules extremely thread 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 we remove from the remaining threads 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.370
 tying double knot 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.110
 now i take the last string and the next one 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.290
 and I also connect with a long knot 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.540
 I repeat the same way with the rest 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.030
 with each side taking two strings and 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.630
 we tie a double knot followed by 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.510
 and in the middle of the usual bundle on, I take 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.580
 three strings with edge and stars with a knot 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.460
 next just repeat the other 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.860
 countries further I distribute the thread in half 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.200
 and tie a big double knot out of them 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 that's what should be the other 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.670
