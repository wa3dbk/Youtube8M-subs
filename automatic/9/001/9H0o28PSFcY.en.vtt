00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
vodka and let it sit in a dark space for

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
vodka and let it sit in a dark space for
about<00:02:19.110> six<00:02:19.590> months<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> pull<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.150> out

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
about six months when you pull it out

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.020 
about six months when you pull it out
you're<00:02:21.600> gonna<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.230> most<00:02:22.470> incredible

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030

vanilla extract ever but the really cool

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760 
vanilla extract ever but the really cool
thing<00:02:26.940> about<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.230> starts<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
thing about this is when it starts to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.830 
thing about this is when it starts to
get<00:02:28.890> low<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.940> top<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.270> off<00:02:30.600> with

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
get low you can just top it off with

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
get low you can just top it off with
some<00:02:30.900> more<00:02:31.260> vodka<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.100> let<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.760> sit<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.270> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
some more vodka and let it sit and it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.020 
some more vodka and let it sit and it
will<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.050> keep<00:02:34.260> replenishing<00:02:34.830> over<00:02:35.790> time

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
will just keep replenishing over time

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.990
