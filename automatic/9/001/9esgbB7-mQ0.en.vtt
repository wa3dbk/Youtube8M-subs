00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 today japanese curry 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.600
 made in chile 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:13.320
 we need an onion 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.900
 for the carrot two potatoes 200 grams of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.900
 ground beef tomato natural history 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.770
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 the potatoes and hopefully they are in a size 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.890
 relatively small in this recipe use 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.890
 a lot but I with 22 big nothing else 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.039
 because you can go back very stirrups 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.540
 then we cut the onion 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.130
 We cut in half the half 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.610
 and later 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.270
 in a measure like half a centimeter 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.559
 each piece will hopefully be in strips 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.559
 as seen in the video 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.270
 then the carrot 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.270
 It has to be cut into slices 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.300
 hopefully fine so they are not left 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 doubts when eating 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.320
 with everything 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250
 Y 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.190
 we are ready 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.020
 the garlics 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 for this recipe v2 the size 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 or less large 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.590
 finally cut 10 julian to 2 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.780
 the future 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.960
 kiss 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.069
 and we prepare 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.069
 to start throwing the whole pot 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.270
 the first thing is olive oil 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.200
 if we enter 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.870
 onion and carrot 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 to give them the famous fried 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.820
 then we stir 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.180
 we open a space to throw flour 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.870
 that will allow us to give a thickness of our 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870
 curry 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.250
 important toast the sand to 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.250
 later to throw water 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.110
 there we throw some water and stir 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.540
 and we think well Latinos 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.540
 it is important to do well this 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.460
 we add the curry 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.740
 and if you want 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.740
 a warm 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.150
 we started the meat 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.769
 you have to be in touch mind hitting 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.610
 the meat so that they tear themselves apart 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.520
 little bits 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.930
 we do not want the whole piece 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.930
 we enter the potatoes 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.110
 we fill with water not in excess 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.639
 we want the tomato that is how you can 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.639
 see there and we revolve 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 Japanese curry ready to go with rice 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.680
 White 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.710

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.370
