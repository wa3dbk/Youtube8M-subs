00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
then 52 as you can see it gives me a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.810 
then 52 as you can see it gives me a
spawner<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.100> that's<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> spawner

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
spawner and that's how you get a spawner

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
spawner and that's how you get a spawner
but<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.259> find<00:01:34.560> any<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.810> any<00:01:36.979> block<00:01:37.979> which

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
has got a red Dec number and it should

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.870 
has got a red Dec number and it should
say<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> icon<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> actual

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
say like next to the icon of the actual

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.230 
say like next to the icon of the actual
thing<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.880> type<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thing which is so I could just type in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.749

like /give 14 master set 451 and this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
like /give 14 master set 451 and this
will<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.030> me<00:01:54.119> fire<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.470> you

torch<00:02:47.360> which<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:50.480> 75

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
torch which is off and that is 75

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.110 
torch which is off and that is 75
properly<00:02:52.080> yes<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.700> off<00:02:53.880> but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
properly yes you can see it's off but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.240 
properly yes you can see it's off but
then<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.570> put<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> block<00:02:55.020> next<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
then if I put a block next to it it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.840 
then if I put a block next to it it
updates<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.910> block<00:02:57.150> data<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.440> will<00:02:58.560> need<00:02:58.740> to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
updates a block data so you will need to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.890 
updates a block data so you will need to
have<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.030> all<00:03:00.210> right<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:02.570> think<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.840> I'm

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
have it all right so or I think so I'm

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.370 
have it all right so or I think so I'm
not<00:03:04.260> touching<00:03:04.710> or<00:03:04.920> anything<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:06.380> so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
not touching or anything like that so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.200 
not touching or anything like that so
what<00:03:07.500> else<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.740> there<00:03:07.800> or<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.820> also<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
what else is there or you can also get a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.760 
what else is there or you can also get a
portal<00:03:09.840> which<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.230> 90<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.680> I

just have to I know the first one on the
right<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.739> piston<00:03:43.739> extended<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.370> that's<00:03:44.550> 34

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
right is a piston extended and that's 34

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.000 
right is a piston extended and that's 34
for<00:03:47.250> DC<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.410> would<00:03:49.620> they

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
for DC so you see that it would they

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.560 
for DC so you see that it would they
look<00:03:50.220> like<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.520> in<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.730> kind<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.150> writing

look like that in that kind of writing

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.300 
look like that in that kind of writing
so<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.989> numbers<00:03:52.440> will<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.700> red<00:03:54.600> writing<00:03:55.310> so

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
so the numbers will be in red writing so

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.630 
so the numbers will be in red writing so
