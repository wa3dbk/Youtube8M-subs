direction my daughter's a big fan we
were<00:00:06.540> looking<00:00:06.870> online<00:00:07.020> on<00:00:07.589> YouTube<00:00:07.770> trying<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
were looking online on YouTube trying to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
were looking online on YouTube trying to
find<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> tube<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> cords<00:00:09.690> were

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
find the tube and what the cords were

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
find the tube and what the cords were
couldn't<00:00:10.679> really<00:00:10.800> find<00:00:11.040> anything<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.610> took

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
couldn't really find anything that took

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.640 
couldn't really find anything that took
us<00:00:11.880> through<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> full<00:00:12.300> song<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.380> certainly

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
us through the full song and certainly

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
us through the full song and certainly
on<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.799> colored<00:00:14.130> taps<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:14.519> seem<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.730> either

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
on the colored taps they seem to either

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.670 
on the colored taps they seem to either
be<00:00:15.150> wrong<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:15.750> again<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.260> had<00:00:16.379> gaps

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
be wrong or again just had gaps

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
be wrong or again just had gaps
particularly<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> bridge<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.119> some

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
particularly for the bridge for some

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
particularly for the bridge for some
reason<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.779> guess<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:19.619> they<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
reason I guess because they have a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
reason I guess because they have a
couple<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> slightly<00:00:21.270> harder<00:00:21.510> chords<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
couple of slightly harder chords in the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.890 
couple of slightly harder chords in the
bridge<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.330> put<00:00:24.840> together

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
bridge so this is what I put together

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
bridge so this is what I put together
hopefully<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.769> pretty<00:00:26.699> much<00:00:26.849> right

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hopefully it's pretty much right

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.179 
hopefully it's pretty much right
hopefully<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.689> fun<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.349> useful<00:00:29.689> ok<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
hopefully my fun this useful ok so the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.610 
hopefully my fun this useful ok so the
neutral<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:32.730> bars<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.149> C<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.380> see

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
neutral has two bars of C going to see

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
neutral has two bars of C going to see
rather<00:00:34.829> than<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.280> minor<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:37.440> G<00:00:37.910> then<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
rather than a minor to G then one of

so the second course okay the only bit
that's<00:04:51.600> different<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.050> ends<00:04:52.320> but<00:04:53.240> which<00:04:54.240> I

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
that's different is ends but which I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.690 
that's different is ends but which I
