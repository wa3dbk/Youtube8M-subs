00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a long time but I do remember this movie

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:38.649

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
got it used and I guess they must have

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.070 
got it used and I guess they must have
taken<00:01:43.740> him<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.130> something<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:45.080> anyway

hadn't seen this one either but I did
give<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.600> another<00:02:06.869> watch<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
give it another watch and it was a

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.609 
give it another watch and it was a
pretty<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:08.880> film<00:02:09.149> wasn't<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.929> best<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.470> my

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
pretty good film wasn't the best in my

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.270 
pretty good film wasn't the best in my
opinion<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.780> seemed<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> short<00:02:13.560> when<00:02:14.220> I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
opinion it seemed kind of short when I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.470 
opinion it seemed kind of short when I
watched<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:21.319> anyway<00:02:22.319> there's<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> first<00:02:22.890> disc

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.240 
after I left the house I felt like crap
and<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:51.410> really<00:05:52.410> at<00:05:52.500> times<00:05:52.710> felt<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:53.040> I<00:05:53.130> was

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
and I really at times felt like I was

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.850 
and I really at times felt like I was
going<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.460> pass<00:05:53.640> out<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:54.350> I<00:05:55.350> remember<00:05:55.740> having

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
going to pass out and I remember having

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.890 
going to pass out and I remember having
to<00:05:56.100> wait<00:05:56.280> until<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.730> person<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.240> was<00:05:57.360> with<00:05:57.510> to

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
to wait until the person I was with to

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.450 
to wait until the person I was with to
finish<00:05:58.260> their<00:05:58.470> shopping<00:05:58.770> which<00:05:59.070> took<00:05:59.250> forever

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
finish their shopping which took forever

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.420 
finish their shopping which took forever
so<00:06:00.180> yeah<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.050> was<00:06:01.230> pretty<00:06:01.320> miserable<00:06:02.040> and<00:06:02.220> in

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.060

the<00:06:03.090> end<00:06:03.240> like<00:06:03.390> after<00:06:03.630> I<00:06:03.660> got<00:06:03.900> home<00:06:04.200> I<00:06:04.440> thought
