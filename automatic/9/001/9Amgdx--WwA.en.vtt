ass<00:00:46.620> title<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.100> let's<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
ass title but let's just get into it

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
ass title but let's just get into it
first<00:00:49.379> step<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.770> flip<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> spawn<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
first step is to flip the spawn if you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
first step is to flip the spawn if you
spawn<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.750> flag<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.379> eventually<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.070> will

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
spawn a flag which eventually you will

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
spawn a flag which eventually you will
since<00:00:53.520> there's<00:00:53.699> two<00:00:53.850> rounds<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.960> need<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
since there's two rounds you need to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.630 
since there's two rounds you need to
flip<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> spawn<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> enemies<00:00:56.610> are

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
flip the spawn so the enemies are

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
flip the spawn so the enemies are
spawning<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.270> instead<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> do

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
spawning a instead of you so what you do

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
spawning a instead of you so what you do
is<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.910> entire<00:01:00.180> team<00:01:00.480> spread<00:01:01.109> out

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
is you have your entire team spread out

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
is you have your entire team spread out
along<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.680> map<00:01:01.890> move<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.699> fast<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.270> can

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
along the map move as fast as they can

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.050 
along the map move as fast as they can
to<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.809> cap<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> sea<00:01:04.860> flag<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.700> push

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to see cap the sea flag and then push

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
to see cap the sea flag and then push
back<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.450> their<00:01:06.900> positions<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.950> enemies

back into their positions the enemies

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
back into their positions the enemies
should<00:01:08.520> spawn<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> they'll<00:01:09.540> distinctively

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
should spawn a and they'll distinctively

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
should spawn a and they'll distinctively

players they'll pass a guardian and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
players they'll pass a guardian and
they'll<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.149> put<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> white<00:01:58.259> van

they'll just put it down by a white van

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590 
they'll just put it down by a white van
and<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.159> looking<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> way<00:02:00.030> and

and just kind of looking this way and

and just kind of looking this way and
that<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:01.259> doesn't<00:02:01.560> work<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.430> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that actually doesn't work as you can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
that actually doesn't work as you can
see<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> enemy<00:02:03.149> team<00:02:03.540> will<00:02:03.719> still<00:02:03.990> spawn<00:02:04.439> on

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
see the enemy team will still spawn on

see the enemy team will still spawn on
the<00:02:04.950> driveway<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> bottom<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> it

the driveway just at the bottom of it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479 
the driveway just at the bottom of it
and<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.979> around<00:02:08.310> through

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and they can actually go around through

and they can actually go around through
art<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> driveway<00:02:10.229> and

art or go up through the driveway and
destroy<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> Guardian<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.790> actually

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
destroy the Guardian and that actually

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.730 
destroy the Guardian and that actually
does<00:02:12.270> break<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> spawn<00:02:12.959> trap

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
does break the spawn trap

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220 
does break the spawn trap
so<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:14.850> you're<00:02:14.970> placing<00:02:15.150> Guardians<00:02:15.780> make

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so when you're placing Guardians make

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.750 
so when you're placing Guardians make
sure<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.800> where<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.100> placing<00:02:17.400> them

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
sure you know where you're placing them

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
sure you know where you're placing them
you<00:02:18.240> can<00:02:18.390> only<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.780> four<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> map<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
you can only have four on the map at the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.310 
you can only have four on the map at the
same<00:02:20.100> time<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.330> make<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:21.900> using<00:02:21.930> them

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
same time so make sure you're using them

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.800 
same time so make sure you're using them
very<00:02:22.680> effectively<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:23.670> bigger<00:02:24.240> maps<00:02:24.540> like

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
very effectively on bigger maps like

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
very effectively on bigger maps like
Yemen<00:02:25.020> or<00:02:25.230> meltdown<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.070> need<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.610> four<00:02:26.910> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
Yemen or meltdown you need all four of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.240 
Yemen or meltdown you need all four of
those<00:02:27.150> Guardians<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.750> different<00:02:28.110> spots<00:02:28.320> don't

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
those Guardians in different spots don't

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.070 
those Guardians in different spots don't
double<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.850> guardian<00:02:30.270> spots<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:30.960> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
double up on guardian spots and if you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.960 
double up on guardian spots and if you
don't<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.470> where<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> put<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> guardian<00:02:32.340> don't

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
don't know where to put a guardian don't

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.140 
don't know where to put a guardian don't
run<00:02:33.180> them<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> first<00:02:33.780> place<00:02:34.850> also<00:02:35.850> it's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
run them in the first place also it's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.580 
run them in the first place also it's
important<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.630> mention<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.020> these<00:02:37.260> spots

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
important to mention that these spots

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.730 
important to mention that these spots
are<00:02:37.740> listed<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.340> order<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.760> importance<00:02:39.740> spots

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
are listed in order of importance spots

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920 
are listed in order of importance spots
like<00:02:40.950> blue<00:02:41.190> van<00:02:41.460> aren't<00:02:41.850> even<00:02:42.060> necessary<00:02:42.660> if

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
like blue van aren't even necessary if

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.960 
like blue van aren't even necessary if
you're<00:02:43.440> pushing<00:02:43.860> up<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.610> left<00:02:44.790> side

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
you're pushing up on the left side

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.540 
you're pushing up on the left side
really<00:02:45.360> lightly<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:47.100> with<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.520> mind

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
really lightly so with that in mind

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.060 
really lightly so with that in mind
don't<00:02:48.480> place<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.200> spots<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.800> aren't

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
don't place them in spots that aren't

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.550 
don't place them in spots that aren't
ramp<00:02:50.610> or<00:02:50.850> bedroom<00:02:51.030> first<00:02:51.570> because<00:02:52.170> those<00:02:52.350> are

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
ramp or bedroom first because those are

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.150 
ramp or bedroom first because those are
very<00:02:52.860> crucial<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> spawn<00:02:53.880> trap<00:02:55.160> alright

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
very crucial to the spawn trap alright

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.620 
very crucial to the spawn trap alright
the<00:02:56.280> next<00:02:56.460> step<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.940> need<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.360> is

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
the next step you need to know is

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.320 
the next step you need to know is
learning<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.650> other<00:02:58.860> spawns<00:02:59.490> in<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.090> map

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
learning all the other spawns in the map

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.850 
learning all the other spawns in the map
and<00:03:00.750> we're<00:03:00.930> going<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.350> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> same

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and we're going to do this at the same

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860 
and we're going to do this at the same
time<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.250> actually<00:03:02.970> setting<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.630> spawn

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
time as actually setting up the spawn

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.540 
time as actually setting up the spawn
trap<00:03:04.170> I'll<00:03:04.380> teach<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.740> them<00:03:04.890> both<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
trap I'll teach you them both at the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.640 
trap I'll teach you them both at the
same<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.750> first<00:03:06.930> spot<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.410> most

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
same time the first spot is the most

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.470 
same time the first spot is the most
important<00:03:08.190> spot<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> game<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.240> in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
important spot in the game and that's in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.840 
important spot in the game and that's in
kitchen<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.680> spots<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.340> important

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
kitchen this spots really important

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.240 
kitchen this spots really important
because<00:03:11.910> instantly<00:03:12.720> when<00:03:13.590> an<00:03:13.740> enemy<00:03:13.890> team

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
because instantly when an enemy team

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.370 
because instantly when an enemy team
spawns<00:03:14.580> at<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.820> back<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.390> domination<00:03:15.990> flag

spawns at the back of a domination flag
they're<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.130> immediately<00:03:17.520> flood<00:03:18.120> into

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
they're going to immediately flood into

they're going to immediately flood into
this<00:03:18.540> building<00:03:19.080> as<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.430> novice<00:03:21.150> player

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
this building as you see a novice player

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.540 
this building as you see a novice player
will<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.780> run<00:03:21.990> straight<00:03:22.140> forward<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:22.920> the

kitchen is the first building that they

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.200 
kitchen is the first building that they
would<00:03:25.590> say<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.040> they<00:03:26.430> probably<00:03:26.700> spray<00:03:27.030> down

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
would say and they probably spray down

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.640 
would say and they probably spray down
and<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.540> would<00:03:27.690> break<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.140> spawn<00:03:28.380> trapped

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
and that would break the spawn trapped

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.110 
and that would break the spawn trapped
again<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.100> middle<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.490> flank<00:03:29.730> left<00:03:29.820> and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
again to middle and flank left and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.670 
again to middle and flank left and
rights<00:03:30.300> but<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.840> you're<00:03:31.050> there<00:03:31.350> you're<00:03:31.620> there

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
rights but if you're there you're there

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.560 
rights but if you're there you're there

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
of the map it's really simple but you

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.700 
of the map it's really simple but you
just<00:05:52.330> have<00:05:52.480> to<00:05:52.630> remember<00:05:52.870> one<00:05:53.290> thing<00:05:53.320> no

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
just have to remember one thing no

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.580 
just have to remember one thing no
matter<00:05:53.950> where<00:05:54.640> you<00:05:54.670> stand<00:05:55.360> there<00:05:56.020> actually<00:05:56.440> is

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
matter where you stand there actually is

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.100 
matter where you stand there actually is
a<00:05:56.650> spawn<00:05:57.220> point<00:05:57.610> that<00:05:57.970> you're<00:05:58.150> canceling<00:05:58.870> out

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
a spawn point that you're canceling out

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.920 
a spawn point that you're canceling out
the<00:05:59.280> enemies<00:06:00.280> will<00:06:00.550> flip<00:06:00.880> spawn<00:06:01.270> right<00:06:01.750> in

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
the enemies will flip spawn right in

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.380 
the enemies will flip spawn right in
front<00:06:02.140> of<00:06:02.290> bottom<00:06:02.740> bedroom<00:06:03.130> right<00:06:03.310> there<00:06:03.790> so

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
front of bottom bedroom right there so

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.880 
front of bottom bedroom right there so
you<00:06:04.480> need<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:04.870> have<00:06:04.930> players<00:06:05.200> on<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.500> bottom

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
you need to have players on the bottom

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.650 
you need to have players on the bottom
of<00:06:06.010> that<00:06:06.160> canceling<00:06:06.640> outs<00:06:06.790> so<00:06:07.330> if<00:06:07.420> you're<00:06:07.540> in

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
of that canceling outs so if you're in

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.270 
of that canceling outs so if you're in
top<00:06:07.990> bedroom<00:06:08.470> doing<00:06:08.680> this<00:06:08.770> which<00:06:08.950> is<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.100> good

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
top bedroom doing this which is a good

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.580 
top bedroom doing this which is a good
spot<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:10.360> just<00:06:10.600> won't<00:06:10.720> cancel<00:06:10.990> out<00:06:11.170> that<00:06:11.320> spawn

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
spot it just won't cancel out that spawn

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.700 
spot it just won't cancel out that spawn
point<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:13.090> that's<00:06:13.420> pretty<00:06:13.930> much<00:06:14.170> it<00:06:14.410> that's

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
point so that's pretty much it that's

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.740 
point so that's pretty much it that's
how<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:14.890> set<00:06:15.310> up<00:06:15.340> on<00:06:15.790> raid<00:06:16.090> raid<00:06:16.420> is<00:06:16.630> the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
how you set up on raid raid is the

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.140 
how you set up on raid raid is the
easiest<00:06:17.290> map<00:06:17.590> to<00:06:17.830> spawn<00:06:18.100> trap<00:06:18.430> it<00:06:18.700> should<00:06:19.060> be

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
easiest map to spawn trap it should be

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.120 
easiest map to spawn trap it should be
pretty<00:06:19.720> much<00:06:19.840> self-explanatory<00:06:20.350> but<00:06:21.010> i

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
pretty much self-explanatory but i

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.070 
pretty much self-explanatory but i
thought<00:06:21.310> i<00:06:21.370> just<00:06:21.520> do<00:06:21.640> this<00:06:21.760> commentary<00:06:22.570> just

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
thought i just do this commentary just

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.810 
thought i just do this commentary just
